<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., using the tooth to pick the lock). The final action of lighting the lighthouse is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the emotional weight of loss and memory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost (harbor leaning toward brightness as forgiveness). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with imagery building to a decisive reweighting. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details (e.g., "neon sighs," silver moonlight) filtered through POV. The harbor and lighthouse constrain choices (locked gate, need to relight), and recurring objects (tooth, pots) charge the final image, altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (relighting the lighthouse as signal) escalates through protagonist agency (rowing, picking lock, cleaning lantern). Under the Accumulative lens, density increases with cost felt in effort and emotional weight, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of mending and light emerges through concrete images (gardening, lockpicking) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (rooting light at home) that reweights prior material, with subtext in gestures like pointing as prayer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control (e.g., "steady, counting breaths"). No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off, with perceptual signature consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied syntax, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (e.g., "harbor waits like a sleeping lung"), and propulsion is clear even in peak beats without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of gardening and lockpicking metaphors feels inevitable, with specific details (bitting gauge tooth) transforming familiar themes. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure is charged with innovation.</comment>
