<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Jae's characterization is concrete and motivated, with embodied traits like "roughened by cold" and a clear drive to prove sideways time. His internal conflict between biological and temporal fears adds depth, and his actions under pressure, such as pulling the lever, align with his motives. The final choice to set markers for proof is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the surge and his subtle return.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the mantas' return and Jae's proof of sideways time, under a Hybrid lens leaning Causal. The magnetic nexus constrains tactics, and cost is legible in the surge and Jae's altered return. Orientation is clear early, and causality holds from probe creation to resolution without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail like "frost smoked off the solar arrays" and the ravine's magnetic nexus. The environment constrains key choices, such as the lever pull in the vault, and charges the final image with the mantas' lateral movement. Sensory hierarchy reflects Jae's professional focus, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mantas' return and proving sideways time) escalates under the Hybrid lens through Jae's agency, from building the probe to inverting fields. Cost is unmistakable in the surge tides and the "delayed selves" at closure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the lever pull triggers the resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sideways time emerges organically through events and images like "orthogonal now" and the mantas' lateral wake, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Jae's proof and the conceptual repricing of time, enriched by subtext in the station's acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature ("icy warmth," "sideways time") that modulates under pressure. Voice remains coherent through turns, and purposeful elision (e.g., "orthogonal now") is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, as in "architecture of delayed reflections," without muddling peak beats. Momentum is sustained through concise, image-driven advances.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story synthesizes time theory and xenobiology with a fresh, non-obvious angle, transforming tropes through specific details like the magnetic nexus and holographic principles. Risk-taking in structure and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
