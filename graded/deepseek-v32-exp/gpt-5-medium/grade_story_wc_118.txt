<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The historian's porous nature and motivation to collect stories are consistently embodied through micro-choices like touching the tapestry and rearranging the library. His final renunciation—teaching walls to speak—is earned by prior causality with visible cost, foreclosing human dreams. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost: the shift from human dreams to wall-echoes reweights the premise. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with patterns building to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early, and the displaced axis acts as a persistent constraint shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image—the silo's structure influences shelving decisions, and the tapestry fragment returns with reweighted meaning. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the historian's perception, with the environment mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving stories) escalates under the accumulative lens through the historian's agency—probing diaries, finding the disk—culminating in a cost-legible deepening. The final reconfiguration narrows options, foreclosing dreams in favor of echoes, with the cost felt in the bronze quiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of listening and displacement emerges through particulars like the tapestry and diaries, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the historian's decision to "stitch a world from echoes." Subtext operates in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and rhythmic control under pressure. The perceptual signature—noticing "brick tone" and "breath of paper"—is character-specific. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity. Sentences advance story and atmosphere, with no artifacts obscuring causality or closure, even in peak beats like "dust flurries like moths."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes post-dream silence and wall-listening into a fresh, non-obvious angle. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with specific details like the brass disk transforming familiar tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
