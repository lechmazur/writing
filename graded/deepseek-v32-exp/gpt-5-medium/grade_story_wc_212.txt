<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is deeply rooted in inheritance and purpose, with embodied emotion like "furiously tranquil" hands. The final choice to plant the cap is earned through prior causality, showing a credible endurance with cost in passing the song. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in planting the cap and thawing the promise. Cost is legible in "enough to thaw a promise," and orientation is clear early. Vortex inheritance constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (icebound atrium, starlight, scent of rain) are selective and purposeful, filtering through POV. The setting pressures choices, like the groaning atrium and ice-veined windows, and the oak acorn cap charges the final image, constraining the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving inheritance escalates under Accumulative lens through the vortex's unfurling and protagonist's agency in singing and planting. Cost is visible in the thawed promise, and escalation is driven by protagonist's actions, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical time and entropy emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures like tapping the wrist with the cap. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in planting the cap and teaching the song, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control, evident in phrases like "breath hangs like frost-laced bells." Purposeful compression and patterned diction are taught early and paid off at closure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "vortex like a candle flame," and propulsion is clear even in peak beats. Sentence-level craft supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original premise of vortex inheritance and seed saver in glass city offers a fresh synthesis, transformed through specific details like the oak acorn cap. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
