<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrator's grief and the guardian's silent empathy are concretely embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a hierarchy of values. The narrator's final confession and acceptance are earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the emotional unburdening. The guardian's consistency and the narrator's internal conflict show contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the narrator's voice returning "like floodwater" and the mirror's light symbolizing enduring hope. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with patterns of light and silence intensifying to reconfigure meaning. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, canal, and shutters function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image, such as the guardian using shutters to weave patterns that open "rooms where grief lay." Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the narrator's bias, with spatial choreography remaining clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency, as the narrator's participation in the guardian's rituals deepens the stake of confronting grief, culminating in a cost-legible confession. The dominant stake of healing from loss tightens through pattern breaks and cadence shifts, foreclosing the path of silent suffering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions, such as the dental mirror representing "light too shy to arrive," with subtext in gesture and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to grief through the final image of "water kept the lesson," avoiding moralizing while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic diction and rhythmic control under pressure. The guardian's signed communication and the narrator's internal voice remain coherent, with purposeful elision (e.g., "He did not speak, but the canal mouthed little statements") taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language coherent and purposeful in peak beats (e.g., "My voice returned like floodwater"). No loops, scaffold, or register drift; sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and the closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of silent empathy, light-weaving, and grief transformation feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in lyric mode heightening stakes without gimmickry. The guardian's unique methods and the dental mirror's reweighted meaning offer a fresh, non-obvious angle on healing.</comment>
