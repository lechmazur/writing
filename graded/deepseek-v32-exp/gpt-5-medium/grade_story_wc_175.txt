<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist's motive to honor overlooked histories is clear and consistent, driving micro-choices like building transient structures. Interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., "I felt the place read it with patient intelligence." However, the esoteric realist perspective leans abstract, with minimal internal contradiction under pressure, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong; closure is a Charged Poise with felt cost in the transient structures and promise to "stitch names from moss." Orientation is clear within 120 words. The ending reconfigures meaning through the final image of waiting for history, with cost legible in the overlooked histories.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, e.g., "water tapped an interrupted cadence," and actively constrains choices by supplying reeds, pebbles. The grotto and objects like the moth wing charge the final image, shaping the protagonist's tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (honoring histories) escalate through protagonist's agency in building signals and interacting with the monarch. Under accumulative lens, density increases with patterns like "long short long short" heartbeat, and cost is visible in transience. Minor deduction for less overt tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transience and witness emerges organically through images and actions, e.g., "building temporary structures as signals." Subtext is rich in gestures like tying the knot, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature evident in phrases like "blushing stillness." Rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping; purposeful elision (e.g., "overlooked histories") is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "burned syllable of orange" is consistent and clear. High information density advances story without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of transience and memory through specific details like moth wing and temporary structures. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the perspective feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
