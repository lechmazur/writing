<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with "featherly determined" trait constraining actions. Micro-choices under pressure, like analyzing the grain, reveal hierarchy of values. Final renunciation to keep distance is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the ache breathed in. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with pattern-based escalation through logbook and grain analysis leading to Conceptual Repricing closure. Orientation is clear within 120 words: lost child on drifting terrace after butterfly effect. Cost is legible in the final image of loving without closing space, charging the threshold as companion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image: the drifting prism terrace's facets and benches pressure discovery, while grain analysis directly enables the climax. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like wind smelling of sugar glass. Spatial choreography is coherent, with the seam threshold guiding the protagonist's palm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding sacred thresholds) escalates under accumulative lens through protagonist's agency in analyzing codes and grain. Meaningful tightening occurs when codes align with wood, forcing a choice to keep distance with cost felt in "ache." No coincidence; resolution earned by alteration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of necessary distances emerges through particulars like logbook codes and grain patterns, not statement. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via the image of threshold as companion, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in whispers and implications, avoiding tidy resolutions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, biased toward poetic observation ("rows closed behind me and the moon withheld its map"). Rhythmic control under pressure, with purposeful compression in peaks. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent and specific throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and legible, e.g., "terrace drifted like a raft of light." Sentence-level propulsion matches scene needs, with clarity in key beats like code alignment. No register drift or artifice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of concepts (drifting terrace, weather codes, maze architecture) feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific lived detail. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, with closure reconfiguring meaning organically.</comment>
