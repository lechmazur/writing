<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to "forge beauty from anarchy" is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values. The molting personality trait creates internal conflict and costs, earning the final endurance. Relationship with Lio acts as crucible, forcing choices that alter their shared mission.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the library revival crystallizes hope and continuity, with cost legible in the poet's transient nature and communal effort. Orientation is clear early, and pattern taught through recurring images pays off at ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the rusted library functioning as micro-setting that constrains choices (e.g., rebuilding with found materials) and charges the final image. Sensory details like "rain and iron" and "wind plays it anyway" are filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving beauty and community escalates under accumulative lens through protagonist agency in rebuilding and distributing poems, narrowing options as demolition threat looms. Cost is visible in effort and personal transience, forcing a trade-off that forecloses other paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Themes of resistance, transience, and beauty emerge organically from particulars like the coffee tin map and penny phrases, with subtext in gestures and images. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "blue lid" dawn, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature; diction and rhythm control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with Lio's laugh "carrying the clink of keys" reinforcing character distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language like "stacks are ribs" is coherent and purpose-driven, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative texture without sluggishness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of vagrant poet and library resistance feels inevitable, with specific details like pennies engraved with verbs transforming familiar tropes. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure integrates premise fully with conceptual integrity.</comment>
