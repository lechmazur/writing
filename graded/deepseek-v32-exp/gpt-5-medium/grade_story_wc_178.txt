<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's frugality and devotion are consistently embodied, with micro-choices under pressure leading to an earned vow; interiority is concrete and character-particular, though internal conflict is minimal, the final renunciation carries visible cost in time and resources.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the vow reconfigures commitment to the palace with felt cost in the final image; orientation is clear early, and causality flows seamlessly from discovery to pledge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices via the alcove and wires, with sensory details like "plaster buckled like a dried river" charging the final image; palace as micro-setting pressures tactics and deepens atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes of preserving knowledge escalate through protagonist's agency in following the tile's clues; cost is legible in his pledge of oil and hours, narrowing options under the accumulative lens without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of devotion through frugality emerges organically from arithmetic and stone, with subtext in "encrypted devotion"; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, poetic yet controlled; voice modulates with pressure, as in "dusky harmony like violet silk," and elision is purposeful, teaching patterns paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds; figurative language like "shadow traced the lattice" serves atmosphere without muddle, and propulsion remains clear through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of Babylonian palace and astronomical devotion feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the concept is transformed through specific, grounded details.</comment>
