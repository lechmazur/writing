<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion. The final renunciation of physical movement is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the pulse being heard but not possessed. Contradictory impulses between action and stillness act simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost ("less alone for having been heard"). Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with pattern-based escalation. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of stillness shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details filtered through POV. The canyon and bones constrain choices and charge the final image, acting as tuning forks that pressure the protagonist's methods. Specificity elevates atmosphere without generic placeholder.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigating without moving) escalates through accumulative density, driven by protagonist's agency in attention and stillness. Cost is legible on-page in the pulse's isolation and the renunciation of physical skimming. One meaningful tightening deepens the stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in gestures like tying the arrowhead. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to stillness and connection, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful compression and elision taught early. No head-hopping; diction matches the narrator's lexicon under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied syntax, with clear propulsion and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Read-aloud rhythm supports accumulative tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of mystical and practical elements. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the pulse and bone towers. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
