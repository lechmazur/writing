<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., descending to the library and aligning the lens). Interiority is concrete and embodied, as in "I hold the glass and feel chased stillness breathing behind me." The final choice to create the beacon is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the transformation of the library.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the library becomes a permanent address, with cost legible in "the water slackens like a vow kept." The causal lens holds throughout, from package arrival to beacon creation. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "shelves lean like old divers" and "water is thin as breath." The underwater library constrains choices and charges the final image, as the lens is used to transform the space. Micro-setting elements (e.g., the lens) are integrated into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from receiving the package to facing the mantled thing and aligning the lens. Dominant stake (giving rest a permanent address) tightens with visible cost, such as the dome stopping its groan. No coincidental resolutions; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as rest as location and memory, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in "the beacon we release does not command return; it revitalizes staying." Subtext operates through implication, like "chased stillness" representing quiet's desire for release.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: weary, poetic, and rhythmic, as in "I am a weary undertaker who measures days by the weight of names." Voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story, character, or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and vivid, e.g., "carrying the shattered lens like a heart." Clarity and momentum are maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of undertaker, lighthouse lens, and underwater library, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Closure feels inevitable, with the concept of distress signals reweighted into permission.</comment>
