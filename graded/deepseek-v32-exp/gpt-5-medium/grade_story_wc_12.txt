<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Father Ilario's motivation is clear and rooted in his unique role, driving the narrative with micro-choices under pressure. Mara's interiority is embodied through specific imagery like "eyes a longitude no map would claim," and her final choice is earned by prior causality. The husband applies secondary pressure, but his role is minimal yet functional. Contradictory impulses are shown in Mara's struggle, and the resolution forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early with who, where, and when anchored. Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages from Ilario's actions to Mara's liberation. Closure is a decisive change with cost legible in "the possession, nearly complete, found no purchase and evaporated like breath on glass." The dimensional anchor as a persistent constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the chapel as a dimensional anchor pressuring choices. Sensory details like "recorded like frost" and the ultramarine palette are selective and charged. The loop pedal and palette constrain choices and directly shape the final image. Micro-setting elements integrate seamlessly into action and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preventing possession and neighborhood tilting) is signaled early and escalates through Ilario's agency using rhetorical devices. Cost is unmistakable when the whisper evaporates, and escalation is driven by protagonist choices under the causal lens. The final reconfiguration narrows options with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hidden assumptions and grief contracts emerges implicitly through events and images, not statement. Subtext operates in silence and rhetorical devices, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer in Mara's laugh that forgives "nobody and everyone." No moralizing; resonance arises from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct poetic voice, evident in phrases like "muffled clarity." Perceptual signature is consistent, and rhythmic control under pressure is maintained. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure, such as the loop pedal's function.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language like "like a tiny bruise" being purposeful and coherent. No loops or scaffold issues; sentences advance story and atmosphere efficiently. Closure image remains clear and undulled by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of loop pedal priest, dimensional anchor, and rhetorical exorcism, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and method. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the premise is fully committed to.</comment>
