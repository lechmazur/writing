<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in embodied emotion; the borrowed heartbeat and mirror persuasion drive micro-choices under pressure, with earned change in the final image. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the heartbeat's tempo and mirrored possibilities; Accumulative lens holds throughout, with orientation anchored early and cost legible at the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (prism parapet guides entry) and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven into action and perception with vivid specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with singing to mirrors as a key turn that narrows options and reveals cost; stakes are deepened through the interaction with the painter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images (mirrors, heartbeats) without direct statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to possibilities vs. defeat, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic rhythm and perceptual signature; elision is taught and paid off, and dialogue (though brief) carries subtext and advances plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent and supports peak beats, with varied sentence rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of borrowed heartbeat and mirage painting; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and turns feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
