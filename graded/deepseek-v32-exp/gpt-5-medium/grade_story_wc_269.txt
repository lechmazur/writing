<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "my knuckles answered the console"). Final choice to radio the village is earned by prior causality (decoding taps) with visible cost in the temporary path. Contradictory impulses are less emphasized, but micro-choices under pressure reveal values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with pattern-building through rhythms and revelations. Closure is a conceptual repricing (paths are temporal, not erased) with cost legible in the lanterns and corridor's return. Orientation is clear early; persistent constraint (tapping) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective (e.g., "brushed steel key," "slow, forgetful tide"), with sensory details filtered through POV. The station and tapping practice constrain choices and charge the final image (lanterns on poles). Environment pressures tactics and reweights closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding disappearing paths) escalates through protagonist's agency (pressing "Assemble," decoding taps) under accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable in the temporary, breathing corridor. One meaningful tightening (revelation of schedule) forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (adaptation, rhythm of nature) emerges from particulars like tapping and coral bleaching, not statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the corridor image, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control (e.g., "tap tap pause tap"). Voice is poetic and consistent; elision (torn atlas page) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; prose reflects character's mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (e.g., "ribbon pulsed with a rhythm"). Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs; clarity is maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of climate change, memory, and rhythm feels inevitable; specific details (tapping, coral bleaching) transform tropes. Risk-taking in structure and prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Closure arises from established pattern.</comment>
