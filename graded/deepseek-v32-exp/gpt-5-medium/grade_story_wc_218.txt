<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under the terminal diagnosis, with embodied emotion and micro-choices (e.g., grafting branches based on pillar preferences) that earn the final renunciation. Interiority avoids stock phrasing, and the resolution carries visible cost in the quiet completion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the final lines: "silence arrived not as absence but as trust." Cost is legible in the image of returning to the "woven map," and orientation is anchored early without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the living stone pillars and orchard constraining choices (e.g., pillars hum and guide remodeling) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the caretaker's POV without generic clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fostering interspecies respect) escalates under the Accumulative lens through protagonist agency (e.g., copper wire installation and community agreements), with cost legible in the caretaker's fatigue and the orchard's transformation. No coincidental resolutions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions (e.g., otters as "punctuation," pillars "guarding dreams"), offering a resonant, non-literal answer to mortality and connection without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, such as the kelp braiding the shoreline.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature (e.g., "the pillars hummed when I put my ear to their shade"). No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, and diction remains consistent under pressure, enhancing closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent (e.g., "copper sang faintly"), and syntax accelerates with scene needs. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar elements (caretaker, terminal illness) with fresh, non-obvious details (living stone pillars, interspecies respect) that feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
