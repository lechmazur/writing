<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion. The final choice to speak unspoken apologies and change teaching methods is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the reconfigured approach. Contradictory impulses (pruning storms vs. obedience) act in scene, supporting the high score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in the compass hesitating and lace brightening; the accumulative/textural lens holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of regret shapes tactics. Cost is legible in the final image of the sea accepting words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details (salt grass, casuarina branches) filtering through POV. The environment constrains choice (cove directs action) and charges the final image through driftwood and puddles. Micro-setting (compass, lace) alters tactics and deepens theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict over unspoken apologies) escalates under accumulative lens through protagonist agency (following lace instructions, speaking words). Cost is unmistakable in the sea's acceptance and his changed resolve. One meaningful tightening forecloses options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images (lace, compass) without direct statement; subtext operates in implication. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the muted cerulean color and reconfigured teaching, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic, rhythmic control; perceptual signature is strong (e.g., "ocean's tarnished lungs"). No head-hopping; purposeful elision (lace instructions) is taught and paid off at closure. Diction remains within character lexicon under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful. No artifacts obscure causality; sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative pressure. Read-aloud test passes with clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of bonsai tutoring, ghost ship compass, and lace instructions feels inevitable; emotional specificity avoids clichés. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation of familiar tropes through grounded choices supports ingenuity.</comment>
