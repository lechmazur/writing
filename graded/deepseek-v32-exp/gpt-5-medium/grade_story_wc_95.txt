<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's mechanical arm and philosophical stance are integrated into micro-choices under pressure, with contradictory impulses (e.g., "stillness sounded argumentative") acting in scene. Final choice to step into the question is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the closure image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost ("each step erasing the need for an answer"), under a Hybrid lens blending causal decoding and accumulative imagery. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and persistent constraints (sundial, needle) shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting (glass atrium, brook) pressures choices through light reflections and spatial choreography, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, with micro-setting objects (needle card, sundial) constraining decoding actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Hybrid lens, from decoding to fencing, with cost unmistakable in the final step. Dominant stake (finding the door) tightens through meaningful turns, and resolution forecloses paths with visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (e.g., "turn questions into destinations"), with subtext in gesture and image. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing, through the final geometry and departure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic yet precise, and elision (e.g., "hidden overture") is taught and paid off at closure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language purposeful and coherent. Minor density in peak beats (e.g., "dignified chaos" repetition) slightly mutes clarity, but no loops or artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes elements with originality (mechanical arm philosopher, coded sundial), feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure and style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure commits fully to the concept.</comment>
