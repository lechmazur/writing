<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to ground spirits is clear and rooted in embodied actions, such as feeling the needle's hum. Micro-choices under pressure, like climbing the stair and unraveling knots, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of unrest is earned through prior causality, with cost visible in the release of storms. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in the "last sip of storm" and the tide accepting the shore. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres through density of silence and unraveling. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without contradiction. The net and needle as persistent constraints shape tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory specificity, such as "prism sanctuary under starlight" and "moon made ladders on the floor." The environment constrains choices, as the net and needle alter tactics during the unraveling. Recurring objects charge the final image, with the needle and net integral to the closure. Spatial choreography is coherent, with bodies and objects tracking cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grounding spirits escalates under the Accumulative/Textural lens through increased density in unraveling knots and surfacing memories. Protagonist agency drives escalation, with cost legible in the release of storms and change in hush. The tightening forecloses options, as masks ease and spirits find footing. Coincidence is absent; resolution is earned through alteration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence and rest emerges organically from events and images, such as the needle accumulating silence and the net holding breath. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, like the caretaker kissing the locket. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the tide accepting the shore. No moralizing; complexity embraces ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, evident in poetic diction and rhythmic control. Voice modulates with pressure, as in "the hush ring, a bell struck from the inside." Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle; figurative language is coherent and purposeful. Read-aloud test passes with natural flow. Syntax and diction remain consistent and voice-motivated under peak stress.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and non-obvious, synthesizing mask restoration, silence accumulation, and spirit grounding through specific details. Tropes are transformed via grounded choices, like the needle's prismatic sheen. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, with risk-taking in lyric mode heightening stakes. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
