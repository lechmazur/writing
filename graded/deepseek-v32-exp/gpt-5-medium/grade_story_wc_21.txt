<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist's motive is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal values. Interiority is concrete, though minor abstraction in peak beats slightly reduces impact. The final choice to uncover truth is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual repricing as the city learns to read itself, felt cost in the scalding reverie and resolution. Accumulative/textural lens holds strong with pattern-building. Orientation is clear early, and structure coheres without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—floating library, obsidian lagoon—and constrains choices through debris arrangements and lagoon's role. Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered, charging the final image with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering truth escalates through protagonist's agency in arranging debris and parley, under accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the reverie's blistering intensity and the clerk's apology, though mystical elements slightly soften causal tightness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth and memory emerges organically through images and events, with subtext in gestures like the kelp signal. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm control heighten pressure, and elision (e.g., retrocognition) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no major loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though minor overwriting in dense metaphors slightly reduces clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements—zeppelin library, encrypted diary—feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric accumulative design. Specificity in lived detail transforms tropes, and closure reconfigures meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
