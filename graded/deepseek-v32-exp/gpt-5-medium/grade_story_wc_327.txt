<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and micro-choices like offering his travel-name showing cost. The final endurance as caretaker is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the loss of identity. Interiority is concrete, such as feeling the diamond's pulse, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration where the storyteller stays, costing his name, and the language revives. Orientation is clear early with who, where, and when. Causality is tight, with each beat building toward the ending, and cost is legible in the "ringing cavity" left by the curse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with "towers of bone" and echo-tunnel constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, like the pulse against the wall. The environment pressures tactics and evolves consistently, supporting the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of translating the language escalates through protagonist agency, such as harnessing birds and offering his name, with cost legible in the loss. Under accumulative lens, density increases with each step, narrowing options. The curse demand forces a trade-off, deepening the stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of language death and revival emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures like offering names. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the canyon becoming a school, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Complexity in overuse wearing words adds depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature, noticing textures and echoes poetically. Voice is consistently articulate and rhythmic, modulating with pressure. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off, as in the curse as "contract without punctuation."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, e.g., "pulse like patient rain," without muddling peak beats. Sentences advance story and atmosphere with clarity and concision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of familiar tropes, transformed through specific details like using birds' flight patterns for translation. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The ending feels inevitable, with originality in the concept of texture as sound.</comment>
