<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to defeat emotional numbness is clear and rooted in consistent traits; her internal conflict is embodied through micro-choices like feeling the needle's prickle and realizing her own numbness, with an earned change foreclosing her previous path at visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot follows an accumulative/textural drive with coherent causality; closure is a resonant reconfiguration where Mara's insight and planned teaching shift reweight options with felt cost, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the cavern constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details like "smoke, salt, and old rain" are selective and filtered through Mara's POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes of emotional numbness escalate through Mara's agency, such as rigging the drum and using backward songs, tightening options with a legible cost in her realization and the cavern's transformed silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of listening backward to move forward emerges through events and images without direct statement; subtext in gestures like Oko's miming and the final image of "frost admitting it was water" offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mara with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is consistent, and rhythmic control under pressure, as in "the cavern made it larger by making it smaller," enhances clarity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise and lyrical with varied sentence structures; high information density without loops or artifacts, and figurative language like "filament of hush" is coherent and supports pressure in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original concept synthesizes deafness, backward music, and emotional thawing with specificity; risk-taking in lyric design heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
