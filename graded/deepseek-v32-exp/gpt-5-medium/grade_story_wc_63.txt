<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and micro-choices (e.g., using the rake handle for absolution). Interior contradiction is shown in guilt over past precision, and the final choice to share the tool is earned by prior causality. Blind spots drive mistakes, and the change feels credible with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (shared balance restored). Orientation is clear early; the pause in the pendulum's swing serves as a decisive moment with felt cost (e.g., "the world shivers"). Structure is coherent with one meaningful tightening, and the ending reweights prior material without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (tidal obsidian ridge, clock tower) is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered (e.g., "black glass breathes with the moon"). Spatial choreography is clear, and the ridge actively influences tactics and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring shared balance) escalates under accumulative lens through protagonist agency (stopping the pendulum, using inscriptions). Cost is legible in the pause and interactions (e.g., "forgiving the distance between neighbors"). One meaningful deepening occurs, narrowing options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of balance and absolution emerges through particulars (rake handle, pendulum) without direct statement. Subtext operates in gestures and images (e.g., offering the handle). Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic yet consistent, and elision (e.g., memories) is taught and pays off. No head-hopping; dialogue, when present, is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (e.g., "plank of silence laid across the century"). Minor overwriting in peaks doesn't obscure clarity, and closure remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of clock winding and absolution feels inevitable, with risk-taking in poetic prose that heightens stakes. Specific details (rake handle, tidal ridge) avoid templates, and the closure transforms familiar concepts through character choice.</comment>
