<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motive to understand emotion through printing is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and earned change in using ambiguity to disorient fear. Borrowing personalities trait is consistently shown through micro-choices, though some abstraction in peak beats slightly limits contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with coherent closure as charged poise: protagonist's realization reconfigures ambiguity's purpose, cost legible in "absence washes my hands cleaner." Orientation anchored early, pattern taught through recurring imagery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details (oil, citrus, topaz dust) that constrain choices; micro-setting like halo fragment and press charge the final image, altering tactics and deepening atmosphere throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes in understanding emotion escalate through agency-driven beats (e.g., printing for grieving couple, self-confession), with cost visible in final trade-off between cruelty and mercy. Pressure tightens under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of empathy and ambiguity emerges through concrete images like "forgiveness is a rotating mirror," offering resonant non-literal resolution without moralizing. Subtext operates in silences and implications.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; poetic voice remains consistent under pressure, purposeful elision taught and paid off in closure. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without major artifacts. Minor figurative density in peaks (e.g., "mathematics of emotion") is pattern-taught and clear, though not flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of letterpress mysticism and emotional arithmetic feels inevitable; specific details transform tropes, with risk-taking in structure and theme heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
