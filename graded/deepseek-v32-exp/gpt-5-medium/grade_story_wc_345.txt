<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Collective POV effectively conveys shared motivation and interiority; micro-choices under pressure, such as the rescue orchestration, reveal embodied emotion and earned change. Lio's consistency and the community's flawed hope create credible stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure via resonant reconfiguration (nebula reveal) lands with cost in collective effort. Orientation is clear early, and causality remains intact through Lio's guidance and environmental pressures.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (e.g., arch accident) and charges the final image; sensory details like "mist rained down" are purposeful and woven through action, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes of survival and hope escalate through the arch crisis, driven by collective agency; cost is legible in the rescue's physical and emotional toll, aligning with the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Themes of trust and community emerge organically through images (bell, chalk) without moralizing; the ending's nebula light offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior struggles.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person plural voice is distinct and stable, with poetic rhythm and perceptual signature; no head-hopping, and elision (e.g., Lio's origins) serves closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "hope here is brambled" enhances clarity and propulsion in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost-guided community on a fantastical planet feels inevitable; risk-taking in collective POV and lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
