<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prince's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative from his vow to reawaken beauty to his final caretaking. Interiority is concrete and embodied, such as his "heart a metronome of quaking reverie," and his change from conquest to repair is earned through on-page actions like assembling the cradle. Contradictory impulses are shown in his rejection of tutors' teachings for a gentler path, with micro-choices under pressure revealing his values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the egg hatches, reconfiguring the world with cost legible in "gears learned to hesitate" and people remembering lullabies. The causal lens holds tightly from the prince's actions to the outcome, and orientation is clear early. The flawed genesis concept persists as a constraint, shaping tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the suspended palace and mechanical world pressuring choices, such as the palace's sway influencing the cradle's design. Sensory details like "hummed like a hive" and "cold light" are filtered through the prince's POV, and the egg as a recurring object charges the closure by constraining actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the causal lens through the prince's agency, from hypothesizing to assembling the cradle, leading to the hatching with cost seen in engineers weeping and mills idling. The dominant stake of reawakening beauty is tested and deepened, with a visible price in the world's transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the egg symbolizing repair and the final concept that "the first bruise could be bandaged." Subtext operates through lyrical implication, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with a stable single POV and perceptual signature evident in phrases like "bitterly sweet, like forgiveness for a storm." Rhythmic control under pressure is maintained, and any elision is purposeful, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, as in "feathered with light the color of old brass," and propulsion is clear, advancing story and atmosphere seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh specificity, transforming the prince archetype into a caretaker and using the egg as a unique catalyst. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable from established pattern and character choice.</comment>
