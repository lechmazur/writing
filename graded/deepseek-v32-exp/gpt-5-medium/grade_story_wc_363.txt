<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kio's motivation to send a message is clear and rooted in consistent traits, compelling high-stakes choices like thinning herself. Interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., "she must thin herself" showing sacrifice. Micro-choices under pressure, such as weaving with puzzle edges, reveal hierarchy of values. Final endurance is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in "the debt was paid in quiet." Orientation is clear early with who, where, when. Structure coheres through imagery buildup, and the persistent constraint of the dead river shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices like using bamboo fiber and puzzle edges. Sensory details are selective, e.g., "bamboo forest" and "loom" charge the final image. Environment mirrors internal states through action, such as the orchard's hush reflecting Kio's stillness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sending the message) escalates under accumulative lens through Kio's agency, e.g., weaving actions that narrow options. Cost is unmistakable in "latent sacrifice" and "thinning herself." Pressure tightens with each pass of the shuttle, foreclosing paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through motifs like silence and memory, with subtext in gestures (e.g., amber bead as witness). Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material. Emotional aftereffect is concrete through images like "fabric of memories."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "measured possibilities by the tremor of leaves." Voice is poetic and controlled under pressure, with purposeful compression. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, e.g., "the wind crossed, it sounded like cloth thinking." No loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and clear. Propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and closure image is undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis feels inevitable, with unique elements like loom spinning and puzzle edges transforming familiar tropes. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details (e.g., amber bead fossilizing a gnat) create freshness.</comment>
