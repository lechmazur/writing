<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's grief is embodied through concrete actions like polishing metal that clouds, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., using the stencil to help others) revealing a hierarchy of values. The shift from jeweler to "tutor of endings" is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in enduring work. Interiority avoids stock phrasing, and emotional progression is realistic, layering contradiction without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, building through images and reflections to a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) at closure. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible in the final image of the glowing lily. The structure is coherent, with one meaningful deepening that reweights stakes, and no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image—the observatory's dome and mechanism pressure the protagonist's actions, such as projecting the stencil. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "light found dust like a river finds silt"), filtered through POV bias. The environment evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal grief) escalates through accumulative depth, driven by protagonist agency in helping others, which reweights options. Cost is legible on-page in the enduring work and the mother's scene. Pressure coheres under the lens, with one meaningful tightening that forecloses paths, avoiding coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of grief and intention emerges through particulars like the lily stencil and curtains, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("to illuminate what refuses itself") that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and image, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in rhythmic control and selective attention (e.g., "metal remembers being rock"). Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction remains within the narrator's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythm and no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and purpose-driven, even in peak beats. Minor overwriting is present but does not harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mourning jewelry, observatory, and grief feels inevitable, with risk-taking in accumulative structure heightening stakes. Details are particular and transformative, avoiding tropes. The core premise is fresh, and emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
