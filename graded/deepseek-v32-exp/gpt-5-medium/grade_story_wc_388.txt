<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the investigation with micro-choices under pressure, such as reassembling letters and teaching tuning. Interiority is concrete, embodied in observations like "I did not intuit magic; I intuited design." The final choice to refuse the diamond is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in "no richer, but steadier."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the protagonist trades "a curse for a calibration," felt cost is legible in the final lines. Causal lens holds throughout with because/therefore linkages from investigation to resolution. Orientation is clear early, and the diamond's flaw persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "radioactive dust storms" and "fruit like stubborn lanterns," constraining choices as the diamond's frequency shepherds dust. The packing shed as micro-setting charges the final image, integrating environment with action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth vs. superstition escalates through protagonist agency, from observing the calm to uncovering the resonator's function. Cost is unmistakable in the trade-off at closure, and pressure tightens meaningfully under the causal lens with no coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of truth and imperfection emerges organically from events, with subtext in images like the flawed diamond as "signature of every useful thing." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through "traded a curse for a calibration," avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in precise observations like "a timbre as precise as glass cooling." Voice remains consistent under pressure, and any elision (e.g., shredded letters) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with vivid imagery like "storm came like a herd of hammers" advancing story without loops or scaffold. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, and figurative language is coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting with scientific debunking, transforming tropes through specific details like the diamond as a field resonator. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes, and the premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
