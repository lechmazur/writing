<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to understand time's texture is clear and consistent, embodied in sensory choices like "charting pulses by smell." Interiority is concrete, and the rediscovery of childhood memory earns a meaningful change with visible cost in the heart "listening instead." No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration as the capsule opening and memory recall recharge time's meaning with cost in the misplaced pulse. Orientation is anchored early, and causality builds through sensory patterns without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Emerald silo and urn fragment constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details like "glowed like bottled pasture" are selective and purposeful. Micro-setting pressures tactics, and spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake in understanding time escalates under accumulative lens through protagonist's agency in embedding messages and opening the capsule. Cost is legible in the heart's shift and rediscovery, but escalation is subtle rather than sharply tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of time and memory emerges organically from images like walking the letter, with subtext in gestures. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in "waiting tasted like cedar," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature in "charting pulses by smell" and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift; dialogue is minimal but natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density, zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear, e.g., "heart stopped clicking and began listening," and syntax varies purposefully without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise of numbers changing meaning is fresh and transformed through specific sensory details; emotional truth in rediscovery feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
