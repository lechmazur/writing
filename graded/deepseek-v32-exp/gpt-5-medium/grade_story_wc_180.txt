<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictions like being "bad with goodbyes" driving micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation (leaving the tin unopened) is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the quartz throbbing and the daughter's absence. Mira's feistiness applies immediate pressure, deepening the relational crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong, with pattern density increasing through vows and repair imagery. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis with the father waiting) where cost is legible in "vows letting go the way grief sometimes does." Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens coheres through the ending's rustle and breath.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image: the cathedral orchard pressures the ritual, and the rafters "remembered their orchard" in closure. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, like "peaches and pears and a small ache of neglect," avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, escalation is a density increase in vow-shedding and repair, driven by protagonist agency in the ritual. Cost is unmistakable in "fruit lifted its shoulders" and the father's clenched fist over the ribbon, reweighting stakes with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of generational wisdom emerges through particulars like the ribbon graft and "deciduous vows," not statement. The ending offers a non-literal answer in "accidental wisdom," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like Mira shoving the narrator.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV has a distinct perceptual signature ("quartz-eye mender" filtering stress lines) and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (Mira's questions advance plot), with no head-hopping. Elision (e.g., the quarrel backstory) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language ("branches arched like ribs") is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, supporting the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of deciduous vows with personal repair feels inevitable, heightening stakes without gimmickry. The quartz-eye mechanic and cathedral orchard offer a fresh angle, transformed through specific choices like the ribbon graft. Risk-taking in lyric style pays off in closure.</comment>
