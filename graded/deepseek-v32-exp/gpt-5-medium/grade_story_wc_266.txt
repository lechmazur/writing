<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to find unused courage is clear and intensifies under pressure, with concrete interiority and embodied emotions. Micro-choices, like reaching for courage, reveal values with visible cost. Guides apply secondary pressure, though they lean archetypal, but this doesn't undermine closure. Final renunciation is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with pattern-building imagery leading to a resonant reconfiguration closure. Orientation is clear within 120 words. Cost is legible in the final image of the skiff nesting inside the chest, foreclosing paths with felt emotional price. Structure is cohesive with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (e.g., "fog gathers like quiet linen") are purposefully filtered through POV, creating atmosphere that constrains choices. The veiled ridgeway and skiff environment charge the final image, altering tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent, with setting evolving consistently.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding courage escalates under accumulative lens through density increases and protagonist's agency in traversing the ridge. Cost is unmistakable in the reaching moment, narrowing options. Guides' interactions deepen pressure, with one meaningful tightening that reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of courage emerges organically through images and events, not statement, with subtext in gestures like the star stamp. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material. Emotional aftereffect lingers through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with distinct perceptual signature and lyrical rhythm control under pressure. Voice is consistent and character-specific, with purposeful elision taught early. Dialogue is minimal but natural, carrying subtext. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language coherent and purposeful in peak beats. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts obscuring closure. Sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative build, and final image resonates with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of inner journey tropes through specific, grounded choices like the ferry guides and ticket punch. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation feels inevitable in hindsight, with bold choices that cohere into a singular artistic stance.</comment>
