<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in personal history, with embodied emotion (e.g., "cold made my palms intelligent") and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation of forgiveness for the wheel is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the weight of truth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in "carried the memory of the weight." Inferred accumulative/textural lens holds, with pattern of ghost shift and valve wheel tightening meaning. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting pressures choices (tunnel and valve wheel constrain actions) and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, e.g., "cold dripped from the arch in slow beads," filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens, with turning the valve wheel narrowing options and increasing pressure. Cost is legible in "weight arrived in my arms" and the unknotting sigh.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth and forgiveness emerges through events and images without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via forgiving the wheel, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "religiously skeptical," tool-focused lexicon). Voice remains coherent under pressure, and any elision (e.g., radio calls) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent (e.g., "droplets quivered like verdicts"), and sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost shift, valve wheel, and personal history feels inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure reconfigures meaning.</comment>
