<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion in micro-choices like testing names with the scale. Final endurance is earned by prior causality, and internal contradictions (e.g., "luminous regret" vs. stubborn calibration) act in scene. No diagnostic label-speak; flaws complicate choices credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in "I am not healed, but I am held together." Accumulative/textural lens holds, building through imagery and reflection to reconfigure redemption. Orientation is clear by ~120 words with "rain-washed foundry" and context. Persistent constraint of balance shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is integral, with the foundry, rain, and objects (assay cup, coin) constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, e.g., "steamed like a wounded animal," reflecting POV bias. Spatial choreography is coherent, and environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens, from testing names to fusing the coin, with cost visible in emotional and physical processes. Dominant stake (redemption) tightens through deepening choices, foreclosing options. No coincidence; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like kintsugi and zodiac coin, offering a non-literal answer through "measured remembrance." Subtext operates in gesture and image, avoiding moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete, and complexity resists tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "factually mystical." Voice is lyrical and consistent, with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off. Diction matches the alchemist's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and supports closure, e.g., "constellations forgotten by noon." No register drift or template cadence; sentence-level propulsion is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of alchemy, grief, and kintsugi feels inevitable, with specific details elevating familiarity. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Turns are earned through character choice, and transformation test passes with unique voice and setting.</comment>
