<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as "hands were operatively gentle." Micro-choices under pressure, like letting arguments ride the wind, reveal hierarchy of values. Final choice to use ritual and shared work is earned with visible cost in the bowl of casings.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with war loosening its grip, cost legible in the bowl of casings and provisional agreements. Orientation is clear early; structure coheres through ritual density without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (ancient terrace, celestial bodies) pressures choices and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, like "banners of rival cities lifted and sighed." Micro-setting (ebony clipboard, bowl of casings) constrains actions and reweights meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of peace through ritual escalates under Accumulative lens via protagonist agency, such as responding to the old soldier's question. Cost is unmistakable in shared work and the bowl of casings, narrowing options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of redemption through shared work emerges from events and images, not statement; subtext operates in ritual and symbols. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the bowl and promises.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, modulating with pressure. Dialogue natural and goal-driven; no head-hopping; elision taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "ritual gathered us like tide gathers kelp." Read-aloud test passes with clear propulsion in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of peace negotiation through ritual and gentleness; specific details like ebony clipboard and bowl of casings feel inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; transforms familiar tropes.</comment>
