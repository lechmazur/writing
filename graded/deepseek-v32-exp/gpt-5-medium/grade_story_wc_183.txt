<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's internal conflict between discoverer and person is embodied and drives choices, with micro-choices like holding the jar revealing hierarchy of values. Final unclasping earns credibility through prior causality, though some abstraction in "chimera twin" concept slightly distances emotional immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong; closure lands with Conceptual Repricing as narrator's identity shift ("one hand letting go of the ledger") carries felt cost of forgetting. Orientation is clear early, and the emerald card's role tightens options coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the ship's corridors adjusting like a "host setting a table" constraining choices, and the emerald card charging the final image by mapping constellations. Sensory details (salt-furred prizes, fog as moths) are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens is driven by narrator's agency—using the card, following horses—tightening stakes toward the cost of speaking names. Dominant stake (finding garden) deepens with visible price, though the "unkindled solace" payoff feels slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and identity emerges through particulars like the jar of soil and the garden's "leaves etched with trembling names," resisting moralizing. Ending's non-literal answer ("leaves shook and spelt nothing") reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person POV has a distinct perceptual signature, with poetic compression ("the ship exhaled like a sleeping animal") and consistent diction. Dialogue with the "not-mine voice" carries subtext without head-hopping, though minor register drift in peak beats occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density, but slight overwriting in metaphors like "trapped freedom, a key that would not fit any lock" creates minor coherence issues. No major artifacts obscure closure, and sentence-level propulsion supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of carnival surrealism and memory exploration feels inevitable, with specific details like the emerald swatch card transforming familiar tropes. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure reconfigures meaning boldly.</comment>
