<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as walking backwards when nervous. Interiority is concrete, and the final stance against the council is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in trembling. The child's return shows credible growth, and relationships serve as crucibles without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (earned stasis) under the accumulative/textural lens, with cost legible in the archivist's trembling and the council's reluctant faith. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity, with the shadow corridor and tea leaves reinforcing the pattern. No causality breaks; the ending reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The library setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like dust instructing light and floorboards testing retreat. Specificity is purposeful, woven through action, and the courtyard window and tea leaves act as micro-settings that alter tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with the council's decree tightening stakes and the archivist's response forcing a trade-off. Cost is legible in the child's resolve and the archivist's trembling, narrowing options meaningfully. The dominant stake of memory vs. forgetting is signaled early and deepens through the trial, with no coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images like reversible exile and shard-mirrors, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and gesture, such as the child reading tea leaves, and the ending reweights prior material with complexity. Emotional aftereffect is concrete, avoiding sentimentality through embodied cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic syntax and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is consistent, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural when present. Elision is taught and paid off, as in the swing's metronome imagery, enhancing clarity without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language like "long bottle of dusk" serving purpose without muddle. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; sentences advance story and atmosphere cohesively. Line-level craft is flawless, with strong verbs and concrete nouns, and closure image is undulled by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of memory archiving and reversible exile, with specific details like tea leaf geometry transforming tropes. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the concept feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, and the premise is fully committed to without derivative echoes.</comment>
