<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation for self-forgiveness is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion in micro-choices like kneeling without despair. The final renunciation at the river is earned by prior causality, showing credible endurance with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in the river realization, under a coherent accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the graffiti-to-river progression tightens meaningfully. Persistent constraint of the river's nature shapes tactics, and cost is legible in "I would stop asking it to be me."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with the station as a "green chapel" and river culvert guiding the climax. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as ivy "shimmering like soundproofing." Micro-setting elements like graffiti and accordion actively pressure decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, following graffiti instructions to confront the river, with cost legible in the emotional weight of the shallow. Dominant stake of self-forgiveness tightens through a meaningful deepening that forecloses prior paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the river's truth and graffiti wisdom, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in images like the "little blue mouth" and final river acceptance, reweighting prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV has a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control, with voice consistent under pressure. Purposeful compression in lyric mode is taught and paid off, and elision (e.g., graffiti clues) enhances clarity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, as in "ivy veins an entry," and sentence-level propulsion accelerates toward closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of river chronicler, graffiti cartography, and accordion motifs feels inevitable, with risk-taking in accumulative structure heightening stakes. Specific details like patched bellows and mossed milestones avoid template plots, transforming familiar tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
