<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's patience and motivation are consistently embodied; micro-choices under pressure, like coaxing knots, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final preservation of methods feels earned through prior causality, though internal contradiction is minimal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration where decoding knots reweights knowledge with cost in attention and effort. Orientation is clear early, and the ending image of the harbor keeping watch charges the poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image; the golden dock, snow, and fog are woven into action, with sensory details like "frosted veil" and "ticking dock" reflecting POV bias. The rope and fulgurite glass function as micro-settings that alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes in preserving methods escalate through protagonist's agency in decoding knots, each revealing a lesson with cost (e.g., mercy in frayed ends). Under accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, narrowing options without external antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of patience and preservation emerges through particulars like knot decoding and seed handling; ending offers a non-literal answer in the harbor's continuity, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext in knots and weavers enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV has a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, reflective—with stable distance and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful elision in weavers' communication is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and vivid imagery without loops or scaffolds; sentences advance story and atmosphere, e.g., "rope remembers." Rhythm varies naturally, though some complex sentences risk slight density, but clarity is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of seed collecting, knot decoding, and secret weavers feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet, accumulative plot heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details like fulgurite glass and clay amphorae anchor freshness.</comment>
