<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Oris's motivation to welcome nuance into certainty is concretely embodied in micro-choices like threading the ampoule, with internal conflict between certainty and delay dramatized under pressure. The final renunciation of brute certainty is earned by prior causality, and the scholar's recoil provides secondary pressure. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are filtered through stone and water imagery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the scholar's certainty reopens with nuance, cost legible in "she felt the delay in her bones." Causal lens holds tightly from revelation to threading, with structural weakness enabling the decisive act. Orientation is anchored within 120 words via "I am Oris, the living statue... underwater city garden."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The underwater garden constrains choice (telepathy travels through water, structural weakness enables threading) and charges the final image of "benches for arguments." Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, e.g., "anemones wrote their astonishment in bubbles." Spatial choreography is coherent in Oris's movement through the dome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certainty vs. nuance) escalates under causal lens through Oris's agency in threading the ampoule, narrowing options and forcing the scholar's stance change. Cost is unmistakable in "waiting longer than certainty likes," with revelations deepening knowledge. No coincidence; pressure tightens via protagonist-driven action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the ampoule's redefinition from toxin to tempo, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to certainty vs. nuance without moralizing. Subtext operates in images like "listening wound" and "benches for arguments." The final reconfiguration ("depth without fear") arises from concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature (noticing through water currents and stone). Voice is lyrical yet precise, modulating under pressure without head-hopping. Telepathic dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit. Elision (e.g., "cascading revelations") is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, e.g., "silt rose like breath from stone lungs." No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Syntax varies purposefully, and register remains consistent with Oris's voice. Read-aloud ear test passes seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes living statue telepathy and underwater city with non-obvious depth, transforming tropes through specific moral calculus (hesitation as incisive kindness). Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight, e.g., "structural weakness" enabling revelation.</comment>
