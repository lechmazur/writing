<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with embodied emotions under pressure. The final choice to refuse the committee chair is earned by prior causality, showing visible cost in foregone power. Micro-choices, like interfering with the signal, reveal a hierarchy of values aligned with "cautiously hopeful" traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the protagonist chooses breakfast without the chair, reconfiguring options with felt cost under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and the plot escalates through because/therefore linkages from signal discovery to interference. The persistent constraint of the signal shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through POV, with sensory details like "mixer lights like stars" and "cables hummed like throat singing" that pressure choices. The radio station and charts constrain actions and charge the final image, integrating environment into the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from detecting the signal to broadcasting countersigns, narrowing options with cost legible in societal unscripting. Dominant stake of influence versus autonomy tightens meaningfully, and the resolution is earned through active interference.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and imagery, such as the signal as trickster, with the ending offering a non-literal answer ("teach people their breath") that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the dean's refusal and the wave's smirk, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is consistent and lyrical, with purposeful compression in lines like "Hiss became breath, breath became friction," and elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied syntax, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, though minor density in peak beats like "vision of victory like sugar into water" slightly risks overwriting without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of celestial signals with societal manipulation, transformed through specific details like subsonic countersigns. Risk-taking in style and concept heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight with bold choices.</comment>
