<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation of mere safety for active connection is earned, though slight passivity in observation reduces impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost as lovers reunite through shared sentences. Orientation is immediate, and the thread motif pays off in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as threads tied to willow poles altering tactics. Sensory details are selective and charged in the closure, with the lotus temple acting as a micro-setting that pressures the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist's agency in designing the installation, narrowing options for the lovers. Cost is legible in their emotional vulnerability, though stakes remain internal without external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of connection emerges through particulars like the thrush's nest and paper leaves, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and implication, enriching the closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and rhythmic control under pressure. Minimal dialogue is natural, and elision is purposeful, though slight overwriting in peaks causes minor register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no major artifacts. Figurative language is coherent, but minor overwriting in descriptive passages slightly dulls momentum without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing ghostwriting and public art into a non-obvious whole. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable from established patterns.</comment>
