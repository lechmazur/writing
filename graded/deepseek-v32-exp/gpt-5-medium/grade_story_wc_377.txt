<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Iri's characterization is deeply embodied with consistent traits and motives; her seasonal muteness and devotion to preserving wonder drive key choices, such as using the kinetic sculptures to answer the Keepers. Internal conflict is shown through her fear of truth hardening versus their fear of dissolution, culminating in an earned renunciation. The trembling hands moment concretizes the cost of guarding delight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the Keepers depart transformed, reaffirming Iri's purpose with felt cost in their slowness and her vigilance. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through imagery and pattern shifts. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the iceberg fragment's role charges the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices: the bluff's isolation and the iceberg fragment constrain Iri's methods and charge the final image. Sensory details like "powdered ice" on bell lips are purposeful, filtered through her POV, and the environment shapes tactics during the Keepers' visit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes of wonder vs. institutional truth escalate through Iri's agency in repositioning the iceberg fragment, leading to a deepening that changes the Keepers' knowledge. Cost is legible in their wept tears and fallen hands, under the accumulative lens. No coincidental resolution; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as music as weather replacing words, offering a non-literal answer to central questions of truth and wonder. Subtext operates in gestures like the Keepers' bowed departure, avoiding moralizing. The final image reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and third-person limited to Iri, with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, rhythmic prose that modulates under pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., "after words became unnecessary") is taught and pays off at closure. Voice remains coherent through peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "whispered like a sleeping throat" is consistent and purposeful, though slightly mixed, it doesn't muddle clarity. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive, and closure is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality lies in a fresh synthesis of the mute sage trope with kinetic sculpture and resonance-based counsel, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting.</comment>
