<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is deeply rooted in ambiguous loss, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion; final realization of coherence is earned through prior causality with visible cost, as seen in "he understands that vision is a ledger where debt and gift mislabel each other."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual repricing under accumulative/textural lens, cost legible in the final image of carrying an unsolved theorem; orientation is clear early, and structure is coherent in a single scene with meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image, with sensory details like "dripping stalactites" and "fruit glistening like cooled tears" integrated into action; environment shapes tactics and reinforces theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens, with cost unmistakable in the realization of longing as a variable; stakes tighten through rituals and reflections, foreclosing options with felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to loss through the mosaic's "cracked theorem"; subtext operates in gesture and silence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice exhibits distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, with stable POV and purposeful elision; poetic diction remains consistent and heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, as in "like two boats lit by the same distant fire," advancing momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes familiar grief concepts with fresh, non-obvious angle through specific imagery and risk-taking in structure; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight, enhancing stakes.</comment>
