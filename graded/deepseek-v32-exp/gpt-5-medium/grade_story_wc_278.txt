<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's guilt and motivation are deeply embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., tattooing himself) earning the final stance change. Interior contradiction is vivid, as seen in "I pretend the stars I prick are maps forward, but I am here to hush the dissonance of old guilt." The resolution forecloses a path with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the final tattoo and whisper "thank you," under an accumulative/textural lens. The lens holds without ambiguity, and orientation is clear early. Letters and recorder create coherent causality, with cost legible in "the map on my arm points inward, and in that direction the sound thins."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting ("laboratory of lost sounds") and objects (amber, recorder) constrain choices and charge the final image, as when the amber shifts the cry's key. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, with economy. The amber's recurrence as a micro-setting meets the 9+ test by influencing tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency, such as using the recorder and tattooing, reweighting stakes with cost. The dominant stake (internal guilt) tightens through density increases, and the final choice to stay pays a visible price. Agency is clear in beats like drawing the glyph, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of guilt and listening emerges through particulars like the amber and letters, with subtext in gestures (e.g., "keep the past that keeps you still"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, as in the final image of the map pointing inward. Earned wisdom arises from concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic yet coherent, with purposeful elision (e.g., "meteor hush") taught and paid off. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural when present, advancing plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and supports pressure, as in "dusk that unspools like tape." Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, synthesizing tattooist, lost sounds, and guilt into a non-obvious whole. Risk-taking in surreal elements (haunted firmware) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation of tropes through specific details, like the amber's choice metaphor, feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
