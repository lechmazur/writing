<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's prosopagnosia is deeply integrated, driving methodical investigation and embodied perception; micro-choices under pressure, such as reasoning from the blue ribbon, reveal consistent motivation and internal conflict. The final painting decision forecloses a path with felt cost, earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with closure as Conceptual Repricing via the painting reconfiguring absence and empathy; orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the letter's revelation. Structure coheres with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quarry setting constrains choices (e.g., lancing silt) and charges the final image with mist and ribbon; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes in uncovering Mara's fate escalate through protagonist's agency (lancing, reasoning), tightening under accumulative lens; cost is visible in the painting's emotional resolution and the traded ribbon's implication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Themes of absence and empathy emerge through particulars like the ribbon and painting, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext in the final letter deepens complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice ("Cold cases are the rooms where echoes go to practice speech"); perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., evidence disappearance) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats like the quarry investigation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of face-blind artist and cold case feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors universals like empathy.</comment>
