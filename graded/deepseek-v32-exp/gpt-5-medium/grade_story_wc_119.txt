<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to "transpose life into a new key" is clear and drives choices; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "the envelope sweating against my ribs"). Micro-choices under pressure, like collaborating with the keeper, reveal values, though the prophetic trait feels slightly abstract at times.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing as the lighthouse projection reweights open secrets with cost ("open secrets are waiting rooms where fear goes quiet"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong through pattern density; orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting vividly pressures choices—the lighthouse constrains tactics and charges the climax; sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "lens grumbles in its sleep"); environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism, integrating seamlessly with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, from receiving specs to projecting the message; cost is legible in the town's acknowledgment and the agent's blank microdot; stakes tighten meaningfully, though the social cost is subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of "arrangement over insight" emerges organically from events and images; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("I had not changed the town with insight, only with arrangement"); subtext operates through implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and rhythmic, modulating under pressure; dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision (e.g., "open secrets") is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety; sentences advance story without loops or scaffold; minor overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "neon fizzed out like a tired constellation") does not harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fortune cookie writer, spycraft, and lighthouse feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; specific details anchor universals, transforming familiar concepts.</comment>
