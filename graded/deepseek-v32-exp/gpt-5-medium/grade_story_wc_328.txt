<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to become a keeper is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the metamorphosis. Minor hairline slip in occasional abstract phrasing, but closure choice is compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds strong, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (metamorphosis) that lands on-page with felt cost. Orientation is clear early, and the lens coheres without contradiction. The arrowhead's cracking and sprouting root provide a decisive change with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospherically dense, with sensory details filtered through POV. The garden constrains choices (e.g., drain breathing alters tactics) and charges the final image. Bulbs' gravitational play and roots' whispering integrate seamlessly into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (altered returns), and escalation is driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens, such as planting the arrowhead. Cost is legible in the metamorphosis and acceptance of keeper role. One meaningful tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of metamorphosing bitterness emerges organically through images and events, with subtext in gestures like the herbalist's smile. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The cosmic joke concept is integrated without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that reflects the researcher's expertise. Prose rhythm and diction are controlled under pressure, and any elision (e.g., phone calls) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density, advancing story and atmosphere. No significant loops or scaffold issues; figurative language is coherent and purposeful. Minor overwriting in peaks (e.g., "gravel weep backward") but clarity remains.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, synthesizing cryptid research with metaphysical elements in a fresh, non-obvious way. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the arrowhead's evolution. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
