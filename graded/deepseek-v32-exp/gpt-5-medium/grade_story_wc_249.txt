<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final choice to carry the donors' echoes is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the shared awakening. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with felt cost in the "agreed awakening" and the promise to honor the donors. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the sound pattern teaching the payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (sound wave garden) constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory detail purposeful and filtered through POV. The auric lagoon and resonance beds are integral to tactics, and spatial choreography is coherent, enhancing the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with drumming and intention tuning the garden to narrow options. Cost is legible in the treatment's "teeth" and the acceptance of donors' memories, forcing a trade-off that deepens stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of entanglement as love emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in the bridge and lagoon. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through "learning its music," avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic yet consistent, with elision (e.g., "hush of the universe") taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping, and diction matches the focalizer's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language coherent and purposeful. No loops or scaffold artifacts; sentences advance story and atmosphere, and closure image is clear without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes experimental treatment with sound-based communication in a fresh, non-obvious way. Specific details (e.g., whales writing letters) and risk-taking in lyric style heighten stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
