<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; internal conflict between inaction and promise-keeping is embodied in micro-choices like entering the cave. Final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost when leaving the painting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the protagonist leaves the painting, with cost legible in "I want to stay, but keeping the promise means not living in the painting." Orientation is clear early, and wrong turn deepens stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details like "brine and old smoke" filtering through POV; the cave network and painted shell constrain choices and charge the final image, supporting the thematic arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (keeping the promise) escalates through agency under Accumulative lens, such as choosing paths and adding a brushstroke; cost is unmistakable when foregoing permanence in the painting, tightening options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of self-promise and authenticity emerges through images like the cracked mirror and shell, without moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in painting the harbor's breath, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical with a perceptual signature (e.g., "salt ghosts," "mineral syllables"); POV is stable and first-person, with rhythmic control under pressure and purposeful elision that pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats like the oasis revelation, maintaining clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of artist's journey feels inevitable, with specific details like the painted shell transforming tropes; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, supporting closure.</comment>
