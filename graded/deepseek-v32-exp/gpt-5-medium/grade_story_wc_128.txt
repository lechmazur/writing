<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot from her initial cautious exuberance to initiating the Harbor Ledger. Interiority is concrete, such as her embodied emotion in "cautious exuberance thrums in her," and micro-choices under pressure reveal her values. Jun's whimsical attentiveness is shown through actions like aligning maps with the breeze, and their relationship forces choices that alter the town's spirit, with the final shared commitment earning its cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mara and Jun promise to keep listening, reconfiguring the harbor's music with felt cost in their shared custody. The Causal lens holds tightly from the envelope discovery to the Ledger's success, with orientation anchored early. Persistent constraints like the locket and symphony timeframe shape tactics, and cost is legible in the final image of kindness circling back.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the "breezy library under stars" and harbor details filtering through Mara's POV to guide choices, such as Jun opening late post-symphony. The locket object constrains the investigation and charges the final image when hung beside names. Sensory selection reflects urgency, like "gulls gossip about human schedules," avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uplifting silent contributors escalates under the Causal lens through Mara and Jun's agency, from tracing the locket to hosting the community event. Cost is unmistakable in their shared effort and the Ledger's impact, narrowing options as recognition risks are overcome. One meaningful tightening occurs when they find Hideo's name, forcing a trade-off that deepens the stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of cycles of compassion emerges organically through particulars like the locket's story and forgiven demurrage, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the tide metaphor, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures, such as Jun's tide-smile, and the final image invites reflection without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is primarily Mara's with stable third-person distance, though minor shifts to Jun's perspective at breaks are legible and coherent. Voice has a distinct lyrical texture, like "pages breathe calmer," with rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in Jun's query about the letter, but slight convergence in poetic tone prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere, such as "the sea writes punctuation on the pilings." No loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity. Momentum is maintained through concise, image-driven lines, and the final paragraph lands with charged specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes cargo brokerage and librarianship into a fresh, non-obvious angle on community compassion, with specifics like violin tuning at docks. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, and the ending feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
