<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in past trauma; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion. Final choice to create the garland is earned by prior causality and micro-choices, with visible cost in renouncing fire. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as memory of brother contrasting with present patience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost—the emotional weight of brother's absence and village's weariness. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with sea glass as persistent constraint shaping tactics. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the final image of the garland calming the grotto.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the grotto and sea glass constraining choices and charging the final image. Micro-setting (sea glass) alters tactics through polishing process. Details are filtered through POV, integrating action and atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sharing light without harm) escalates under Accumulative lens through density increase in the polishing and stringing beats. Protagonist agency drives escalation, with cost legible in villagers' unclenched hands and children's reflections. One meaningful tightening forecloses the option of fire with visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of patience vs. quickness emerges through events and images, not statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the garland as a "gentle compass." Subtext operates in memory and implication, with earned wisdom from particulars. No moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and lyrical rhythm. Voice is character-specific, with purposeful compression and elision taught early. No head-hopping; diction remains within POV's lexicon, and psychic distance shifts intentionally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and supports pressure, with no muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion is clear, and closure image is undulled by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar themes (light vs. fire) through specific details like sea glass polishing. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth in sibling dynamic feels inevitable in hindsight, with no derivative premise.</comment>
