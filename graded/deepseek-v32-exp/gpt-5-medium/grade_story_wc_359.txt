<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bell ringer's synesthetic traits and motive to certify wonder are clear and drive choices; internal conflict when remembering the city adds depth. Micro-choices under pressure, like pausing based on taste, reveal values. Final renunciation of noise-driven world is earned with visible cost in the sculpted hush.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; orientation is immediate in the ice cavern. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost legible in the "sculpted hush" affecting distant hearts and streets. Causality tightens through bell strikes and chisel falls, leading to decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ice cavern setting pressures choices (e.g., blue ice column for bell) and charges the finale with sensory specificity. Recurring objects like amber music sheet and aurora constrain tactics and enrich atmosphere, avoiding postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certifying wonder) escalates through agency: bell ringing and chisel strikes intensify under accumulative lens. Cost is felt in the hush's emergence, recalibrating the world. No coincidence; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of wonder vs. noise emerges through images and actions, not statement; ending offers non-literal answer via the sculpted hush as a "vessel." Subtext in synesthetic experiences deepens resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature in synesthetic descriptions. No head-hopping; dialogue (signed) is minimal but functional. Rhythm modulates with pressure, e.g., aurora slowing to legible pace.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical prose with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("prism-song," "whale-road tremor") is coherent and purposeful. Propulsion maintained through concise, image-driven sentences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of synesthesia, sculpted silence, and aurora as metronome feels inevitable. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry; concept transforms familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
