<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with clear motivation rooted in trauma. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final renunciation (knotting the mask strap) is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as feeling displaced yet rooted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive lens holds, with closure as a conceptual repricing where the protagonist leaves a rule etched on bark. Cost is legible when the trees dim to normal green, indicating calibration. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the pattern of reflection is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest functions as micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details purposeful and filtered through POV. The environment pressures tactics, such as the undergrowth painting shins with cobalt fire, and spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with stakes tightening through actions like bracing and knotting the mask strap. Cost is unmistakable when the forest flares with ultraviolet, representing remorse, and the final path brightens with visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of mercy and trauma emerges through events and images, not direct statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the theorem and etched angles. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, such as the mask strap whispering, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic syntax and rhythm under pressure. Voice remains consistent, and any elision (e.g., fragmented memories) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with rhythmic variation. Minor overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "photosynthesize regret") slightly muddles peak beats, but no loops or scaffolds obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes enhanced interrogation, proprioception, and ultraviolet penance with specificity and risk-taking, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Transformation of tropes through grounded choices in character and world, and the final image recharges prior material with bold ingenuity.</comment>
