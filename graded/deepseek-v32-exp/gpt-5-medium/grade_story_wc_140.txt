<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation is clear and rooted in erasure survival; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "fingertips taste bitter"). Micro-choices under pressure, like showing the label and confronting the widow, reveal values and earn the final renunciation. The widow is less developed but secondary, not harming closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with fragments building to a Charged Poise closure: narrator places the label, letting the widow choose, with cost legible in her fear and his continued erasure. Orientation is clear early; causality is intact with no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral, with the container labyrinth constraining choices (e.g., guiding searches) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like "oily constellations" and "corrugated walls," reflecting POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake in uncovering truth escalates through narrator's agency: collecting fragments, showing label, confrontation. Cost is legible in the widow's trembling and narrator's enduring erasure. Under accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of erased histories emerges through events and images, not statement; subtext operates in gestures (widow's hand trembles). Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature ("filter reality differently"). Voice is poetic and consistent, with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is purposeful, though slightly overwritten in peaks (e.g., "bitter memory on my fingers"), but clarity and momentum remain high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and transformative: death certificate error survivor in a port city. Specific details and risk-taking in accumulative structure heighten stakes without gimmickry. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
