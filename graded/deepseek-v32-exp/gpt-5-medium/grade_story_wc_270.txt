<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lida's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as her decision to unseal the embryo alone. Her internal conflict between evolving tradition and council preservation is dramatized, and her final choice is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with clear linkages; closure lands on-page as the seedling roots and reconfigures the situation, with cost legible in Lida's defiance. Orientation is anchored early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the volcanic hot springs constraining choices (e.g., the vault location and unsealing method). Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes in tradition vs. evolution escalate through Lida's agency under the causal lens, from finding the kite to unsealing the embryo. Cost is visible in her confrontation with the council and the irreversible growth of the seedling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as the plant whispers and unsealing, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic yet consistent diction reflecting Lida's perspective. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off, as in the kite decoding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and supports pressure, especially in closure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable, with risk-taking in blending telepathy, tradition, and sci-fi concepts. Specific details transform tropes, heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
