<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with embodied emotions like "clover melancholy fogged my glasses." Final choice to teach both ruin and resilience is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her history. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, with closure as a conceptual repricing where risk is reweighted through the final bus scene. Cost is legible in "the odds change, mercifully and slowly." Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and pattern pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image; the candle lantern's mica pane "lensing of the rain" directly shapes the protagonist's realization. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, like "rainwashed library" and "steamed clover."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens, with discovery of the lantern and theorem forcing a stance crystallization. Cost is legible in her decision to teach both stories, foreclosing prior avoidance. Dominant stake of reconciling risk tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of lucid contradictions emerges through events and images, not statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the bus scene and changed odds. Subtext in "Check your priors" note deepens without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV has a distinct perceptual signature with probability metaphors ("each drop a discrete coin"). Voice is consistent under pressure, with rhythmic control and no head-hopping. Elision in subway scrawls is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, e.g., "rain teaches gutters to sing," and clarity is maintained in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of probability, gambling, and personal history feels inevitable, with risk-taking in structure heightening stakes. Specific details like the martingale alcove transform familiar tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
