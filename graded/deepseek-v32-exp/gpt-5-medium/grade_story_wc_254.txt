<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Collective POV effectively conveys shared motivation and micro-choices under pressure, such as synchronized breathing, with embodied emotion. The poet's actions are consistent and drive the narrative, though individual depth is limited by the "we" perspective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration as the group steps through boundaries, with cost legible in the guard's tears and badge removal. Orientation is clear early, and causality builds through imagery to a decisive shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the quartz colonnade tuning to the poet's pulse and the frozen lake cracking, charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from fear to courage under accumulative lens, driven by collective agency like breathing together and stepping across lines. Cost is visible in the guard's transformation and the lake's response, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images and actions, such as paraphrasing the decree into an ethics of presence, without moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer with "fertile" certainty, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person plural POV is stable and distinct, with poetic rhythm and perceptual signature. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure, such as the lantern-moth hush modulating with pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative but purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. No significant loops or artifacts; minor overwriting in peaks doesn't obscure clarity, and closure remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-ban transformation feels inevitable, with specific details like the quartz colonnade and collective POV heightening stakes. Risk-taking in lyrical style pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
