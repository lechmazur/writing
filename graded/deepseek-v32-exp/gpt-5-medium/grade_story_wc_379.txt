<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to prove listening heals is clear and consistent, driving choices under pressure. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions and micro-choices, such as setting out cups and using the locket, that reveal character. The final action of tapping stories into the lock is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in shared vulnerabilities.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as the mailbox sighs open, convinced by communal stories, under the accumulative/textural lens. Cost is legible in the emotional weight of shared confessions and Noemi's departure. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the lock changing from metal to ache.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and integral, with the courtyard and mailbox constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "sandal scuffs and coffee breath" are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV. The mailbox acts as a micro-setting that alters tactics and resolves the mystery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, as listening intensifies through neighborhood stories, narrowing options to the mailbox opening. Cost is unmistakable in confessions like Marta's son at sea, forcing a trade-off between vulnerability and healing. Pressure coheres and deepens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of listening as healing emerges organically from events and images, such as the mailbox opening with a "chorus," without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the unlocked mailbox as an "ongoing song," reweighting prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature that reflects the curator's worldview. Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., "We became a metronome of ache," and elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; dialogue, when present, is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No significant loops or artifacts; figurative language like "gritty and tender hush" is coherent and purposeful. Minor overwriting in peaks doesn't harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of community storytelling and a mystical mailbox, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the concept is transformed through specific, grounded details like the locket's hairpin.</comment>
