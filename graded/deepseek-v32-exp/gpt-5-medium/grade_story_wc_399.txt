<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear and consistent, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. The line walker's traits, like peripheral awareness and masked honesty, drive key turns, and the keeper's resolve to preserve echoes is earned. However, contradictory impulses are subtle rather than stark, limiting peak complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, as the echo settles and the promise to repeat forecloses paths with felt cost. Orientation is clear early, and the kinetic parapet's shifting constrains tactics. The prophet's silent presence charges the final image without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices, such as the kinetic parapet heaving to meet the wind or the murmuring pavilion guiding clearings. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, with the dunes and pavilion constraining actions and charging the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes around preserving echoes escalate through the wind's threat and the walker's stitching, driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the effort to hush the pavilion and the prophet's nod, though the escalation is more textural than causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of echo versus blare emerges through concrete events and images, like the cup set on the floor, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the settled echo and repeated endurance, reweighting prior material with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent in first-person plural, with poetic rhythm and perceptual signature. Peripheral awareness as a method is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm and variation, advancing story without scaffolds. Minor overwriting in peaks, like "diffident but real," slightly muddles clarity but does not harm closure. No loops or artifacts obscure cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements like the kinetic parapet and conjured clearings feels inevitable, with risk-taking in accumulative design heightening stakes. The concept is fully committed to and transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world.</comment>
