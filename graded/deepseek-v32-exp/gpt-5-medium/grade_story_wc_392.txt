<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion like trembling assignment sheet and steady breathing. Final choice to report truth is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in personal and procedural changes. Micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost as investigator reports truth and releases lantern, reforming procedures. Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages from investigation to revelation. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraint of controlling influence shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Subway tunnel setting is vivid and atmospheric, with sensory details like salt crust and ripples constraining choices and charging the final image. Specificity is purposeful, such as the lantern's soot and polished handle, integrated into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth vs. control escalates through protagonist's agency, with pressure from supervisor and entangled memories forcing a choice. Cost is legible in the report signing and lantern release, narrowing options under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of community risk and memory emerges through events and images like the lantern and drowned workers, not direct statement. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer with conceptual cost in procedural reform, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, poetic rhythm, and controlled elision. Voice modulates under pressure, such as in the climax with "the flame compressed, then flared," and no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "wet breath rising" is purposeful, and sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of historical echoes with modern investigation feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific choices. Risk-taking in lyric narrative heightens stakes, and closure reweights prior material with emotional truth.</comment>
