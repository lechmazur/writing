<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Narrator's synesthesia and ghost's encore-seeking are well-motivated, with consistent micro-choices under pressure. Closure shows earned endurance, but internal contradiction is subtle rather than deeply conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in "sweep the empty seats" and "promising to return only if we can finish letting go together." Orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (maze rearranges, orchard leans) and charges closure with "door of leaves opens onto the stage." Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens, using coin to anchor Star and speak names, with cost in nostalgia and letting go. Stakes around fractured timeline cohere.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory and caretaking emerges through images like "fractured timeline" and "apples bright as cues," with non-literal resolution in bowing to orchard. No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV stable with distinct perceptual signature from synesthesia ("blue becomes a bell I can smell"). Voice is poetic and consistent; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "paint shivers like spilled music" is coherent and advances atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of synesthesia, ghost, and fractured timeline feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric style that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
