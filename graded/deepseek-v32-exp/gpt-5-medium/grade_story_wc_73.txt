<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's grim optimism is embodied through consistent micro-choices under pressure, such as rolling the skewed dice and not stepping through the rupture, with the final endurance earned by prior causality. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing, and the resolution forecloses a path with visible cost in the sealed seam.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under the accumulative/textural lens, with cost legible in the "thin luminous seam" and the persistent constraint of regret shaping tactics. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, reinforced by the final proof.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The infinite staircase functions as a micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "chalk refuses to wear down" and "black slots that sip my warmth" woven through action. Specificity is purposeful and POV-filtered, mirroring internal states without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency through dice rolls and proof-writing, deepening the stake of capturing missed opportunity with cost unmistakable in the rupture's sealing. Pressure coheres and tightens via pattern breaks like the dice balancing on edge, narrowing options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events, offering a resonant non-literal answer to regret and motion through the final proof without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like not stepping through the rupture, and the core concept integrates through specific particulars like the chipped die.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and single with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, rhythmic prose that modulates under pressure without head-hopping. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure, with diction consistent to the character's worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold, with figurative language like "texture, granular as dust" serving clarity and momentum. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and peak beats avoid muddle or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes perpetual motion, mathematical proofs, and regret into a non-obvious, inevitable whole, with risk-taking in structure heightening stakes without gimmickry. The chipped die and infinite staircase are transformed through specific, grounded choices that avoid template plots.</comment>
