<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrator's contradictory impulses of skepticism and forgiveness are embodied in micro-choices, such as pocketing the tooth despite disbelief, and the final decision to "tell it plain" is earned by prior causality with visible cost in Ari's eroded shame. Ari's motivation is rooted in consistent traits of yearning and protection, compelling higher-stakes choices. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in "the ache of repairs and the relief of a limb remembered," under an accumulative/textural lens that holds. Orientation is anchored early with town, body, and maze, and the pattern of imagery builds to a legible before/after shift. The inferred lens is consistent, and cost is unmistakable in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image: the hedge maze hides Ari, the secret garden yields the tooth, and the fountain stone becomes a repository for closure. Sensory details like "mint and iron" and "moonlight" are selective and POV-filtered, reflecting urgency and professional bias. Spatial choreography is coherent, with the maze rearranging itself to guide the path out.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with a meaningful tightening from discovering the tooth to Ari's emergence and the shoulder-setting, narrowing options and changing knowledge. Cost is legible in Ari's "shame had eroded him" and the narrator's relief. The dominant stake of truth and healing is signaled early and reweighted with density increase.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like bone setting and constellations, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to doubt and healing without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures (pocketing the tooth) and images (the tooth under the stone), and the final reconfiguration invites reflection through earned wisdom. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature, rhythmic control under pressure, and purposeful elision taught early. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (Linnet's whispers, Ari's confession), carrying subtext. Voice modulation with emotional intensity is effective, and diction remains within the narrator's lexicon, avoiding head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with sentences advancing story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language is coherent and purposeful, though slight overwriting in peaks (e.g., "bright bones of the sky") doesn't harm closure. No loops or scaffolds obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes familiar themes through specific, grounded choices like the bone setter metaphor and changeling tooth, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional specificity avoids generic templates. The core premise offers a fresh angle on doubt and redemption.</comment>
