<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotions, such as the pen nib smelling of ink and cedar. The final choice to intervene is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the caretaker's astonishment and world's reaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout with clear linkage from journalist's call to wager and closure. On-page decisive change occurs when protagonist intervenes and changes observatory's purpose, with cost legible in the emergency light blink and printer halt. Orientation is anchored early, and closure reconfigures options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the observatory above clouds constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "hollow hush" and "console blink like constellations" are selective and reflect POV bias. The environment pressures tactics, such as the device test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering truth escalates through protagonist's agency in the wager, narrowing options and revealing cost when the device is shut down. Escalation is driven by her intervention under causal lens, with on-page cost in the world's reaction and caretaker's wonder.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of truth and influence emerges through events and images, not direct statement. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer with conceptual repricing in the protagonist's call to stop orbiting silence. Subtext operates in gestures like the caretaker's flinch and the dome's echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, such as "devotedly observant" and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is lyrical and consistent, with dialogue natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "echoes regroup like tame rain" is purposeful and clear. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and closure image is undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise offers fresh synthesis of influence and truth, transformed through specific choices like the wager and pen nib. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight, with bold choices.</comment>
