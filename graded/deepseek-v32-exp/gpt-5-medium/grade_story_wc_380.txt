<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in loss, with embodied interiority (e.g., sister's laugh in shoulder). Micro-choices under pressure, like exhuming the box, reveal values, and the final sealing of the memory is earned with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as longing versus duty, enhancing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with closure as Charged Poise: the final image reconfigures meaning with cost felt in "hands full." Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality coheres through patterned escalation. The memory sheet discovery pays off earlier setup without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the salt chamber and gravity pockets constraining choices (e.g., sand hardening into plates). Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, like "gleaming silence." The whale charges the final image, and spatial choreography remains coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding deleted memories) escalates through protagonist agency under accumulative lens, from lighting lamps to exhuming the box. Cost is legible when the memory is sealed, foreclosing other paths. Pressure tightens meaningfully without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images like gravity and memory, with subtext in gestures (e.g., wildflowers pulsing). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, such as the sister's misnamed star.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic yet consistent, and dialogue with the chemist is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "gravity seed bursting the page." Sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative design, and no artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements like gravity pockets and memory sheets feels inevitable, with specific details (e.g., salt crystal chamber) avoiding cliché. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional truth in sister's loss anchors freshness.</comment>
