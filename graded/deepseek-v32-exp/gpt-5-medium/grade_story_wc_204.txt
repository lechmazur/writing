<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is deeply rooted in personal history (mother's wish) and embodied emotion; micro-choices under pressure (unscrewing seed, setting line) reveal hierarchy of values; final choice to bind eternity earns cost through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing under Accumulative lens, with cost legible in library's flinch and rejection of perfection; orientation is clear early; lens holds without ambiguity, and persistent constraint (buoyancy) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting (glass orchard, cloud sea) constrains choices and charges final image; sensory details (frost patterns, rustling) are selective and purposeful; environment pressures tactics and supports theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (buoyancy vs. perfection) escalates through protagonist's agency (decision to print clause); cost is visible in library's stillness and motion; under Accumulative lens, density increase reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (imperfection, negotiation) emerges from images and events without moralizing; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through "wobble, murmur, agree, and float"; subtext in whisper and frost deepens complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and rhythmically controlled under pressure; no head-hopping; elision (frost patterns) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and atmosphere; clarity and propulsion are maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise (negotiable reality, glass orchard) is fresh and non-obvious; synthesis feels organic and inevitable; risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
