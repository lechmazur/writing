<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority (e.g., "desire fogged into dread"). The final choice to sing is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in overcoming fear. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as the tension between wanting freedom and dread.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a resonant reconfiguration (the idea of return freed through song), under an accumulative/textural lens that holds. Cost is legible in the warming of the tongue and the locksmith's latch metaphor. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of imagery coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the shadowed nexus and broken mirrors constraining choices and charging the final image (mirrors align into a cathedral). Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as "broken mirrors angled toward different stars," enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, from following the locksmith to speaking the promise and singing. Dominant stake (freeing the idea from fear) tightens with a visible cost: the vocal risk overcoming dread. One meaningful deepening occurs at the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in silence and gesture (e.g., the locksmith's nods). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to fear's grip through the freed idea of return, without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars like the lock of hair.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful compression (e.g., "absence were a language"). No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful (e.g., "courtyard bent"), though slightly dense in peaks, but clarity remains. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and non-obvious, transforming the locksmith trope through specific metaphorical choices. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in the lyrical approach that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
