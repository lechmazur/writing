<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation is clear and rooted in a vow, with embodied emotion ("saltshaken hand") and micro-choices under pressure. The Fractal weaver applies secondary pressure, and the narrator's final acceptance of their own burden is earned with visible cost. Minor hairline slip in lack of deep internal contradiction, but closure choice is motivated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds throughout; closure is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost as the narrator steps out with new understanding. Orientation is anchored early, and the persistent constraint of "orienting properly" shapes tactics. No causality breaks; cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the bronze grotto and kerosene lamp constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered, enhancing atmosphere. Spatial choreography is coherent, and micro-setting elements like the threads deepen the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of weighing burdens escalates through accumulative density, driven by protagonist agency in handling each burden. Cost is unmistakable in moments like the narrator's trembling and the fear's resolution. Under the accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening reweights options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as the "shingled hush" and burden weights, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is character-specific and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; figurative language is consistent and purposeful. Minor overwriting in peak beats does not harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of burdens and weights feels inevitable, with risk-taking in poetic style heightening stakes. Specific details like the Fractal weaver and calcify action transform familiar material. No derivative premise; authenticity of vision is strong.</comment>
