<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied micro-choices under pressure; final alias choice ("Auricle") is earned by prior causality and visible cost in the waiting. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; orientation is immediate with who, where, when anchored early. Closure is a Charged Poise (waiting before sending) with legible cost in "heart loud as sorting machinery" and realization of personal past, reshaping meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting (golden arcade) constrains choices via chalk codes and bench, charging the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, e.g., "grit cling to my knees," filtered through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency in decoding chalk and choosing name; cost is unmistakable in the patience and foreclosed options, with stakes tightly braided into closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of identity and communication emerges organically from particulars like surface mail and chalk codes; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the waiting image, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is poetic and consistent, e.g., "futuristic nostalgia," and elision (chalk codes) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and clear, e.g., "speed kills certain meanings the same way glare erases chalk," supporting propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of pseudonym creation and chalk codes feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional specificity avoids templates.</comment>
