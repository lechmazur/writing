<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara and the narrator are vividly characterized with consistent traits; Mara's dance as code-breaking is a unique, embodied trait that drives the plot. The narrator's fear is cataloged in micro-choices under pressure, and the motivation to liberate names is clear and intensifies. The final release is earned through prior causality, with cost felt in the image of "liberated voices crossing."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, with the freeing of names and the "knot deciding it had been a bow" offering a decisive change with conceptual cost. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The hangman's dice and dance pattern teach early and pay off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory setting is richly specific, with rust, fish, and silt filtering through the POV to constrain choices (e.g., dance on flooded tiles). Sensory details are purposeful and selective, and the environment charges the final image of liberated voices. Micro-settings like the dice and journals actively shape tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes to liberate names are signaled early and escalate under the accumulative lens through dice rolls and dance steps, driven by protagonist agency. The cost is legible in the release and the "barometric weight" of drowned names leaning toward rescue. One meaningful tightening occurs as doubt opens the vent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of encrypting vulnerability as strength emerges organically from dance, dice, and journal entries, without direct statement. Subtext operates in gestures like Mara's pivot, and the final image of voices crossing offers a resonant, non-literal answer. No moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, reflected in phrases like "the way a tide remembers the shore." Perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., dance as explanation) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; prose rhythm heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic but clear, with varied syntax and rhythm (e.g., "each step a syllable of a solution"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; information advances story and atmosphere. Line-level propulsion is strong, even in peak beats like the Warden's pulse.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes sunken labs, coded dance, and hangman's dice with originality, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details like "dice remember hesitation" transform tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
