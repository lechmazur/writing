<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Logistician's motives are clear and rooted in consistent traits, with micro-choices under pressure like redirecting leftovers and assigning tasks. Narrator's interiority is concrete, embodied in observations such as "smile of someone who had traded sleep for maps." Final choice to slip moon rock into child's pocket earns credibility through prior causality, showing cost in foreclosing personal attachment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive lens holds, with closure as Conceptual Repricing via the moon rock's transfer and note left, reweighting loneliness cure with cost legible in "return the thermos to the poet." Orientation anchors early in first paragraph; structure uses mosaic shards taught by ~25% with coherent transitions to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges final image, as station's ivy and leaking skylight shape tactics like using crates for postcards. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, e.g., "rain that smelled like green metal." Recurring moon rock object alters options and resonates at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of curing loneliness escalates under accumulative lens through density increase, such as rumor chains adding elements and logistician's list-making. Cost is legible in final promises and moon rock's weight, though agency is more communal than individual, slightly softening pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocity emerges through particulars like moon rock handling and rules on chalkboard, avoiding direct statement. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via "you are holding one end and someone else is holding the other," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "organizer move like a punchline waiting for its setup." Voice modulates under pressure with rhythmic control, and purposeful elision like rumor mechanics is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing multiple layers like "logistician moved quickest, translating candles into routes." No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; closure image remains clear despite lyrical density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes disaster relief and loneliness cure through specific, grounded choices like moon rock as gift. Risk-taking in accumulative structure and tone heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight with transformation of tropes.</comment>
