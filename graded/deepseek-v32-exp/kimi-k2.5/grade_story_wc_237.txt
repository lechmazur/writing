<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to transform scars into stories is clear and drives every choice; interiority is concretely embodied through physical sensations like burning lungs and yielding crystals. The contradiction between rational scholarship and youthful superstition acts in scene, and her final renunciation of the deepest scar is earned by prior causality with visible cost (held breath, emotional resistance). No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are shown through specific, character-particular perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change: scars shed into narrative pages, breath released, storm resumes—cost legible in "lungs screamed" and the resisting wound. Causal lens holds tightly: stress triggers crystallization, therefore inscription required; revisiting superstitions enables success. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (who, where, when), and the persistent constraint of held breath shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (floating rock platform, storm) pressures choice by triggering stress and isolating Elara; micro-setting (quill, crystals) constrains action and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (electric scent, dim light, saturated hush), filtered through POV with professional bias. Spatial choreography is clear, and environment evolves with the climax, breaking the hush with thunder.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shed crystals before losing dexterity) is signaled early and tightens under causal pressure: held breath forces urgency, deepest wound resists, escalating cost. Agency drives escalation—Elara actively inscribes, uses tear for final rune—and the payoff is earned with visible physical and emotional price. No coincidence; one meaningful tightening (final crystal's resistance) forecloses easy paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (trauma transformed into enduring art through integration of rationality and superstition) emerges organically from concrete actions and images, not statement. Subtext operates in gestures (childhood chant, tear) and the final image of tea with survival pages offers a resonant, non-literal answer. No moralizing; thematic resonance arises from particulars like the shed crystals becoming manuscript.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV (third-person limited) is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature: lyrical, scholarly diction reflects Elara's mindset, and syntax modulates with urgency (short sentences under pressure). No head-hopping; voice remains consistent under stress, and any elision (e.g., breath-holding) is taught and paid off at closure. No dialogue, but internal voice is coherent and specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, advancing story, character, and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("crystallized memories") is consistent and clear, with no mixed metaphors or register drift. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with inscription beats and breathes at closure. Read-aloud ear test passes with varied openings and paragraph lengths.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar tropes (magical healing, scholarly apprenticeship) through specific, grounded choices: crystallizing scars, rune inscription, breath-between-storms concept. Feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking (lyrical density, integrated superstition) heightening stakes without obscuring clarity. Details are particular and irreplaceable, committing fully to the premise.</comment>
