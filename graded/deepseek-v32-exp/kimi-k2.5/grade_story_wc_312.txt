<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's "lukewarm" ability and "brittle devotion" are concretely embodied through precise actions like measuring drops with trembling fingers; her naive hope battles felt impossibility, earning her final vigilant stance with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as the bell's sound triggers water seeping back—a resonant reconfiguration under a causal lens; the dripping-rate constraint shapes tactics, and cost is legible in her endless vigil.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The sapphire viaduct and its dripping water actively constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory details are selective, filtered through Elara's urgency, making setting indispensable to the outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (righting cosmic imbalance) escalates via Elara's agency: her realization that rebuilding sound, not seas, tightens options; cost is unmistakable in her patient, measured endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from precision over power; the ending's image of seeping water offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior particulars through earned insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; poetic yet controlled voice ("brittle devotion," "plausible impossibility") modulates with emotional pressure, and no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or scaffold; figurative language ("willpower thinner than spider silk") is consistent and clarity is maintained through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of a mediocre mage succeeding through precision rather than power; specific details (dripping rates, calculations) feel organic and heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
