<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to graft onto community is concrete and intensifies under pressure; interiority is embodied in weeping from relief, and the final choice to offer the reed bridge is earned by prior causality with visible cost of dissolved loneliness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure lands on-page with Kael's dedication and the mute artist's blessing, a decisive change where cost is legible in the "luminescent ache" and the bridge's permanence; orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image: the crystalline orchard isolates, the crater's danger necessitates the bridge, and the obsidian arbor hosts key gatherings; sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of community escalates through the shared search and Kael's offerings; agency drives the deepening, with cost felt in years of loneliness overcome; under accumulative lens, density increase reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of loneliness versus connection emerges through particulars like reed sculptures and webs of kinship; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the bridge image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical yet controlled, diction consistent; no head-hopping, and elision (e.g., "beyond the murmur of lost languages") is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variation; no loops or scaffold; figurative language ("luminescent ache") is purposeful and clear, though slightly abstract, but does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of isolation, art, and community through specific details like marsh-reed sculptor and crystalline orchard; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
