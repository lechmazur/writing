<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and contradictory (shrewd innocence vs. surgical precision), with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure; her final act of placing the coral and reinterpreting the notes is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in carrying the "lexicon of fear."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mara converts isolation into shared ritual, with cost legible in "decrypting it daily so that others might sleep"; orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the cast and coral shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective (mist-clad atrium, jungle pressure); the brain coral fragment and child's cast function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image, anchoring theme and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of translating trauma escalates through Mara's agency in decoding notes; under Accumulative lens, density increase reweights stakes, with cost felt in her burden and the promise of grafted wholeness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of healing through shared stories emerges organically from particulars (coral, notes, lotus image); ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and lyrical control; voice modulates with emotional intensity, and purposeful compression (e.g., "lotus-hearted ache") is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or scaffold; figurative language is integrated and clear, advancing story and character without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of trauma translation and coral imagery feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors emotional truth.</comment>
