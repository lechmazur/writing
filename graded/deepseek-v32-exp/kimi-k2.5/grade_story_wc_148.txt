<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his lineage and learned cunning. His internal conflict between deception and silence is embodied in his seven-year narrative construction and final escape. The final choice to hover—using narrative physics—is earned by his understanding of the lighthouse's nature, with visible cost in becoming a ghost. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Elias understands the lighthouse sustains impossibilities through stories, he can hover and escape. Closure is a Decisive Change (escape) with Conceptual Repricing (crying wolf in silence). Cost is legible in the final image: he becomes a rumor, leaving behind the dead bodies and his father's legacy. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the lighthouse prison's height, the cellar, the confessional, and the reef pressure Elias's escape. The lattice and the door scuffs function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias's perception, integrating with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape before bodies are found) escalates through a tightening timeframe. Elias's agency drives escalation: he uses the lattice and narrative physics to hover. Cost is legible on the page: he forecloses return and becomes a ghost, with the lighthouse's exhale acknowledging his story. One meaningful tightening under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of stories shaping reality emerges from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the boy who cried wolf's son learns to cry wolf in silence, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and image (lattice, hovering, copperlight). No moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature (lyrical, biased). Voice modulates with pressure, maintaining a consistent lexicon within Elias's understanding. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (the murder of the warden) is taught and paid off. Rhythm controls acceleration and breath.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic without overwriting; information density is high. Sentence-level propulsion varies with scene needs, from contemplative to urgent. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. Closure image is clear and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar elements (lighthouse prison, boy who cried wolf) through narrative physics feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in style and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise is transformed by specific lived detail and a non-obvious moral calculus (deception without witnesses).</comment>
