<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias is vividly characterized with embodied emotion and credible motivation; his internal contradiction as the whisper in Voss's shadow fuels a final choice earned by prior causality, cost visible in his weeping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate; closure lands with a decisive change (ship saved) and resonant reconfiguration (Elias's realization), cost legible in "weeping with the violence of his own quiet."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is sensory and integral—the cobalt lighthouse and jasmine cork constrain choice and charge the final image; micro-setting (cork, lens) actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save ship, prove method) escalates via Elias's agency; one meaningful tightening when he activates the cork, cost unmistakable in his emotional release and the ship's response.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through contrast and image, but slightly explicit statements in the final paragraph ("whispers travel farther than shouts") edge toward moralizing, slightly reducing resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with a distinct lyrical perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping; elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dense, poetic prose with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful; sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of lighthouse fantasy and quiet resilience; risk-taking in poetic density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; closure feels inevitable.</comment>
