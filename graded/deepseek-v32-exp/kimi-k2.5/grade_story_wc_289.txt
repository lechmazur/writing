<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her withdrawn nature; her epiphany and subsequent action to build the installation are earned, with embodied interiority and visible cost in years of silence. The final choice to reconnect is driven by her agency, and the relationship with Mara, though brief, serves as a crucible. The 9+ test is met: contradictory impulses (writing for others vs. her own silence) act in scene, and the renunciation of solitude is earned with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with Elara and Mara united, cost legible in the weathering installation and years of silence. Orientation is clear within 120 words. The nest/spiral pattern taught early pays off at closure, shaping tactics and final image. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice (temple as withdrawal, pond edge for discovery) and charges the final image (prism-windowed room). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, woven through action. The thrush's nest functions as a micro-setting that reweights meaning. Meets 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation vs. connection) signaled early; escalation driven by Elara's agency to build the installation, tightening options and risking exposure. Cost is legible in the labor and vulnerability. Under accumulative lens, density increase and pattern break reweight stakes. No coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images (nest, spiral, weaving) without moralizing; subtext in gesture and silence. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via the nest metaphor, reweighting prior material. No abstract statements; earned wisdom from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV (Elara) stable with distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature. Syntax and rhythm reflect her mindset; purposeful compression (years of silence) taught and paid off. Dialogue minimal but natural; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density, no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, clarity unimpaired even in peak beats. Rhythm varies naturally; sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative texture. No artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar premise (withdrawn artist) through specific setting, object (thrush's nest), and method (public art). Transformation feels inevitable in hindsight; emotional truth avoids templates. Risk-taking in lyrical, image-driven narrative heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
