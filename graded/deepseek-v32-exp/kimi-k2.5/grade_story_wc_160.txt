<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and his motivation—harmonizing ancient compassion with modern demands—is clear and intensifies under pressure. His final choice (renunciation of the upgrade) is earned by the discovery and decoding, with visible cost in his trembling hands and risk to his career. Slight summarization of emotional progression prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise) as Elias chooses to preserve the ancient system, with cost legible in his trembling and the conspiratorial falsification of logs. The hybrid (accumulative/causal) lens holds, though the decoding process occurs off-page, slightly softening causal linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The volcanic amphitheater is vividly rendered and actively pressures choice, functioning as a micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, woven through action. Capped due to high-band gate conditions not being fully met (Q2 < 8.8, Q7 < 8.2).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—compassionate safety vs. industrial efficiency—is signaled early and escalates through Elias's discovery and clandestine decision. Agency is clear, and cost is felt in his defiance. The external conflict with supervisors remains off-page, slightly limiting on-page pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between values, enriched by the chain's symbolism and the concept of encrypted compassion. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Capped due to high-band gate conditions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature that reflects Elias's expertise and reverence. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, though occasional register drift toward the overly poetic occurs. Capped due to high-band gate conditions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative, with strong rhythmic propulsion and high information density. Some overwriting and stacked metaphors in peak beats create minor artifacts that slightly dull clarity, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of engineering precision and moral philosophy feels fresh and inevitable. Specific, lived-in details (spectrometer, beeswax seals) anchor the premise. Risk-taking with lyrical prose is coherent. Capped due to high-band gate conditions.</comment>
