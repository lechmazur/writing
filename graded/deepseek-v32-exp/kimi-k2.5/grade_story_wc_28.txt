<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kael's contradictory impulses—augmented strength wielded with delicacy—are embodied in scene, and the final renaming choice is earned by prior retrocognitive strain. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("aberrant mercy") slightly abstracts motivation, but interiority remains concrete and micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing: Kael renames the plaza "Cradle," reweighting the site's meaning with the cost of holding pain without healing. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds tightly, retrocognitive trap constrains tactics, and cost is legible in the final line's "held, not healed." Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The shattered sky and vitrified sand are filtered through Kael's perception, but the mosaic stepping stone is indispensable—it constrains the choice (tracing cracks leads to the name) and decisively charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and fully integrated with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation builds through density of retrocognitive visions and the tactile act of placing the tessera. Kael's agency drives the single meaningful tightening—renaming—which forecloses sanitization or memorialization with a visible cost: enduring wounding without false comfort.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action—the tessera, the cracked patterns—culminating in the resonant, non-literal answer of "Cradle." Some explicit phrasing ("aberrant mercy") leans toward thematic echo, but the final reconfiguration avoids moralizing and lingers with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that modulates rhythm under pressure ("voice carrying both warmth and winter"). Any elision (retrocognitive jumps) is taught and paid off; no head-hopping; diction remains within the character's plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density; figurative language is consistent and pattern-taught, serving atmosphere. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates toward closure, though some may find the texture ornate—yet it never obscures causality or cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of retrocognitive trapping, aberrant mercy, and post-catastrophe renewal feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative, lyric design heightens stakes without gimmickry; the core premise is transformed through specific, charged particulars like the mosaic tessera and the final image of "cradling."</comment>
