<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyra's interior contradiction (mother as creature of darkness vs. preparer for light) is embodied in her quest; her final mural change is earned by the cathedral revelation, with cost in transformed grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain from question to discovery to reconfigured understanding; closure lands with legible cost in the transformation of grief; the postcards and window act as persistent constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The amber pavilion and cathedral window are not just backdrop but constrain and charge the revelation; sensory details (frost, dripping eaves) are filtered through Lyra's artist perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (understanding mother's faith) tighten through Lyra's daily visits; the sexton's revelation forces a reweighting of her goal, with cost in relinquished misunderstanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of radical hope emerges from the specific discovery of east-facing flowers; the final statement is earned but slightly explicit, preventing the highest band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited with a lyrical, artist-filtered voice; consistent perceptual signature; the sexton's dialogue is natural and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dense, poetic prose with high information density; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is controlled and serves the revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of art, grief, and botany; the east-facing flowers reveal is a non-obvious reversal that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
