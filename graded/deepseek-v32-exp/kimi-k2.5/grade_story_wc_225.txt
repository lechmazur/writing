<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with compulsive fidgeting and guilt driving meticulous action. The final acceptance (Earned Stasis) is earned by the decoding work, with a visible cost in the thawing village and his ceased fidgeting. Minor deduction for a hint of diagnostic self-awareness ("winnowing his shame") in an otherwise embodied arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: Kaelen's decoding leads to the labyrinth's revelation, which triggers the village's thaw and his acceptance. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise) with clear on-page cost in the unraveling silence and his stilled hands. Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The time-frozen village is a vivid, pressure-applying setting woven through action. The platinum labyrinth and tapestry function as micro-settings that constrain choice and decisively charge the final image (the mirror reveal). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Kaelen's analytical POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (absolution) escalates through Kaelen's agency in decoding the tapestry, tightening to the climactic reveal. Cost is legible in the emotional shift and the physical thawing. The escalation is driven by protagonist action under the causal lens, foreclosing his path of guilt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of guilt, acceptance, and reading hidden stories emerges organically from concrete actions (decoding threads, the mirror's truth). The final image of teaching children to "decode their own borders" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext is rich in the woven silence and thaw.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptional signature focused on patterns, geometry, and silence. Voice is consistently poetic yet controlled, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; elision (the prince's death) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly purposeful, with varied sentence structures. Information density is high; each line advances character or atmosphere. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. Minor deduction for occasional dense phrasing, but clarity and propulsion remain strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of exile, frozen time, and guilt decoded through a tactile, symbolic system (tapestry/labyrinth). The chess tutor trope is transformed by specific, lived detail. Risk-taking in poetic, accumulative style heightens stakes and coheres, with the closure image feeling inevitable.</comment>
