<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in years of preparation; interiority is concrete through sensory actions and micro-choices. The final renunciation (completing the sundial) is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction is minimal, she remains steadily competent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a Charged Poise with cost legible in the "geometrically inevitable" seeds of rebellion. Orientation is immediate, and the sundial's geometry acts as a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through Elara's POV and constrains choice: the blackout enables the decoding, and the sundial's micro-setting charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silent revolution) escalates via Elara's agency in completing the sundial, narrowing options. Cost is legible in the risk of insurrection and the tactical reconfiguration of power.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hidden rebellion emerges from particulars like the sundial's coded angles; subtext operates in silent actions. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the "quiet click of understanding."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; voice has a distinct perceptual signature with lyrical precision ("winking hush"). Rhythmic control under pressure supports clarity, and elision (e.g., the revolution's details) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense with high information density, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, and sentence-level propulsion matches scene urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elements (lock sentinel, sundial geometry) feels organic and inevitable; specific details transform tropes. Lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
