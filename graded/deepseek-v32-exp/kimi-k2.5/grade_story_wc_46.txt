<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies through embodied micro-choices (polishing, arranging). Her internal conflict—star-fire memory versus humble reflection—acts simultaneously in scene, and her final renunciation of destructive potential is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("the old hunger for flame subside"). The closure choice feels motivated and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building density of imagery and reflection toward closure. A decisive Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands on page with cost: the "pearl of stillness" forms, reconfiguring Mira's purpose and relationship to her past. Orientation is immediate, pattern taught, and the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto is a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables Mira's ritual; its "fissures" provide light, its mist responds to her. The sea glass as a recurring object charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully filtered through her POV, shaping choice and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive density increase and pattern break: the arrangement of glass culminates in the pearl's creation. The dominant stake ("share light without using fire") is tested and fulfilled via protagonist agency, with cost legible in the relinquishment of her "destructive potential."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (redemption through humility, light as reflection not combustion) emerges organically from concrete actions and images. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the pearl, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext is rich in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable, close third-person with a distinct perceptual signature ("earthbound star watcher"). The lyrical, precise voice is consistent and modulates with emotional intensity. Purposeful compression and patterned diction are taught and paid off, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative but controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variety that supports the accumulative drive. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates toward the climax. Minor overwriting risk is mitigated by pattern-teaching and closure payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a fallen celestial being, sea glass, and a "pearl of stillness" feels fresh and non-obvious. The premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and ritual. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking (lyrical density) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
