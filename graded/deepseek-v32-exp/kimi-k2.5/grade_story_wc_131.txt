<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maya's interiority is concrete and her motivation is clear and consistent, driving her methodical actions. However, the characterization lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and the emotional progression is steady without internal conflict, which prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—the final image of magnetic memories humming in the walls reconfigures meaning. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, and the orientation is clear early. The dawn and power return provide a meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice (crawl spaces, pipe chases). The environment charges the final image and atmosphere is woven into action. The "sapphire hush" and library details are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (leaving evidence for the invisible) is signaled early and tightens with the approaching dawn and returning power. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is a cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost legible in Maya's retreat and the artifacts left behind.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of visibility through artifacts emerges organically from concrete actions and images. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext is strong in the tape fragments as vessels of memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, methodical prose reflects Maya's mindset. No head-hopping; voice is controlled and purposefully elides dialogue, focusing on interiority and action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, no loops or scaffolding. Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language is consistent and purposeful. No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of a crawl space dweller leaving magnetic tape fragments for the invisible is fresh and specific. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
