<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's embodied anxiety and purposefully curious nature drive micro-choices under pressure; her final stance with Kael is earned by shared scars and the clipping's resonance, with cost legible in the roots' wet tearing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal linkage tightens from root-binding to eclipsed-covenant realization; closure is a Charged Poise at the shimmering node, with felt cost in the tearing roots and fragile hope, lens held.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt glade and maze clipping constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory selection (humming trees, stained grass) is filtered through Elara's urgency, elevating stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (rewriting timeline) escalate via glade shift and dusk deadline; agency is dual (freeing, understanding eclipse) with visible cost in root-release and anxious elation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of eclipsed time emerges through scars and clipping; ending reweights via "eclipsed—hidden" realization without moralizing, offering resonant negotiation between past and future.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV (Elara) stable with lyrical perceptual signature; dialogue sparse but natural ("You came"), voice consistent under pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with varied rhythm and high information density; no loops or scaffold, though figurative language ("premature chronology") risks slight overwriting without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of time collapse, root-binding, and scar-linked trauma; specific details (cobalt glade, maze clipping) feel organic and heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
