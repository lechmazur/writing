<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent skepticism; her interiority is concrete via actions like clutching the fly amber. The final stance of "luminous skeptics" is earned, though the emotional embodiment under peak pressure remains slightly abstract, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly; closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing ("homecoming isn't a return; it's a reaction") with legible cost in the final image of eternal questioning. Structure moves seamlessly from external scene to internal lab, with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful—the "rainwashed tower" and "fly amber" are micro-settings that constrain choice (shelter for illicit lab) and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's analytical POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding the true transformation) escalates via the convergence of researchers and the revelation of data. Under the accumulative lens, deepening occurs through accumulated imagery and the final conceptual shift, with cost felt in the enduring displacement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the fly amber metaphor and the dialogue on homecoming; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The integration of concept and character arc is seamless and intellectually charged.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, analytical voice consistent throughout. Prose rhythm modulates with the accumulative density, and any elision (e.g., the Visitors' nature) is purposeful and paid off in the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional: high information density, varied syntax, and figurative language that coheres without muddle. No loops or scaffolding artifacts; the final paragraph's rhythm reinforces the closure cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis—a post-first-contact story focused on psychological displacement rather than alien spectacle. The "artificial pilgrimage" concept and fly amber metaphor feel inevitable in hindsight, and the literary risk heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
