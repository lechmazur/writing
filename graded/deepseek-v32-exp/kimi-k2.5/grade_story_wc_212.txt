<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her lineage; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion ("furiously tranquil determination"). Her final choice is earned by prior causality, and the cost is felt in her realization of being both borrower and lender.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate; closure lands on-page with a resonant reconfiguration (reopening the covenant) and visible cost under an accumulative/textural lens. The vortex inheritance concept shapes tactics and the final image, with cost legible in the transformed atrium.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The icebound atrium is vividly rendered and constrains choice; the oak acorn cap as micro-setting charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, fully integrated with action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start; escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens (singing songs, decreasing entropy). The cost is visible in the thawing earth and her realization, tightening the narrative effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions—vortex inheritance, borrowed time—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of green inheritances and ascending droplets.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is consistent. Diction and rhythm control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity, and elision (e.g., "furiously tranquil") is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative but pattern-taught and coherent; no loops or scaffold. Information density is high, with propulsion matching scene needs. Minor overwriting in peak beats does not harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing seed-saving, entropy reversal, and inheritance uniquely. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
