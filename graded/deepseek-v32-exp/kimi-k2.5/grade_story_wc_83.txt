<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Amara's grief-driven hunt is concretely embodied in trembling fingers and bleak exhilaration; her final choice to descend for quantum residue is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the fractured geode. Contradictory impulses—seeking confirmation, not revenge—act in scene, and micro-choices under time pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with felt cost (geode fracture, weight of tomorrow) under a coherent Causal lens; the time constraint from circuit breakers tightens options via because/therefore linkages, and orientation is anchored within 120 words without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating observatory pressures choices via rebooting systems and AI surveillance, while the geode crystal functions as micro-setting that constrains action (filtering algorithms) and charges the final image as map and memorial, all filtered through Amara's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding the quantum reservoir) escalates under causal agency as the circuit-breaker clock narrows options; cost is legible in the geode's fracture and her bleak exhilaration, forcing a trade-off that forecloses other paths with on-page pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of loss and quantum potential emerges from particulars (perturbation theory, geode metaphor) without moralizing; the ending reweights prior material via a resonant, non-literal answer—death as redirection, futures as vibrating strings—that avoids abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature blending scientific lexicon and grief; voice modulates under pressure (e.g., "bleak exhilaration sharpens into a point") and any elision (e.g., perturbation theory) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold; figurative language ("pooled like rainwater") is purposeful, and peak beats maintain clarity with no register drift or artifice that obscures closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of quantum physics and grief feels inevitable; risk-taking in high-concept premise heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity (geode, perturbation theory) transforms tropes through grounded character choices and emotional truth.</comment>
