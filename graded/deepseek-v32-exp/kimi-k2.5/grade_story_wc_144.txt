<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear, rooted in trauma and penance, and intensifies under time pressure. Her interiority is concrete and embodied (feeling micro-fractures, reading water patterns). The final choice to repair and release the drone is an earned renunciation of guilt, with visible cost in the final paragraph's "weight of purpose fulfilled." No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression is credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens is clear and held: drone crash necessitates repair to avert disaster. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): her guilt is reconfigured into purpose as the drone and ship align, with cost legible in "the weight of purpose fulfilled...anchoring her to the moment." Orientation is immediate; structure is a single, tight scene with a meaningful tightening (the hour deadline).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered through non-visual senses (sound, vibration, thermal patterns) filtered through Mira's unique perception. The depot, basin, and weather are atmospheric and pressure the choice via the ticking clock and mist. The water basin and drone function as micro-settings that crucially constrain her method and charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save the ship/redeem herself) is signaled early and tightens via the audible anchor chain and one-hour deadline. Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens: she must decode and repair using her specialized method. The cost is the emotional weight of her past and the tangible pressure of the task, culminating in the resonant closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (redemption, transforming sensory loss into guidance) emerges organically from Mira's specific method and backstory. Subtext operates through the water-refraction metaphor and the parallel between the ship's anchor and her "anchor of guilt." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of aligned trajectories, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable, close third-person limited to Mira. Voice is distinct and consistent, with perceptual signature shaped by her blindness (emphasis on tactile, auditory, thermal data). Prose rhythm modulates with her "magnetic calm." No dialogue; elision (her past accident) is anchored in the present and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and precise, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("mechanical heartbeat," "spider-webbed the metal") is coherent and voice-motivated. Sentence rhythm varies effectively with the action. No artifacts or register drift to obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a blind artisan using hydro-acoustic synesthesia to repair a drone is a fresh, non-obvious angle. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded character detail and world logic. The risk of a quiet, internal climax pays off with a resonant reconfiguration. The story feels singular and inevitable.</comment>
