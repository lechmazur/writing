<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya’s tidal-pool chronicler profession and the narrator’s embodied hesitation create rich interiority; the final choice to wait is earned by the accumulated pressure of the conversation, with cost felt in the cicada’s weight against shifting water. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are concretely filtered through observation and touch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds tightly; closure is a charged poise (the exchanged cicada and agreement to wait) with cost legible in the final image of “permanence against the shifting water.” Orientation is immediate; the single-scene structure deepens through pattern and reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Grotto and starlight are vividly sensory and purposefully mirror the liminal theme; the jade cicada as micro-setting charges the closure. Details are filtered through POV and integrated with action—no static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (relationship future) escalates through Maya’s tangential speech and the cicada’s giving; the tightening is the narrator’s decision to accept the pause, with cost visible in the traded token and deferred answer.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transition periods emerges organically from tide pools, cicada, and conversation; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the cicada held against water, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical but controlled perceptual signature; dialogue carries subtext, and the voice modulates with emotional intensity while maintaining consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with varied rhythm and zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and coherent, and the final beat lands with precise, charged imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal-pool chronicler, jade cicada, and grotto setting feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure reconfigures familiar material with specificity.</comment>
