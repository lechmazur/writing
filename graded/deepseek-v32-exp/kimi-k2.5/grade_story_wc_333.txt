<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vey's interiority is concrete and her motivation clear, but lacks on-page contradictory impulses under pressure; her final choice is earned but cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt, limiting emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with the idea freed and nexus shifted, cost implied in courage; orientation is early and clean, but cost is not unmistakably felt on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the nexus and lock of hair constraining choice and charging the final image; sensory detail is selective and woven through action, supporting tone and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation is driven by Vey's agency under accumulative lens, but cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally paid; tightening forecloses the trapped idea's imprisonment, yet visible price is subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in gesture and implication; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer about longing and fear without moralizing, though slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with lyrical, perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure and purposeful elision are taught and paid off, enhancing the accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, accelerating with scene needs, though minor purple tinge is controlled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and tropes transformed through metaphysical specificity; synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking in lyrical, cosmic scale heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
