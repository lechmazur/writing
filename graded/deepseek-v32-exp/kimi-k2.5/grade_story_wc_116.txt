<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, and interiority is conveyed through poetic perception, but the character functions primarily as a thematic vessel. Lacks the contradictory impulses, flawed struggle, or visible cost of a more complex individual, though her final understanding is earned by the journey's accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative/textural lens with immediate orientation. Closure is a resonant Charged Poise ("carrying the obsidian's silence within her like a seed") that reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost—the acceptance of entropy and release of certainty. The pattern of shifting folds and decay teaches its logic and pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, vivid, and fully integrated. The overgrown library, obsidian refuge, and origami swan (as micro-setting) constrain choice, shape tactics, and decisively charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through the keeper's philosophical perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation occurs through density increase and a cadence shift at the refuge. The dominant stake (to witness without judgment) tightens into a decisive internal realization—"gripping reality loosely is the only way to hold it at all"—with a clear cost: the surrender of certainty and embrace of peaceful decay.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of transformation, entropy, and non-attachment emerges organically through concrete image and action, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final charged image, reweighting prior material with profound ambiguity and emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, meditative voice perfectly calibrated to the character's perception. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and purposeful compression (e.g., "the drift of untold seasons") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and highly efficient, with varied rhythm and sentence structure. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle or ornament. No loops, scaffold, or momentum drag. Line-level craft supports and elevates the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A fresh, singular synthesis of elements (library as decomposing organism, origami as living map, regenerative silence) that feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes and coherence without gimmickry, resulting in a memorable and authentic artistic stance.</comment>
