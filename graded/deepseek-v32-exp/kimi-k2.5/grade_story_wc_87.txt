<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias is a deeply realized character with contradictory impulses (merrily melancholic) shown in scene. His final renunciation of the compass is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with legible cost as he leaves the compass and accepts his terrestrial nature. Orientation is clear early.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Internal conflict escalates through the journey to a decisive renunciation; cost is unmistakable when he leaves the compass, foreclosing his celestial identity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of accepting brokenness emerges organically through particulars; final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and polished with few clichés; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is mostly fresh and supports pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concept of a navigator following utility poles is fresh and specific; synthesis feels inevitable, and emotional truth is nuanced.</comment>
