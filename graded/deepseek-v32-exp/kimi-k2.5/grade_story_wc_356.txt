<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's ambition and olfactorily sensitive nature are concrete, driving her to plant the seed despite the future suffering. Her final choice—endurance—is earned by the three-year search and the grandmother's wisdom, with visible cost. Interiority is specific and embodied, avoiding stock phrases. The only minor weakness is a slight explicitness in her epiphany, but it remains character-bound.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara accepts the cost of future stench, with cost legible on-page. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory detail to a cadence shift. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the turning of the tide's thought provides a coherent constraint that shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choice (doodles map to a specific hollow) and charging the final image (wildflower hush, golden song). Sensory detail is vivid and selective, filtered through Elara's olfactory sensitivity. The treetop village sways, pressuring her internal stillness, and the hollow's acidic soil is critical for planting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (successful planting and acceptance of suffering) tightens via the time-bound "turning of the tide's thought" and specific location. Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost unmistakable: her sensitive nose will endure decay scent. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (wisdom hidden in plain sight, endurance as medicine) emerges through concrete particulars—the doodles, seed's contradictions, and journalizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the scent/wisdom metaphor. Slight explicitness in reflection ("endurance itself was a form of medicine") is earned by character.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and closely filtered through Elara's sensory, reflective consciousness. Voice is distinct, poetic, and rhythmically controlled, with diction fitting her herbalist perspective. No head-hopping; perceptual signature (olfactory focus) is consistent and heightens pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly polished with varied syntax and strong information density. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Slight risk of overwriting ("olfactorily sensitive") is voice-motivated and consistent. Rhythm accelerates and breathes with scene needs, supporting closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar tropes (herbalist seeks rare plant) via unique elements: treetop village, olfactory sensitivity, doodle maps, and turning of the tide's thought. The combination feels organic and inevitable, with emotional specificity. Risk-taking in poetic prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
