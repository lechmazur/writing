<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and intensifies, driving her to actively reshape the prophecy. Interiority is concrete and embodied, though the lack of contradictory impulses in scene and the label “quietly inspired” keep it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with a decisive, resonant closure (sand falls upward, cliffs shift). Orientation is immediate, and cost is legible in the dissolution of the old order, though the positive transformation slightly mutes the felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The amber warehouse and buttons are vividly specific and essential, constraining choices and charging the final image of the warehouse as a lantern. Sensory detail is selective and deeply integrated with the protagonist’s perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early (collapse of the warehouse) and escalate through Elara’s agency, culminating in the jar’s shattering. The cost is conceptual—loss of the fixed prophecy—but lacks a visceral, felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions (buttons, echo, hourglass) and resonates in the final non-literal insight that “endings are merely buttons…” No moralizing, though the conclusion verges on explicit wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, but occasional tense shifts (“unravels” amid past tense) create minor inconsistency. No dialogue; perceptual signature is strong and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and largely free of loops or scaffolding. The tense inconsistency and occasional label-like phrasing (“quietly inspired”) prevent a higher score, though clarity and momentum remain strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of concepts (hourglass turner, button wisdom, canyon echo) feels inevitable in hindsight. Specific, irreplaceable details and a bold transformation of the prophecy elevate the piece without gimmickry.</comment>
