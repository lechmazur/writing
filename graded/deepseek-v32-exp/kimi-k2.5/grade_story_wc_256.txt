<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her training; her internal conflict between programmed itinerary and intuitive questioning is embodied in her micro-choices (touching the crystal, striking it). The final choice to stay and propagate sound is earned by prior causality. A slight abstraction in emotional labeling ("powerfully gentle" as a descriptor) prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the laboratory's purpose is reweighted from preservation to participation. Cost is legible in Elara's decision to remain, foreclosing her former path. The orientation is anchored immediately, and the pattern of fracture/resonance pays off cleanly at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The Laboratory is a micro-setting that actively constrains choice (the lens reveals fractures, the crystals store sound) and decisively charges the final image as sounds flow through the grid. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and fully integrated with POV perception and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (discovering true connection vs. completing a sanitized journey) escalate through Elara's agency—using the lens, noticing cracks, striking the pillar. Under the accumulative lens, this single meaningful deepening reweights options with cost: she bypasses security and commits to a new role. No coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of connection through fracture emerges organically from concrete particulars (the lens, the cracked crystal, the harmonic cascade). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the image of "fractured crystal vibrating in harmonic sympathy," avoiding any direct statement or moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptually specific voice filtered through Elara's professional expertise. The prose's rhythmic control supports pressure, and any elision (e.g., the city's algorithms) is purposeful and paid off in the closure's conceptual reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative but generally purposeful, advancing story and atmosphere. A minor tendency toward stacked modifiers ("complex, branching chord," "living tapestry of communal experience") creates slight density in peak beats without obscuring causality or closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a post-blackout sci-fi setting, mystical bell-ringer profession, and a miner's lens as diagnostic tool feels fresh and inevitable. The core risk—a quiet, conceptual climax where activation comes through questioning assumptions—heightens stakes and coheres fully with the thematic resolution.</comment>
