<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elio's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with theatrical sincerity. Interiority is concrete, and his final epiphany is earned through the frequency-tuning causality. However, contradictory impulses are minimal, limiting the depth of internal conflict under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in Elio's tears and whisper, reconfiguring the concept of empathy through a Conceptual Repricing. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with the locked diary and frequencies shaping tactics. Orientation is immediate, and causality is tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The workshop and diary clasp function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elio's obsession, with the resonating table and telescopes integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elio's agency in tuning frequencies, culminating in the master tone discovery that opens the diary. Cost is legible in his emotional response and the reweighted understanding of peace, all under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from silence and attunement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the opened diary. Subtext operates in gestures and frequencies, avoiding moralizing while earning insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, precise, and reflective of Elio's descriptive nature.
