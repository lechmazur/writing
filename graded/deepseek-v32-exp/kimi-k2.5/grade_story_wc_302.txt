<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in a lifelong quest; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion. Micro-choices under pressure reveal values, and the final archivist role is earned. However, contradictory impulses are not simultaneously active in scene, limiting peak complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens held; orientation clear early. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where she composes future silence, with cost legible in the weight of that responsibility. The backward-time constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and integral, constraining choice via the library's rules and the mist's deadline. The glowing library and propagation delays charge the final image of documentation, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map before expulsion) escalates via the six-hour clock and her agency with the watch. Cost is legible in her transformation into archivist, though the pressure remains quiet rather than confrontational.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken words and silence emerges through specific images (watch, mother's goodbye, jellyfish books). Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting her quest as composing future silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical perceptual signature. Voice filters through the dreamer's veil and watch, maintaining consistent distance and rhythm under pressure. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language is pattern-taught and coherent; no loops or scaffold obscuring closure. Peak beats remain clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of library of unspoken words, backward-time watch, and propagation delays. Premise is transformed through specific lived detail and emotional truth; risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
