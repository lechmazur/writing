<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's interiority is concrete and embodied ("their fingers found the cylinder... warm with the stored heat of anticipation"), and the final choice to document is motivated by a clear, consistent goal. However, some interior phrasing edges toward diagnostic label-speak ("righteous pursuit"), slightly abstracting the emotional core under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from setup to closure. The orientation is immediate, and the closure—copying the final symbols with the knowledge of the archivist's murder and the dynasty's imminent end—lands as a decisive change with clear conceptual and historical cost on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sepia reading room is not just atmosphere; it functions as a micro-setting whose properties (containing the resonator, holding the standing waves) constrain the action and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and fully filtered through Kael's urgent, professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering truth to end the dynasty) is signaled early and escalates through Kael's agential use of the resonator. The cost is legible in the recalled murder of the archivist and the weight of the revealed coordinates, tightening the stakes to a point of no return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus propaganda emerges organically through the specific mechanism of resonance and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the dynasty ends with "the quiet turning of a handle"—that reweights the prior imagery without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and confident, with a distinct perceptual signature ("the room itself seemed complicit in concealment"). The dense, rhythmic prose is voice-motivated and controlled, though its consistent elevation slightly limits modulation under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative but purposeful, with high information density and clear propulsion. A minor risk of overwriting ("the vanilla scent of aging deceit") is present but does not create coherent loops, obscure causality, or touch the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of resonant physics with archival rebellion is fresh and specific. The core concept feels indispensable, transforming a familiar "revolutionary" trope through grounded, tactile detail and a unique method of revelation that is fully committed to in the story's logic.</comment>
