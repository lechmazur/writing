<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and her motivation clear, driving proactive choices. Some abstract phrasing ("the timeframe of after strangers become family") leans toward telling, but her final understanding of the ghost's love is earned through prior causality with visible cost (the ghost's fading).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly; orientation is immediate. Closure is a decisive change (nebula created) with felt cost (ghost's departure) and a persistent constraint (ghost's chalk messages). The multi-shard structure is taught early and transitions are legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice—the floating arches and atmospheric moisture are essential to the plan. The watering bell as a micro-setting object charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survival) is signaled early; escalation is driven by Mara's agency (investigating, presenting, leading). The climax requires collective effort, narrowing options and paying a cost (the ghost's work ends), all under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of love and community emerges organically from images (ghost's messages, watering bell, nebula). The final line offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature. Elevated diction fits Mara's reflective voice; no head-hopping. The lyric compression of time is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm, but minor overwriting ("brambled hope" repeated) and a slightly convoluted sentence ("the timeframe of after strangers become family") prevent a perfect score. No loops or scaffold that harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sci-fi and ghost story feels fresh and inevitable. The ghost's altruism and the cultivated nebula are specific, grounded choices that heighten stakes without gimmickry. Risk-taking in genre blending pays off.</comment>
