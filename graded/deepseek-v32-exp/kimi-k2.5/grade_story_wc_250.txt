<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The guardian’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving all action, but the characterization is more symbolic than psychologically complex; interiority is present but abstract, lacking contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens is clear and held; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with conceptual cost—the darkness learns to value stars. Pattern taught early and paid off; orientation is immediate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly atmospheric and constrains choice (shutters, dock, canal) while charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and fully integrated into the guardian’s actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are abstract (teaching darkness) but escalation is driven by the guardian’s agency in weaving light patterns. Cost is subtle—felt in the patient effort and the changed relationship between light and dark.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silent empathy and reflection emerges organically from imagery and action; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with a distinct, poetic perceptual signature; voice is consistent and rhythmic, supporting the accumulative design without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with controlled rhythm; high information density and no figurative muddle. Some intentional repetition (“spiralingly calm,” “half-spoken secret”) does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis—a silent guardian using a dental mirror to teach darkness—feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in lyrical style and abstract theme pays off with authentic vision.</comment>
