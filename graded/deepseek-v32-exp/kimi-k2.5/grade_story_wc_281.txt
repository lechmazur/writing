<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Maya's affectionate skepticism is concretely embodied through contradictory impulses (doubt vs. compassion), driving micro-choices under pressure; her final softened skepticism is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the weight of her task and transformed hope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly; orientation is immediate; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with felt cost in the geode's cooling and "willowglass hope crystallizing," and the geode's constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The light painting studio and muscovite geode sliver are vivid, purpose-driven micro-settings that constrain choice (guiding search via somatic markers) and decisively charge the final image of light paintings as evidence and art.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recall pills to prevent damage) escalates through Maya's agency under the accumulative lens; cost is legible in somatic reactions and the emotional weight of mapping "geography of desperation," foreclosing false intimacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of connection without artificial means emerges through concrete particulars (geode, light paintings, pills) and subtext; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature focused on light and sensation; voice modulates rhythmically under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., fractal patterns) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language ("willowglass hope") is pattern-taught and serves closure, maintaining clarity and propulsion in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathy pill recall with somatic geode mapping feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric density and emotional specificity heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
