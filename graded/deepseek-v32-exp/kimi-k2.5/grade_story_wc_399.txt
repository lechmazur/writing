<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The line walker's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, but interiority is limited; we see little internal contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure, which keeps the score from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (echo stored, pavilion changed) with felt cost against the desert's hunger. Orientation is clear early, and the accumulative lens holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice (desert presses, clearing contracts), charging the final image. The kinetic parapet and pavilion are integral, but the high-band cap applies due to Q2.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (preserve echo) escalate through the desert's encroachment and the clearing's contraction. Protagonist agency (ritual, vulnerability) drives the tightening, with cost legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the ritual; the final image reweights prior material without moralizing. The idea that wisdom is kept by the earth's machinery resonates, but the high-band cap applies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature (peripheral awareness). POV is stable and the prose rhythm supports the ritualistic tone, capped due to Q2.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and free of loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clarity is maintained even at peak beats. High-band cap applies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of mystical elements (line walker, kinetic parapet, conjured clearings) feels fresh and organic. Risk-taking in lyrical prose pays off, but the high-band cap applies.</comment>
