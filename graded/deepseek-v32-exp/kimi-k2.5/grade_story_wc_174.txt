<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s characterization is a profound strength. His interior contradiction—the urbane calligrapher convinced of his ethical exploration while actually mastering manipulation—is concretely embodied in his actions (carving the stick, recording performances). His epiphany and subsequent choice to burn his tools are earned by the prior causality of the argument and the blind woman's story, culminating in a resonant Earned Stasis with visible cost (the ashes). The micro-choice to offer the stick and ask for a story reveals a complete hierarchy shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal drive lens is clear and held: argument → epiphany in the dome → decisive act of surrender → climactic burning. Closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Marcus’s intent reverses from exploration to restoration, foreclosing his manipulative path with the visceral cost of the fire’s ashes. The final image ("finally silent in the way a meteor is silent...") is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the entire premise. Cost is legible on-page in the act of destruction and the transformed serenity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome is indispensable, not a backdrop. Its "geometric ribs" and history as a transmitter of fictions directly mirror Marcus’s role and charge the final image. It constrains choice (isolation for epiphany, concrete floor for the fire). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("breath visible in the chilled air," "Edison bulb...half-lit chamber"). The "campfire story stick" functions as a micro-setting object that evolves from tool of record to fuel for transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ethical integrity of storytelling) is signaled early. Escalation is driven entirely by Marcus's agency under the causal lens: his realization that he must "become the audience" forces the climactic choice to surrender and burn. The cost is unmistakable and paid on-page: the destruction of his tools and scripts, the tangible loss of his former identity and project. The tightening is meaningful and forecloses his prior path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from concrete particulars without statement. The central question of ethical storytelling is answered through the resonant, non-literal image of the burning stick and the meteor's silence. Subtext is rich (the blind storyteller's tale mirrors Marcus's; the radar dome's history). Epiphanies are earned through dramatized struggle. The ending offers profound ambiguity (will he burn or strike?) that lingers without confusion, a perfect Conceptual Repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable, deep, and character-specific. The prose has a distinct, perceptive texture that reflects Marcus's calligraphic precision and crumbling self-deception ("rearranged listeners' memories like furniture in a dark room"). Psychic distance is expertly controlled, moving from embodied immediacy to reflective depth. The single line of dialogue ("Tell me something true") is perfectly weighted and pivotal. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with excellent rhythmic control. However, minor overwriting in a peak beat slightly impacts clarity: "the reverse motion not of tape or time, but of intent" introduces a slight abstraction. A single instance of potentially mixed metaphor ("enters his bloodstream like a toxin or a sacrament") is voice-consistent but momentarily stalls forward pressure. No loops or scaffolding; sentence-level craft is otherwise exceptional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis is singular and feels inevitable: a Cold War radar dome, a calligrapher-puppeteer, and a campfire story stick converge to explore narrative ethics with startling originality. The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious angle. Emotional truth and specificity are high. Risk-taking (lyric compression, the blind storyteller shard) heightens stakes and coheres perfectly. The story commits fully to its implications.</comment>
