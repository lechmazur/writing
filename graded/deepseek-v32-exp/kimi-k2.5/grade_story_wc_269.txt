<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and deeply rooted, with embodied interiority and a credible micro-choice (sending the atlas page) that reveals her values under pressure. The final renunciation is earned by the accumulative data work and reflection, with visible cost in the delayed understanding. No contradictory impulses are overtly dramatized in scene, but her persistent fixation and eventual release carry weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the atlas page recontextualized as a "record of witness" and the realization that paths disappear through social forgetting. Cost is legible in the final lines linking grief to understanding. Orientation is immediate, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the station's "drifting moored" state shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The converted monitoring station is integral, constraining choice via isolation and archive, while the atlas page and the "periodically eternal" tide charge the closure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elena's professional perspective. The setting evolves consistently, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding why paths disappear) tightens through Elena's active assembly of data cores and the delayed revelation. Escalation is driven by her agency under the accumulative lens, culminating in the decision to transmit the page with a felt cost. The revelation forecloses the passive-observation path and reweights the stakes toward memory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars—bleaching, atlas page, data gaps—culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer: navigation requires living memory. Subtext operates through image and implication (tapping, station's drift). No moralizing; the ending offers complexity about social forgetting and delayed grief without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature blending scientific precision and reflective melancholy. Voice modulates rhythmically (tapping echoed in prose) and maintains lexical control under pressure. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (data gaps) pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without overwriting; sentences vary in length and rhythm, advancing story and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Information density is high, with every line doing multiple jobs. Minor quibble: "periodically eternal" is slightly reiterated but serves pattern.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of climate-change aftermath with memory and navigation, transforming the "delayed revelation" trope through specific, grounded choices. The atlas page and data cores feel organic; the perspective is memorable. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
