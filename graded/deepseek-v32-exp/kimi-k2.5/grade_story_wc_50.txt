<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through precise action, earning the closure with visible cost. However, lacks contradictory impulses in scene, limiting peak complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with cost ("trembling hands," walls exhaling); Accumulative/Textural lens holds tightly; persistent constraint of fractured cavern shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Marble cavern and timer mechanism constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (restoring echo harvest) escalate via Elias's agency under Accumulative lens; cost is legible on page as risk of losing the cavern's soul.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of storing wonder in reason emerges through concrete action and image; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (peripheral focus, light angles); voice is consistently lyrical and precise, matching character's mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and artifact-free; high information density with no loops or figurative muddle obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of echo harvesting and temporal physics; risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
