<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Julian's synesthetic ghost nature and motivation to help Mara are clear and consistent, driving the story; Mara's despair and change are earned through concrete actions. The transfer of potential at closure carries visible cost (coin given, box cutter left). Minor weakness: Mara's interiority is less detailed, but her choice is legible under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Mara takes the coin and leaves, reconfiguring Julian's existence; orientation is immediate; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory echoes and timeline fracture. The tarot coin as persistent constraint shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful—the maze and orchard filter through Julian's synesthesia, constraining choice and charging the finale; the tarot coin functions as micro-setting that bridges realities. Sensory detail is selective and integrated, avoiding generic placeholder syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Mara's despair vs. Julian's intervention) escalates through accumulative echoes and visions; agency rests with Julian's singing and coin use, leading to Mara's decisive change. Cost is unmistakable on-page (coin transferred, tool abandoned).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transferred potential and eternal resonance emerges through particulars (coin, echoes, garden) without moralizing; the ending offers a non-literal answer via the coin waiting for the next soul. Subtext operates in imagery and action, avoiding explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Julian, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by synesthesia; voice is poetic and controlled, with rhythmic prose that heightens pressure. No head-hopping or dialogue issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or artifacts that obscure closure; figurative language is pattern-taught (synesthesia) and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost story, synesthesia, and fractured timeline feels organic and inevitable; risk-taking with poetic prose heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core concept is transformed through specific character and setting details.</comment>
