<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with eroded ambitions and regret embodied through trembling hands and translucent transformation. Her micro-choices under pressure—collecting fragments, extending the camera wheel, confessing—reveal a hierarchy of values. The final trade with her ghost is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost as she grows light and the ghost solidifies. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression is credible and complex.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (trade between Mara and her ghost) with on-page cost ("Mara grew light and translucent"). The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through fragments and images to the decisive moment. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (who, where, when after the carousel halted). Persistent constraint of fractured time shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon and disposable camera wheel constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (violet mist, creak of cooling metal). Setting mirrors internal states (fractured stillness, spirals defying physics) and is woven through action. Spatial choreography is coherent, with the carousel's center as the negotiation point.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (negotiating with her ghost for wholeness) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative lens: she collects fragments, the ghost rejects them, demanding her regret, leading to confession. Cost is legible in the transfer of solidity and transparency. One meaningful tightening (the ghost's rejection) forces a higher-stakes choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of regret and time emerges through concrete images and events, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: eroded ambitions transformed into fertile ground, regret into dormant seeds. Subtext operates in the ghost's dialogue and the final image. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in chronological confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV (Mara) is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, biased, noticing spirals and fragments. Voice modulates with emotional intensity without head-hopping. Rhythmic control under pressure, e.g., "She opened her mouth and let the years pour out." Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext and advances the negotiation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, accelerating in confession and slowing in the final image. Read-aloud rhythm is strong, with purposeful syntax and specific, vivid diction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of surreal setting, sound-collecting scavenger, and negotiation with one's own ghost feels inevitable and organic. Emotional truth is specific; risk-taking in accumulative structure and poetic voice heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise is transformed through grounded character choices and a non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>
