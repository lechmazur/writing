<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's guilt and redemption are concretely embodied; his shift from burden to purpose is earned by the discovery. The repairman is functional but slightly archetypal, limiting depth, but the quick test is met with contradictory impulses and visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight; orientation is immediate; closure is a decisive change with legible cost (the weight of seventeen years). The repairman's prophecy is neat but does not break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vivid and integral; the storm and light break constrain choice and charge the final image. The clockwork heart as micro-setting is indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redemption/justice) escalates through the discovery; agency lies with Elias, and cost is visible. External conflict is off-page but acceptable at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of second opinions and redemption emerges organically; subtext is strong in imagery and dialogue. The ending reweights prior material without moralizing, though one line verges on over-signaling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinctive; voice is lyrical and reflective of Elias's contemplation. No head-hopping; dialogue serves plot, though the repairman's speech is slightly archaic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished with varied rhythm and high density; figurative language is purposeful. Minor repetition of "aptly deliberate" but no loops or artifacts that harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanism and mercy; the clockwork heart as both condemning and exonerating feels inevitable. Execution is crafted, though not groundbreaking.</comment>
