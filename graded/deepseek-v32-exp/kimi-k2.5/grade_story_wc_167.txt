<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion (the decision turning "like glass against the grinding wheel"). His final endurance (Earned Stasis) is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the recalled divorce, estrangement, and trembling hands. However, contradictory impulses are more summarized than simultaneously acted upon in scene, limiting the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elias perceives "the value in the asking," with cost legible in the "rings expanding from central wounds." The accumulative/textural lens holds firmly, and orientation is anchored early. The persistent constraint of his life's fractures shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly selective and purposeful ("tide pool still as mercury," "prism atrium like a crystal lung"). The tide pool and atrium constrain choice (the stone-casting) and decisively charge the final image ("prism atrium blaze into full rainbow brilliance"), satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (illuminating value in a fractured life) escalates through accumulative density driven by Elias's agency (casting the stone, reading the ripples). Cost is unmistakable in the interference patterns of "joy and regret." A single meaningful tightening suffices, though the escalation is more contemplative than actively narrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars (glass, ripples, light) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: light reveals true colors "through pressure and density." The final image reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature (the glazier's eye for "cracks" and "structural truths"). Lyrical, controlled prose modulates with emotional intensity, and any elision (e.g., the method's origin) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("horizon still bled violet into grey"). Sentences advance story and atmosphere with clear propulsion, even in peak reflective beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of glazier, prism atrium, and ripple mechanics feels fresh and inevitable. Specific, verifiable detail (salt-scarred warehouses, atmospheric ice crystals) anchors universals. Risk-taking in lyrical density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, though the reflective mode is familiar.</comment>
