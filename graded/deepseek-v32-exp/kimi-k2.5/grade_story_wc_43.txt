<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elena's decisively kind intervention and Maya's shift from weapon to need are embodied and earned. Contradictory impulses act in scene, and the final reunification through the broken record carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orientation clear early; accumulative/textural lens holds. Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the broken record's meaning is reconfigured with felt cost in the final image, and persistent constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting—the cloudhaven—and object—the broken record—constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details (scent of hope, light, sound) are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (flawless goodbye) escalates through density increase under accumulative lens. Elena's hymning and Maya's agency drive the turn, with cost legible in the acceptance of brokenness, satisfying the quick test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in brokenness emerges from particulars—the record, hymning, scent—without moralizing. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the record held to the heart, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical and controlled, with stable POV shifts at paragraph breaks under Track C. Perceptual signature distinct, rhythm varies with pressure, no head-hopping; elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and clear propulsion. No loops or scaffold; figurative language coherent and purposeful, supporting the accumulative design without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hospice narrative with lyrical accumulation. Risk-taking in style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the broken record concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with +0.3 for risk distinction.</comment>
