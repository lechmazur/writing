<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as a "creeping normality noticer" is concretely embodied in her observations and guerrilla gardening; her internal drive to find the sacred in the ordinary anchors consistent micro-choices, culminating in the decision to uncloak her project. The final choice to share the bread pudding is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the fragility of the garden and memory. Minor deduction for a lack of contradictory impulses in scene, but her steadfast gentleness is character-specific and pressures the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: pattern of noticing, gardening, and sharing builds to a Conceptual Repricing where absolution is reconfigured as a practice. Closure lands on-page with felt cost in the "tenuous absolution" and the neighborhood's new vigilance. Orientation is immediate; the single narrative arc tightens meaningfully at the uncloaking, and the final image reweights prior material without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the overgrown palace courtyard and secret tea house constrain Mara's guerrilla gardening and supply the resources for the climax. Sensory details (rusted gate, wisteria, anise scent) are selective and filtered through her POV, charging the final image of pumpkin vines on ancient walls. The environment actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a density increase: Mara's solitary cultivation deepens into shared offering, reweighting the stake of resisting loss. Protagonist agency drives the turn (uncloaking, baking), and cost is legible in the transformed bread and the garden's fragility. One meaningful tightening—from private ritual to communal revelation—forecloses the option of secrecy with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete actions (gardening, baking) and images (bread as relic, garden as sanctuary). Subtext operates in gesture and silence among the tea-house regulars. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—absolution as daily practice—without moralizing; the line "tenuous absolution" is earned by the preceding dramatization and carries conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited to Mara is stable and apt; voice is distinctly lyrical and observant, matching her perceptual signature. Syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional pressure (e.g., the gentle cadence of gardening vs. the crystallized closure). No head-hopping; minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven. The voice's texture supports the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and rhythmic control; sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("hard as ceramic but still smelling faintly of anise and memory") is consistent and purposeful. No artifacts obscure causality or closure; line-level propulsion matches the quiet intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of guerrilla gardening, lost bakery, and secret tea house feels organic and inevitable. The perspective—a noticer cultivating absolution—is memorable and specific. Risk-taking in quiet, reflective tone heightens stakes without gimmickry; the core premise is transformed through lived detail and a non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>
