<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Characterization is concrete and earned; Maya's desire to learn the building's language drives credible choices, and her final act of bringing her own seal is motivated by prior lessons. The revelation of Elias's death is stated rather than dramatized, a minor slip that doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (Maya completes the building's sentence) and resonant reconfiguration; cost is legible in the bricks rearranging to include her name. The hybrid (accumulative/causal) lens holds, and orientation is anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is integral: the building's architectural details and the rooftop garden during meteor showers pressure choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Maya's perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maya's agency under the accumulative lens; her desire to learn tightens through weekly lessons, culminating in the irreversible act of sealing her name into the building's mortar with a visible, felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—agreed upon lies, dead languages, architectural grammar—and resolves in a non-literal, resonant image that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct; voice is lyrical and precise, with a perceptual signature that filters the world through linguistic and architectural metaphor. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, accelerating toward the closure image without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost story, linguistic mystery, and architectural obsession feels inevitable in hindsight. Specific, grounded details (desk seal, meteor showers) heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
