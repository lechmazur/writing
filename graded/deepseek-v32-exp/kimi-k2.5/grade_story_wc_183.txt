<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies; interiority is concrete but internal conflict is more summarized than dramatized in scene. Final choice to accept trapped freedom is earned with visible cost, though contradictory impulses could be more active on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing: acceptance of trapped freedom reweights identity with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; orientation is clear early; constraint of narrative threads shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting vividly pressures choices via drifting ship and memory-altered architecture; recurring objects (swatch card, threads) constrain action and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Maya's agency weaving narrative threads, leading to acceptance of trapped freedom. Cost is legible on-page; dominant stake (recapturing narrative) tightens under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from imagery and action; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through "weave what remained." Subtext in garden and unkindled solace avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is selective and rhythmic control heightens pressure. No head-hopping; elision (narrative threads) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative but consistent, advancing story with high information density. Minor overwriting in peaks fits pattern; no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Rhythm supports propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chimera twin, carnival, and narrative threads; risk-taking in lyrical structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
