<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's grim optimism is embodied through contradictory impulses (smiling while bleeding) and micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation to capture a missed opportunity drives the narrative, and the final choice to use the dice is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the closure image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a conceptual repricing where stepping through the fissure reweights the missed opportunity with felt cost. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the staircase shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The infinite staircase functions as micro-setting that constrains every choice and charges the final image with the texture of the brass handle. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's perception, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing missed opportunity) escalates through Elara's agency in writing mathematical proofs and using the chipped die. Under the accumulative lens, pressure tightens to a single decisive turn where cost is legible in the rupture and final grasp.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of infinity, imperfection, and regret, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer via the captured texture. Subtext is woven through the dice and proofs, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice modulates poetically under pressure, and purposeful compression (e.g., "chronology dissolved") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without artifacts harming closure. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with no loops or scaffold; sentence-level propulsion accelerates toward the rupture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of infinite staircase, mathematical escape, and existential regret feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure image is uniquely charged.</comment>
