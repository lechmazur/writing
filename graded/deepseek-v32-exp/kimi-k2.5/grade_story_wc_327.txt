<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and drives the plot; interiority embodied through copper veins and sensory perceptions; final choice earned by prior causality with visible cost in diamond's transformation. Contradictory impulses are subtle but constrained by quiet articulation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal linkages tight; closure lands with decisive change and conceptual cost (curse dissolved, language as resonance); orientation immediate; lens held consistently; persistent constraint of dying language shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is integral to conflict and closure; bone towers and canyon echoes constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details selective and purposeful; environment acts as micro-setting that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of language preservation escalates through time pressure; protagonist's agency in deciphering patterns and using acoustics leads to cost-legible resolution; one meaningful tightening with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of language dissolution and preservation emerges organically; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through image of sound becoming resonance; no moralizing; subtext in curse redirection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable; voice distinct with poetic rhythm and perceptual signature tied to sound and metal; elision taught and paid off; no head-hopping; diction consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose dense and lyrical with high information density; no loops or scaffold; figurative language consistent and purposeful; propulsion maintains momentum; rhythm varies with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable; fresh angle on language preservation through acoustic magic and cursed artifact; risk-taking in lyrical approach heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
