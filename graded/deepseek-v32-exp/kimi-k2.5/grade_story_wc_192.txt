<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characters are deeply motivated with embodied emotions; Elias's sacrifice and Mira's return feel earned. The final choice—teaching through scars—is rooted in prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Mira's autonomous breath) under an accumulative/textural lens; cost is legible in Elias's solitude and the fading threshold.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting functions as micro-setting: the ashen sanctuary and scars constrain choice and charge the final image with tangible pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (suffocation vs. breathing) escalates through protagonist agency in the transmission scene; cost is unmistakable in the separation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of sacrificial love and autonomy emerges organically through scars and thresholds; ending offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Poetic, consistent third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature; voice modulates with emotional pressure and no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dense, rhythmic prose with high information density; no loops or figurative muddle, and closure remains clear despite lyrical intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of healing tropes through specific imagery (scars, bridges); risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
