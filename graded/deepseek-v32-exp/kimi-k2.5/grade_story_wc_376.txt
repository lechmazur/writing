<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Aurelia's motivation is clear and intensified by the unique leaf trait, which drives key choices. Her relationship with Marcus provides a crucible for honesty, though internal conflict is minimal for the scope. The final transformation of her leaves is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (thriving leaves in the vault) and felt cost (journey risk, wilting). Causal lens holds tightly from search to discovery. Orientation is anchored early, and the zinc plates as keys provide a persistent constraint that shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and immersive, with the greenhouse city and toxic sky actively pressuring choices. Sensory details are woven through action, and the leaves, plates, and vault function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rebuilding trust through lost conversations) is signaled early and escalates via Aurelia's agency. The encounter with Marcus tightens options, and the cost is legible in the leaf wilting and subsequent transformation. Escalation is driven under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth and communication emerges organically from concrete events and images. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the sanctuary of letters and thriving leaves, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with a lyrical third-person POV filtered through Aurelia's perception. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is strong and maintains coherence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with varied rhythm and high information density. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and atmosphere efficiently. Line-level craft supports closure without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality is high with a fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic, truth-detecting, and archival elements. Specific details like gilded leaves and zinc plates are indispensable and feel inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
