<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Caretaker's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority embodied in actions and "foxglove regret." Final endurance earned by prior causality with visible cost on the page; contradictory impulses act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with charged poise (Resonant Reconfiguration) under accumulative lens; cost legible in tube's destruction and regret. Orientation clear within first 120 words; causality tight from discovery to illumination.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting integral to choices and final image; library's failed illumination drives action; sensory details selective and purposeful through POV. Environment constrains tactics and charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preservation escalates through protagonist's agency; cost visible in sacrifice and temporary beauty. Escalation driven by caretaker's realization and action under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from events and images; ending offers resonant answer without moralizing through "foxglove regret" and continued care. Subtext operates in implication and charged imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV stable; voice distinct with lyrical perceptual signature and rhythmic control. No head-hopping; elision taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose dense and poetic with varied rhythm; high information density without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language consistent and clear; clarity maintained in peak illumination beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis feels inevitable; unique elements like glass orchids and bamboo tube organic. Emotional specificity avoids templates; risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
