<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interior contradiction (fear vs. duty) and the shadow's silent struggle are embodied through specific micro-choices, such as walking backwards and the hammer poised. Her final decision to wait is earned by the tea-leaf readings, and the cost of mentorship is visible in her "ferocious love." No diagnostic label-speak; traits drive the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: because the tea leaves show resilience, Elara delays; because the shadow signals readiness, she shatters the exile. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—the swing stills, and both step forward. Orientation is immediate; constraints (shard, tea leaves) shape tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The forgotten library and empty playground swing are selective, sensory details that constrain choice (ritual space) and charge the final image. The swing's recurrence from opening to closing reweights the stake of exile and return, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shadow's resilience) escalates through Elara's agency under the causal lens: her challenge, the hammer poised, and the shadow's reach. Cost is legible in the "trembling" step and Elara's conquered fear. One meaningful tightening—the deferred break—forecloses easy escape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of resilience through "cruelest kindness" emerges from particulars—tea-leaf geometry, backward walking, the swing—without moralizing. The final image of two archives stepping forward offers a resonant, non-literal answer to exile and mentorship.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Elara's perceptual signature ("hour settle into her bones like a bruise"). Voice is distinct, rhythmic, and modulates with pressure; dialogue carries subtext ("Fear is the first lesson"). No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; lines like "combative tenderness" are character-apt. Sentence-level craft supports peak beats without obscuring causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy (shard-mirror archivist, reversible exile) with psychological depth through specific, irreplaceable elements (tea-leaf geometry, backward walking). Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable from established pattern.</comment>
