<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maya's characterization is deeply textured and consistent, with interior contradiction embodied in her scars and the "currency she had paid in full." Her final choice to give the marble is a micro-choice revealing a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Elias is a credible secondary pressure. A minor deduction for the slightly abstract phrasing "arithmetic of loss," which borders on diagnostic label-speak in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The final image of the "empty box lighter now" and the reconfiguration of her pain from penance to shared language lands with undeniable felt cost. Orientation is immediate, and the single-scene structure with integrated reflection is flawless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is not just vivid but essential. The ridge path is the chosen ground for the confrontation, the "cracked porcelain box" is a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the closure, and the celestial bodies provide a framing constraint. Sensory detail is selective and powerfully filtered through Maya's professional and traumatized perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—translating private anguish into communal understanding—escalates cleanly through Maya's agency under the Accumulative lens. Her decision to speak and then give the marble is a meaningful, cost-bearing deepening that forecloses her path of solitary penance. The price is legible in the empty box and her aching scars.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the concretes of the box, the marble, and the scars. The concept of "bargained innocence" and "translating pain" is earned through specific, wrenching detail, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "two scarred souls learning... the price of fluency."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally controlled and distinct, a close third-person deeply fused with Maya's poetic, wounded perception. The lyrical density is pattern-taught from the first line and maintained under pressure. Dialogue is sparse but natural and heavy with subtext. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a touch of overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "the hard softness of weathered granite," "becoming syntax") which creates a slight figurative pile-up without obscuring causality or closure. Otherwise, sentence-level propulsion is masterful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of firefighter trauma, cosmic scale, and a small, charged object (the marble) feels fresh and inevitable. The lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes and coherence. The core premise is transformed through intense emotional specificity and a non-obvious resolution that privileges shared understanding over rescue.</comment>
