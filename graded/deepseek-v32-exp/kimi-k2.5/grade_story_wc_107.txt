<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character's contemplative nature and dramatic self-narration are embodied through specific, consistent micro-choices. Her decision to leave is earned by the thaw's pressure, with visible cost in abandoning the sanctuary and spheres. Interiority is concrete (e.g., thumb tracing the bookmark) without stock phrasing, though internal contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she exits, leaving spheres behind. Cost is legible in "Exit, pursued by spring" and the spheres as "frozen prayers finally answered." Orientation is clear within 120 words. Persistent constraint of thawing ice shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the abandoned control room and melting glacier pressure her choice to leave and supply the ice core samples. Vivid sensory detail (frost-laced window, dripping radio mast) is filtered through her professional perception. Environment constrains choice and charges the final image of spheres glinting on consoles.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (crafting sanctuaries before the thaw tightens) escalates via the advancing melt, narrowing options to a forced departure. Protagonist agency drives the deepening: she chooses to place the bookmark and leave, with cost visible in relinquished refuge. One meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens, but agency is more endurance than active confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of preserving wonder amid inevitable change emerges through concrete particulars (glass spheres, bookmark, narrated ceremony). Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the image of spheres as "frozen prayers" and her exit "pursued by spring." No moralizing; subtext operates in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: lyrical, reflective, blending glassblower's precision with dramatic self-narration. Voice modulates with emotional intensity (e.g., "weighty lightness"). No head-hopping; purposeful elision (e.g., past discovery of bookmark) is anchored and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and rhythmically controlled without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "grammar of drips and cracks"). High information density; sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific: glassblower on a glacier preserving ice-core air in glass spheres. Synthesis of elements feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Closure image recharges prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
