<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's defiance and subsequent surrender are embodied through concrete micro-choices (switching to raw lines) and a visible cost (voice fading). The relationship with Lira acts as a crucible, forcing the change. The final renunciation is earned by the realization that truth must be changed by others, though the shift is slightly rapid given the length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds via echo accumulation, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the ritual fails and paths multiply. Orientation is immediate, closure lands with cost on the page ("voice fading, becoming part of the bone"). No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: bone towers and canyon are tactile, filter perception, and actively constrain choice by refracting sound. The pale spire's rotation supplies time pressure. The final image of towers humming is charged by the environment, which reweights the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preventing a locked history) is signaled early and tightens via the spire's glow. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency—Kael's shift to raw lines and Lira's intervention—under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in Kael's voice fading, foreclosing the path of pure narrative control.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme (forgiveness as surrender of narrative purity) emerges through concrete action and image, not just statement. The final reconfiguration—truth refracted into infinite possibilities—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor deduction for the slightly on-the-nose realization paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Kael's poetic perception. Voice is distinct, lyrical, and modulates with pressure (e.g., "forged hush"). No head-hopping; dialogue is sparse but natural. Rhythmic control supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with figurative language that serves the concept. Sentences vary in length and structure, accelerating with the ritual's approach. No loops, scaffolding, or register drift. Closure image is sharp and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and fully committed: the refraction of truth through echo and poetry resists singular history. The synthesis of setting, character, and theme feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
