<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character is vividly conceived through interior meditation and embodied stasis, but lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene, keeping it from the highest band. Final renunciation is earned via patience and observation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing with clear cost (becoming a landmark). Orientation is immediate, and the arrowhead's pulse shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable—bone towers and canyon pressure the skimmer's stillness and charge the final realization. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and fully integrated with POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (navigate without moving) escalate through density of reflection and observation; cost is legible in the skimmer's transformation into permanent stasis, driven by his agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of stillness as travel emerges organically from images and realization; ending reweights prior material without moralizing, offering resonant, non-literal closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is consistently poetic and meditative, with a distinct perceptual signature. POV is stable, and rhythmic control supports the accumulative drive without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density; figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off. No loops or scaffold that obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and risk-taking—a meditative sage in a bone canyon—synthesized into a coherent, inevitable whole. Specificity and conceptual integrity elevate without gimmickry.</comment>
