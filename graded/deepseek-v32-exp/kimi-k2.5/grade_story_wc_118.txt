<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and driven by her "sensitively perceptive" trait, with embodied emotion (tears on the tapestry) and micro-choices under pressure (probing, reading, weeping). Her final action to read aloud is earned by prior discoveries, but internal conflict is minimal, limiting higher-band reach.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara reads aloud, with cost legible in her tears and the wall's mnemonic shudder. Orientation is clear early, and the displaced axis constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (silo library) and object (tapestry fragment) constrain choice and charge the final image—the silo "waits" for her voice, the tapestry's dragon eye "watches." Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through Elara's perception, supporting the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collecting wall stories) escalates via density increase under accumulative lens: discovery of tapestry deepens knowledge, and Elara's agency (working through night, reading aloud) reweights stakes with visible cost (tears, wall shudder). Tightening is meaningful but not causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (memory, loss, storytelling) emerges organically from particulars like the axis shift and tapestry; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through image and action ("translating walls into words, dragons into deliverance") without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—Elara's sensitive perception filters description. Voice is lyrical and consistent ("bronze quiet"), with rhythmic control and purposeful compression; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density, varied rhythm, and zero loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and clear ("amber light," "dragon's eye a single knot of crimson"); sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative texture without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic memory loss with axis shift and medieval tapestry feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details (silo library, dragons as axis) transform tropes.</comment>
