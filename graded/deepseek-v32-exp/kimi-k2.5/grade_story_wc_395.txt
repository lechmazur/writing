<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and deepens under pressure, driving high-stakes choices. However, interiority occasionally slips into diagnostic summary ("sensed absence pressing against her chest") rather than fully embodied contradiction under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal/Hybrid lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant Conceptual Repricing ("nothing is ever truly deleted") with clear cost (exposed corporate lie, survivors found). Orientation is immediate; the thread from patch to numbers to rescue is tightly linked.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("digital snow," "patch against velvet"). The archive setting pressures choices, but the micro-setting (quantum server core) doesn't concretely constrain the final confrontation, capping the score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from personal quest to corporate conspiracy to rescue mission under the Hybrid lens. Each turn is driven by Elara's agency (discovering patch, decoding numbers, broadcasting truth), with cost legible in the exposure and systemic revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of digital immortality and the haunting of abandoned data emerges organically from concrete particulars (deleted photos, forgotten songs, archived astronauts). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with a perceptual signature tuned to digital ephemera. POV is stable single-focus. Some phrases edge toward ornate register ("palpable void where connection had once existed") but remain legible and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally dense and propelled, but shows minor artifacts: repetitive stems ("forgotten songs" used twice in one sentence) and a near-paraphrase loop ("digital ephemera"/"digital snow"/"digital fossils". These do not touch the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes digital archaeology and space mystery in a fresh, specific way. The core conceit (data migration as preservation) is fully committed to and yields a non-obvious, earned closure. The corporate conspiracy angle is slightly familiar.</comment>
