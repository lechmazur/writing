<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with concrete interiority and micro-choices that reveal her values. The final transformation to "curator of liminal experiences" is earned by prior causality, though a slight abstractness in her epiphany prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing ("the only escape came through surrendering to the storm") with felt cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is immediate, transitions are seamless, and the seed's growth persistently tightens the narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposefully integrated; the greenhouse and brook constrain choice and charge the final image. The corpse flower seed evolves from object to conceptual framework, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safeguarding innovation) escalates through Maya's agency, culminating in a visible cost—her dedicated labor and commercial risk. The tightening is coherent under the accumulative lens, though the escalation relies more on reflection than active confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the corpse flower metaphor, offering a resonant, non-literal answer about innovation through surrender. Subtext is rich in imagery, avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that mirrors Maya's creative mind. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., time jumps) is taught and paid off. Diction remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density, but slight overwriting ("storm-born silence" repeated) and figurative stacking in peak beats create minor artifacts that slightly dull momentum, though clarity remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of escape-room design, botany, and cryptography feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise is transformed through specific, grounded detail.</comment>
