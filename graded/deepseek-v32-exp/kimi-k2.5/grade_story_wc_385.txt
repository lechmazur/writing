<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her "richly perceptive" trait, with interiority shown through embodied perception (e.g., "ached with the weight"). Her final choice—to honor the Echoed Ones—is earned by the causal revelation and carries visible cost in her acceptance of her sister's fate. The decision is a credible renunciation that forecloses a path of exploitation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mira's decision crystallizes and she sings her sister home, with cost legible in the burden she assumes. The Causal lens holds tightly: her actions with the seashell lead to the Archivists' revelation and her choice. Orientation is anchored early (who, where, when) and the persistent constraint of the seashell shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is integral, with the serpentine nexus and starlight filtering down creating atmospheric pressure that guides Mira's movement and the shell's use. The whispering seashell half functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding why her sister echoes) is signaled early and tightens through Mira's agency—using the shell, confronting Archivists—culminating in a decisive choice that forecloses exploitation. Escalation is driven by her actions under the Causal lens, with cost unmistakable in her acceptance of the preservation truth and new responsibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (preservation vs. consent, memory as seed) emerges organically from concrete events and images (seashell, echoes, canyon). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mira's decision to bridge "echo became choice, not capture," without moralizing. Subtext operates in the Archivists' withheld consent and Mira's reconciled melancholy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature in Mira's "richly perceptive" filtering of the world. Voice is consistently poetic and controlled, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without overwriting; sentences vary rhythmically and advance story momentum. No paraphrase loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; information density is high. The final image ("she began to sing her sister home") is clear and resonant, with no artifacts obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of geological consciousness preservation, acoustic ritual, and personal quest. The concept is transformed through specific, grounded details (seashell, canyon nexus) and Mira's emotional stake. Turns feel earned in hindsight; the story commits fully to its implications without retreat.</comment>
