<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Maya's contradictory impulses—rejecting the clone versus accepting it—are dramatized in scene, and her final choice to integrate is earned by the brain's complementary-opposites teaching, with visible cost in her tears and the rock's stabilization. The ego death survivor's emotional numbness is embodied through concrete sensation (e.g., "cheeks that had forgotten sensation"), and her micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: jar arrival triggers internal conflict, realization of synthesis, and decisive act of opening, all linked by because/therefore logic. Closure is a Decisive Change (integration and weeping) with legible cost on the page: "Maya wept... and in that wetness she recognized victory over the numbness." Orientation is clear within 120 words; the floating rock dojo and rewriting history serve as persistent constraints that shape the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo and rewriting world are vivid, selective sensory details that charge the final image (the rock stabilizes as internal conflict resolves). The jar and brain function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice and pressure tactics. Sensory hierarchy reflects Maya's narrowed perception under crisis, then expands with integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defeat emotional numbness) is signaled early and escalates through Maya's agency: the jar's arrival creates conflict, the brain's pulses demand vivification, and her realization of synthesis forces a costly choice. Escalation is driven by protagonist decisions under the causal lens, with unmistakable cost in the integration and weeping.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of synthesis over singularity emerges from events and images (the label DUPLICATE becomes liberation) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the hollow reed and settled history, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, e.g., the brain's method of complementary opposites teaching.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature: poetic, philosophical voice that modulates with emotional intensity (e.g., "hollow bell that had already cracked"). Purposeful compression and patterned elision (history rewriting) are taught early and pay off at closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "sliced through pretense like a blade through silk"). Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with conflict and breathes at resolution. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ego death, clone custody battle, and surreal setting feels organic and inevitable. The premise offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on identity and rebirth, transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and stakes. Risk-taking in abstract concepts is fully integrated, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
