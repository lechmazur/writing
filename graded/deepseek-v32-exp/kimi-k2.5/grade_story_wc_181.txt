<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's bewilderment and realization are concretely embodied through the pistachio shell and her reflections. Her final acceptance is earned by preceding beats, with cost felt in the eternal return.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nonlinear pattern taught early, closure is a conceptual repricing with cost ("consumed and renewed her"). Accumulative lens holds, orientation clear and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid setting (astral orchard, crystallized moonlight bathroom) and the pistachio shell object charge the final image, constraining choices and deepening theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from search to self-knowledge through her agency (inquiry, reflection). Cost is legible in the acceptance of eternal caretaking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of nonlinear time and self-creation emerges through images and recursive logic, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Consistent lyrical POV, distinct perceptual signature, and controlled rhythm support the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dense, poetic prose with high information density; occasional figurative flourishes are voice-motivated and do not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of recursive time, astral orchard, and curator role; risk-taking in nonlinear narrative heightens stakes and coherence.</comment>
