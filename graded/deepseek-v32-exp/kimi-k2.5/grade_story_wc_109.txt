<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The oracle's obsession is concretely embodied in actions and perceptions, driving the ritual with visible cost as she becomes the map. However, the single-minded focus limits internal contradiction, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds firmly; closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing (endless night as methodology) with clear cost (booklet disintegrates, she transforms). Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and integral; the fort, pebbles, and booklet charge the final image and actively constrain the oracle's choices, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes in mapping silence escalate through her agency; cost is unmistakable in the dissolution of the booklet and her transformation, driving a meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as substance emerges through concrete images, avoiding moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, poetic, and consistent; third-person limited POV filters all through the oracle's perception with impeccable rhythmic control and no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without loops or artifacts; sentence-level propulsion and high information density support the accumulative pattern, and no figurative muddle obscures peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of mapping silence is fresh and organic; synthesis of oracle, fort, and silence feels inevitable, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
