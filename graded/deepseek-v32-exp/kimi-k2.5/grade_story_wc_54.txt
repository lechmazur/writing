<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and trait-consistent; Maya’s functional creativity drives consequential choices. Interiority is concrete and particular, though the emotional register remains stoic, missing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Final choice (translation of the terminal) is earned by prior causality with visible cost, but the internal struggle is underplayed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (conceptual repricing of the terminal) with undeniable conceptual cost legible in the final image of condensation and colonists. Orientation is immediate; the single-scene structure tightens meaningfully around the repurposing act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining and enabling every tactical choice. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Maya’s engineering perspective. The sextant piece and terminal’s circulatory systems charge the final image. Micro-setting as tool and environment meets the 9+ test decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hope vs. decay) escalates via Maya’s agency under the accumulative lens. Pressure coheres and tightens through her night-long labor of redirection. Cost is legible in the transformed function and the “stoic wonder” earned. One meaningful deepening suffices and is delivered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (hope as redirected flow, resurrection through repurposing) emerges organically from concrete action and image, never stated. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in the sextant’s shifting meaning and the maze of intentions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt; voice has a distinct perceptual signature blending technical precision and lyrical observation. Diction remains within Maya’s plausible lexicon. No head-hopping; purposeful compression and rhythmic control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, figurative, and highly purposeful, with excellent information density and sentence-level propulsion. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm varies naturally with the beat. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off at closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of engineering rigor and lyrical hope feels fresh and inevitable. The core premise—translating a spaceport into a greenhouse—is transformed through specific, grounded detail and character choice. Risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
