<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "heart hammered against her ribs"); her relationship with Thomas forces a meaningful change from archiving to rescuing, earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal plot with tight because/therefore linkages; orientation is clear within 120 words; closure is a decisive change (rescue) with felt cost (Thomas's forty-year wait) and the lens holds consistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly selective and pressures choices (mist-clad atrium as conduit); the hearing aid as micro-setting constrains tactics and charges the final image; sensory detail reflects POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protecting vulnerable voices) is signaled early; escalation is driven by Elena's agency under causal lens (tracking pulses leads to discovery); cost is visible in the risk and Thomas's suffering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events (incidental heroism, memory); subtext in objects (photograph, hearing aid); ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and consistent; voice has a distinct lyrical perceptual signature; rhythm controls heighten pressure without obscuring clarity; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and coherent; sentences advance story and atmosphere seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh (contact tracer for hearts) and transformed through specific details; emotional truth is high with risk-taking in blending supernatural and emotional rescue; synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
