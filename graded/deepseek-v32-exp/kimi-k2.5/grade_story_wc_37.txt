<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent, but interior contradiction and embodied emotion under pressure are limited; Elara's choice is plot-driven rather than deeply conflicted, though earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure lands with decisive change and conceptual cost, but cost proof is slightly weak at the exact ending beat; structure coherent and orientation clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, constraining choices (mica window as loom) and charging the final image; essential to plot and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake clear; escalation via accumulative density and community involvement; agency drives climax, but cost is more conceptual than visceral on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory, community, and bound release emerges organically from images; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV stable and voice distinct with poetic perceptual signature; no head-hopping; rhythmic control supports accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or artifacts; figurative language cohesive and purposeful, though slightly overwritten in parts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise fresh with specific synthesis; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
