<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Kaelen's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her philosophy; her final satisfaction is earned by prior causality, though internal conflict is minimal, fitting the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens held; closure is a Conceptual Repricing with legible cost in the final image ("appreciation was itself a form of repair"); orientation clear early, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting vividly filters through POV, with the parapet, net, and fireflies constraining choice and charging the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, integral to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (appreciating hidden effort) escalates through deepening density under accumulative lens; agency in attention and mending, with cost legible in the final realization, though external pressure is low.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars; subtext in image and action; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, earned through concrete experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature; lyrical voice reflects character's mind; no head-hopping; elision taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or scaffold; figurative language coherent and purposeful, supporting propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elements feels inevitable; specific details transform familiar tropes; risk-taking in quiet, contemplative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
