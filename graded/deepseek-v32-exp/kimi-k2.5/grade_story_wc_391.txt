<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation and interiority are concrete, with embodied emotion ("the wildness inside her stretch and settle") and micro-choices under pressure (leading the crossing without hurrying). The final choice is earned by years of patient preparation, with cost legible in the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (successful crossing) with felt cost ("the patient revolution that had taken seven years"). Causal lens holds: because of moon-tracking, the viaduct forms, enabling escape. Orientation is clear early; structure is a single scene with meaningful tightening at the six-minute window.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (basalt sanctuary, frozen lake) pressures choices (viaduct timing, crossing speed) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("breath crystallizing," "frozen lake groaned"). The environment constrains tactics and is indispensable to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape) is signaled early; escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens (viaduct's six-minute window forces deliberate action). Cost is unmistakable on-page (risk of scattering atoms, years of waiting). One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (patience as revolutionary tool) emerges through concrete events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("freedom was not seized but earned through restraint") without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature (horizon mapper's attention to moon paths, magnetic fields). Voice is controlled and rhythmic under pressure. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (the viaduct's mechanics) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("wolves dressed in meditation"). No artifacts obscure closure; sentence-level propulsion matches scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of magnetic viaduct, patient revolution, and horizon mapping feels inevitable in hindsight. The concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. Risk-taking (lyric intensity) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
