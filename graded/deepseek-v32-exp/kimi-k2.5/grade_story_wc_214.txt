<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elian's spiritual curiosity and internal conflict are embodied through concrete actions like using the lantern glass and dancing. His epiphany is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the "garden growing in the space where fear had been." No stock phrasing or diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a conceptual repricing where Elian's realization reweights his isolation into purposeful surrender. Cost is legible in him walking into dawn with vulnerability as an atmosphere. Orientation is anchored early, no disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The observatory and yellow lantern glass function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Elian's POV, such as "sulfur-tinted surface transforming the sky into a cathedral of amber shadows."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Elian's search for meaning, escalating through his empathetic observation of falling stars. Agency in tracing paths and dancing leads to a deepening where cost is unmistakable: his vulnerability becomes "an atmosphere through which he could burn brightly."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of surrender and creation emerges through particulars like the falling stars and lantern glass, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "to trace the path of falling stars was to map the geography of surrender."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct perceptual signature; lyrical prose reflects Elian's spiritual curiosity. Voice is consistent and controlled, with rhythmic variation that heightens pressure, such as in the description of the meteor shower.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purpose-driven, e.g., "scattering light like seeds across the dark soil of space." No clarity issues at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic janitor, yellow lantern glass, and empathetic observation transforms familiar tropes. Risk-taking in lyrical, introspective style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
