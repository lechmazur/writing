<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya’s dual allegiance is embodied in concrete micro-choices (tagging graffiti, adjusting her badge) and the final charged poise feels earned by her prior causality. Her orderly intuitive trait and interior conflict are shown through action and perception, though secondary characters remain off-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with legible cost—the community’s transformation and Maya’s poised stance. Causal lens holds tightly: privatization triggers graffiti network, which activates before the inspection arrives. Orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The raft‑city carnival is vividly specific and constrains choice at every turn—the damp walls, layered graffiti, and the foundation stone chip as a tool that scores the final map. Setting pressures tactics and charges the closing image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving culture against privatization) escalates through Maya’s agency: her graffiti network reorganizes resistance, and the arrival of inspection boats tightens pressure. Cost is legible in the “hopeful desperation” and the hidden infrastructure that will survive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of balancing evolution and memory emerges from particulars (the chip, graffiti symbols, dual allegiance) without moralizing. The final line—“they would privatize the rafts, perhaps, but not the carnival”—offers a resonant, non‑literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinctive, with a perceptually selective voice that blends poetic observation (“bruised purples”) with tactical precision. No head‑hopping; rhythmic control supports pressure, and any elision (graffiti codes) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with strong imagery and varied syntax. A slight overwritten phrase (“hopeful desperation… threatening and buoyant”) creates a minor figurative muddle, but no loops or artifacts harm closure; momentum remains high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><risk distinction and specificity elevate the premise. The synthesis of raft‑city carnival, culture‑shock absorber, and graffiti‑coded resistance feels organic and inevitable, with risk‑taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
