<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's dual profession and guilty motivation are concrete; her raw apology abandoning metaphor shows earned change. The spirit's response deepens the relationship, though some emotional beats lean slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens held; closure lands with felt cost (unwritten column, shattered bottle) and the dawn deadline persistently shapes tactics. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sheet music archive and orchard constrain choice (acoustic anchor for the ghost) and charge the final image of falling trees; sensory details like "rain and rosin" are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (apology before dawn) escalates via time pressure; Elara's agency in reconnection leads to an imperfect resolution with legible cost in the spirit's partial forgiveness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect miracles emerges through metaphors ("bell," "seeds") without statement; the ending reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV stable with a distinct poetic voice ("dust motes swam like silver fish"); perception is consistently filtered through Elara's ethereal grit.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative but controlled; no artifacts harm closure. Minor overwriting in peak beats ("cello strings scraping against regret") is voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gossip columnist and exorcist feels inevitable; premise is transformed through specific details like the perfume bottle and induced currents.</comment>
