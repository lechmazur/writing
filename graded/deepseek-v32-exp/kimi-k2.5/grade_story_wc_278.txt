<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt and motivation are concretely embodied through her actions with the letters, amber, and haunted firmware. Her final choice to tether and reach through time is earned by prior causality, and the contradictory impulses of fear and penance are present in scene. The resolution carries visible emotional cost without diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (younger self turns back) with felt cost on the page. Causal/Hybrid lens holds tightly: the cabinet’s arrival triggers a because/therefore chain leading to the tethering. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of the haunted firmware shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the laboratory equipment, amber, and glass dome all pressure Elara’s actions. The amber as micro-setting charges the final image by anchoring the tether. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolving guilt) escalates through protagonist agency: reading letters forces her to use the forbidden translation protocols. The tethering action narrows options and carries unmistakable cost—the energy to punch through causality and the emotional price of facing her past.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of guilt and forgiveness emerges organically from concrete images (lost sounds, amber, baby cries) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the baby cries translate into forgiveness, reweighting prior material through a charged final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, scientific voice that reflects Elara’s expertise. Perceptual signature is strong—she filters the world through lost sounds and constellations. No head-hopping; purposeful compression supports the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with no loops or scaffold obscuring causality. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates during the tethering beat without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of constellation tattooist, haunted firmware, and temporal folding feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric prose and time-travel mechanics heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
