<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kael's boredom and longing are concretely embodied, and his final smile is earned by the journey through the mutiny with visible cost (shattered amulet). However, contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene, preventing the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant conceptual repricing with clear cost ("the broken amulet now dust in his hands"). Orientation is immediate, and the amulet's curse persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite and solar storm are vividly specific and constrain choice; the amulet fragment as a recurring object decisively charges the final image and Kael's realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the solar storm's intensification and Kael's active navigation; the cost of the amulet's destruction is unmistakable and reweights the stake from boredom to understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the mutiny and amulet's shattering, offering a non-literal answer about farewells as translations; the final image reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, poetic, and consistent, with a controlled perceptual signature ("dimensionally aware"); POV is stable, and rhythmic variation supports pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density; no loops or artifacts obscure closure. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, accelerating toward the final realization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes immortality, spatial mutiny, and emotional inquiry with specificity; the fusion feels inevitable and heightens stakes without gimmickry, delivering a fresh, coherent vision.</comment>
