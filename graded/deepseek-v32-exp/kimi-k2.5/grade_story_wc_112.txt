<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion. However, lacks contradictory impulses in scene, preventing higher band. Final choice is earned with visible cost in validation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchored early; causal lens holds firmly. Closure lands on-page with felt cost ("icy warmth spread through his chest—validation mingling with the cold air") and persistent constraint (magnetic nexus) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory detail integrated into action; setting (station, dome, ore deposits) constrains choice and charges final image. Micro-setting elements like lever and holographic interface are essential to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early; escalation driven by protagonist agency (pulling lever) under causal lens. Cost is legible in temperature drop and validation, tightening options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from events and images; subtext in Dr. Vex's doubt and Kael's motivation. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer ("moments could slide sideways like skiffs across ice") without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (mechanic's precision). Voice is consistent and poetic; dialogue minimal but natural. No head-hopping, and rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid with varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("frost crept... like a living thing") is coherent and purposeful. Information density high, propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of xenobiology, temporal physics, and personal motivation feels inevitable. Risk-taking in conceptual premise heightens stakes without gimmickry; transformation through specific detail.</comment>
