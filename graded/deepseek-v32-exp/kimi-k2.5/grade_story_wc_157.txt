<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure, but interior contradiction is underdeveloped; his defiance is consistent rather than conflicted, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost (capture but message endures) under a causal lens; orientation is early, and the thought tax constraint shapes tactics tightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful; the gourd seed and greenhouse constrain choices and charge the final image with the moth's emergence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elias's agency; the drone attack and collapse of the warp effect create a meaningful tightening with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of defiance emerges through action and image; the ending's luna moth offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and controlled, reflecting Elias's scholarly observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, but minor overwriting ("converging chaos" repetition) and some told description slightly dull momentum without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and synthesized organically; garden encoding and thought tax create a specific, non-obvious angle with emotional truth.</comment>
