<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to escape fate is clear and intensifies; her "bleak exhilaration" embodies contradictory impulses, and the final choice to step into the beam is earned by prior causality with visible cost (terror of uncertainty).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (absolute uncertainty), causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate; hunger stone and tide act as persistent constraints that shape tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice (low tide reveals stone, lighthouse gears enable reversal); the hunger stone as micro-setting charges the final image with reweighted meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escaping fate) escalates through Elara's agency under the causal lens; cost is unmistakable in the final paragraph as she embraces "the terror of having no future."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through resonant images (yoyo, hunger stone, lighthouse) without moralizing; the ending offers a non-literal answer by repricing fate's tyranny into uncertain freedom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice remains consistent under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., "unwinding the night") is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, varied syntax, and zero loops; figurative language is coherent and propels momentum, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lighthouse, hunger stone, and yoyo feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in abstract concepts heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the vision is singular.</comment>
