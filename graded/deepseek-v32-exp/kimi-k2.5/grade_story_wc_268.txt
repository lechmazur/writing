<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The titan's steadfast dignity and the pretender's arrogance are clear but archetypal; interior contradiction is absent, limiting depth. The final choice (unmask and walk away) is earned by long causality, but without on-page internal struggle or micro-choices that reveal layered values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a decisive change (unmasking, library dissolution) with visible cost (ink pellet dissolves, columns crumble). Orientation is immediate; the star-aligned timing and rune mechanics are set up and pay off without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral—the library confines the action, the ink pellet and rune constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details (cold marble, dust, moonlight) are woven through action and reflect the titan’s ancient perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the titan’s agency under the causal lens; the confrontation tightens into the rune’s revelation, with cost legible in the library’s collapse and the pretender’s exposure. Dominant stake (unmasking) is signaled early and resolved with a visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of truth vs. deception, humility, and transience emerge through concrete images and actions, not statement. The final image (titan walking away, library dissolving) offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through the titan’s ancient, dignified perception. Lyrical, archaic voice is consistent and heightens pressure without obscuring clarity; dialogue (one line each) is character-specific and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with varied rhythm and sentence structures; no loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle. Information density is high—every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Peak beats (unmasking, collapse) are clear and propelled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic elements (diminutive titan, library, rune of drift) feels inevitable in hindsight. Distinctive voice and risk-taking in tone (graceful collapse) heighten stakes without gimmickry; the story commits fully to its premise.</comment>
