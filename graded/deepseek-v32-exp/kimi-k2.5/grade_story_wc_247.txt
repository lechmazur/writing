<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear, rooted in loss and artistic obsession, intensifying through tactile mapping. Interiority is concrete (joyful sorrow bloom, trembling hands), and his final choice—signing the symphony—is earned by prior beats of silent measurement. Mara’s signing provides relational pressure, forcing micro-choices. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphany; cost is felt in the bittersweet closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: pattern of mapping silence builds to a resonant reconfiguration where silence becomes full. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing ("But the silence will") with undeniable cost in the joyful sorrow. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks. Persistent constraints (deafness, filmless camera) shape tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Harbor and moonlight are vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through Elias's perception. The setting functions as micro-setting: the silence he maps constrains his choices and charges the final horizon image. Sensory detail (bioluminescence, fogged breath) reflects urgency and POV bias. Spatial choreography is clear and evolves with his movement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating silence to disrupt forgetting) escalates accumulatively through Elias's agency: mapping, conducting, then signing the symphony. Cost is legible in the "joyful sorrow" and the reconfigured silence. One meaningful tightening (the pivot at the mast) forecloses emptiness, reweighting options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence, memory, and art emerges organically through concrete action and image. Subtext operates in signing and the filmless camera. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer ("But the silence will") that reweights prior material without moralizing. No abstract statements; emotional honesty avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with a distinct lyrical texture and perceptual signature shaped by Elias's deafness and artistic focus. Voice modulates with emotional intensity (e.g., "joyful sorrow bloom"). No head‑hopping; elision (the whispers he cannot hear) is taught and pays off. Internal thought is consistently filtered through embodied perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("mapping silence into geometry") is consistent and purposeful, never muddying clarity. Information density is high; every sentence advances atmosphere or character. Sentence‑level propulsion varies naturally with the accumulative build, and the final image lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Concept—mapping silence with a filmless camera, signing a symphony—is a fresh, non‑obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes of the forgotten artist are transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk‑taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Authenticity of vision is singular and fully committed.</comment>
