<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete and embodied (e.g., "teeth ache," "trembling precision"). Her final choice—transforming penance into restoration—is earned by prior causality with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (restoration and personal evolution); causal lens holds tightly from past failure to present correction. Orientation is immediate, and the persistent constraint of her past shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral to choice—the Thunder-echo range, driftwood markers, and canyon hush constrain action and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtering through Mira's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens; her playing the flute and correcting the past constitute a meaningful tightening with legible cost (penance transformed into craft). Dominant stake (harvesting insights from failure) is sustained and resolved.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and imagery—failure, atonement, evolution of guardianship—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mira's realization and the restored range.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature (e.g., "avalanchingly quiet") that reflects Mira's mindset. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and no head-hopping or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense but clear, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, supporting momentum without muddying peak beats. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of relic keeper, world-weaving, and atonement feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the premise is transformed through specific detail.</comment>
