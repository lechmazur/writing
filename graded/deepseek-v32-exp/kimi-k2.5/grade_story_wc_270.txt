<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as an insurgent grandmother is clear and contradictory impulses between tradition and evolution are embodied; her final choice to release the embryo is earned by prior causality with visible cost of defying elders.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from telepathy to kite to unsealing; closure lands with decisive change as the embryo grows, cost legible in plants' surge and Mira's defiance; orientation anchored early within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Volcanic hot springs are vividly sensory and constrain choice via thermal properties; the kite and amber as micro-settings charge the final image; environment mirrors internal transformation without generic placeholder.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of evolution vs. preservation escalates through decoding script and precise unsealing; agency drives tightening options; cost is unmistakable in the reconfiguration of tradition and plant feedback.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of evolution with intent emerges from particulars like amber and kite; final image of sequoia growing offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext in plant telepathy enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature; lyrical prose reflects Mira's mindset; no head-hopping; diction consistent under pressure, with purposeful compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dense, rhythmic lines advance story and atmosphere; no loops or scaffold; figurative language coherent and voice-motivated; information density high without obscuring clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of insurgent grandmother, plant telepathy, and bio-engineering; specific details like kite script feel inevitable; risk-taking in conceptual premise heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
