<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vey's motivation (escape from pain, search for home) is clear and intensifies; interiority is embodied in mercury-glass skin and quicksilver grief. The final choice to seed the mountain is earned by the stone's discovery and the realization about buried talents, with visible cost in accepting coexistent pain. Contradictory impulses (substitution vs. facing memory) act in scene, and the renunciation of illusion is credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through imagery to a Conceptual Repricing where home is reconfigured as seeded grammar. Closure lands on-page with Vey seeding glyphs, the mountain shuddering, and cost felt as pain coexisting with growth. Orientation is anchored early (Vey at staircases, bookstore mountain), and causality is tight from substitution faltering to discovery to action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (labyrinthine bookstore drilled into mountain) and constrains choice: the maze leads to the stone, and the mountain as graveyard of tongues charges the final image. Sensory detail (mercury-glass reflections, dust and ink) is filtered through Vey's perception, and the environment shapes tactics (summit for starlight, stone for seeding).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding/creating home) escalates under Accumulative lens: substitution falters, stone discovered, comprehension leads to seeding. Agency is Vey's throughout; cost is legible in the shattering of substitution and acceptance of painful memory. One meaningful tightening (stone's revelation) forces a trade-off from illusion to active construction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (home as constructed syntax, not fixed place) emerges organically from Vey's journey and the stone's glyphs. Subtext operates through images like "hidden thunder" and mercury grief. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the seeding action and final line ("text still wet with ink of becoming"), without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature: lyrical, metallic imagery reflects Vey's mercury-glass nature. Voice modulates with pressure (e.g., "clicking a rhythm like hidden thunder") and maintains rhythmic control. No head-hopping; elision (like the feather's use) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density; figurative language ("mercury-glass skin," "quicksilver grief") is consistent and purposeful. No paraphrase loops or scaffold artifacts; sentence rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with discovery. Closure image remains clear despite complexity, with no muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Premise is fresh: mercury-glass seer in a mountain bookstore graveyard of tongues transforms tropes of memory and home. Synthesis feels inevitable (buried talents as comprehension, seeding as grammar). Risk-taking in lyrical accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; specific details (feather, stone glyphs) are irreplaceable.</comment>
