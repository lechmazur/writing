<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's interior contradiction (blank face vs. theatrical narration) and morally ambiguous past are concretely embodied; his motivation to cultivate lightness in grief drives micro-choices that earn the Charged Poise closure with visible cost in the woman's exhale.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Charged Poise with felt cost (woman exhales without measuring sound, turbines mark time beyond happiness/grief); orientation clear early; persistent constraint (remade hush) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (turbines, farmhouse) pressures choices and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's POV; the dried flowers and shadows reconfigure meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (emotional survival in remade hush) escalates via Elias's agency—his dramatic narration tightens pressure with the traveler's arrival; cost is legible in her unmeasured exhale, though accumulative escalation is subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (performance as bridge from enforced joy to authentic feeling) emerges through particulars without moralizing; ending image reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity, offering a non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV stable (third-person limited to Elias); voice has distinct perceptual signature with theatrical narration; diction and rhythm control heighten pressure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and legible, avoiding muddle in peak beats; syntax propels the accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-regime emotional recovery and theatrical ritual; specific details (turbines, whittling) transform tropes; risk-taking in lyric style coheres with closure and stakes.</comment>
