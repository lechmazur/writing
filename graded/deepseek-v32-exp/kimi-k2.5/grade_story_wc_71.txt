<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maya's motivation as a "creeping normality noticer" is clear and consistent, driving her investigation with embodied actions. However, interiority lacks contradictory impulses, limiting emotional depth; her final choice is earned but cost is external. The characterization supports the accumulative lens well.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure with conceptual repricing is achieved: Maya's realization that houses are listening reweights the premise with felt cost. The accumulative lens holds, pattern recognition escalates cleanly, and orientation is clear early. Cost is legible in the cottage's shiver and streetlights settling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail; the quiet bay and houses charge the final image of awakened consciousness. Environment constrains Maya's choices through her observation and the displaced objects, directly shaping the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulated observations under the accumulative lens; Maya's agency in placing the orris root drives a meaningful deepening. Cost is unmistakable in the houses' response and reconfigured objects, tightening the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of aliveness through accumulated quiet emerges subtly from imagery and realization, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature; poetic diction and rhythmic control enhance the accumulative texture. Voice is consistent, and purposeful elision (e.g., "hushed blaze") pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density; no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, propelling the scene with clarity. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms the haunted house trope into listening entities; specific details like orris root and displaced objects create an inevitable feel. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels organic.</comment>
