<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply integrated with the theme of brokenness; her intentional damage and choice to carry silence are earned through concrete actions and embodied emotion, with contradictory impulses shown in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under an accumulative lens, the plot builds density to a resonant reconfiguration where Mira becomes the net; cost is legible in the final image of silence settling into her mask, and the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary, net, and tapestry needle are not just vivid backdrops but constraining tools that charge the closure; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, with environment shaping choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mira's agency in unraveling knots, leading to a tangible cost as she absorbs the accumulated silence, foreclosing her previous path; pressure tightens under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of brokenness, silence, and release; the ending offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature that reflects Mira's focused attention; POV is stable and rhythmically controlled under pressure, with any elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, enhancing clarity and propulsion in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of mask restorer, ghost net, and accumulated silence feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, with a specific non-obvious angle.</comment>
