<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in embodied conflict; her reluctant metamorphosis is earned by prior causality with visible cost on the page. The final choice to become a bridge is driven by contradictory impulses—steadfast devotion versus fear of loss—shown in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with legible cost (permanent fixture in the grove), under a causal lens that holds tightly. Orientation is anchored early; the fortune cookie premise drives cause-and-effect linkages to a resonant ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The orchard setting constrains choice (place where time sleeps) and charges the final image with bioluminescent detail. Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through Elara's perception, though slightly ornate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reforging bond beyond death) escalates via Elara's agency—pouring spices, conjuring—leading to a tightening with unmistakable cost: her transformation and permanence in the orchard.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of love as violent becoming emerges through concrete images and the final reunion, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and metamorphosis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is selective and rhythmic control heightens pressure. No head-hopping; dialogue, though minimal, carries subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and legible, though risk of overwriting exists; closure clarity remains unharmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of afterlife reunion with specific, irreplaceable details (bioluminescent sap, spices from dying suns). Risk-taking in lyrical abstraction heightens stakes without obscuring coherence.</comment>
