<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's transformation from rigid skeptic to mending believer is embodied through concrete actions and micro-choices; the changeling's shrewd innocence adds depth; final choice to heal both girls is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain tight; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (cleft becomes a door) with felt cost (memory loss, lasting constellation); orientation clear; lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is integral and charged: garden and maze shape choices and final image; sensory details (iron, lilac) enhance atmosphere; environment constrains action and charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes clear and escalate through Elena's agency; cost felt in physical and emotional transformation; one meaningful tightening from mending changeling to finding real girl.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through imagery (constellations, bone setting); subtext rich; ending offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing; mistakes become connective tissue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice distinct and controlled; POV stable; perceptual signature strong; prose reflects Elena's scientific and mystical shift; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose dense and lyrical without loops; figurative language purposeful; rhythm varies; high information density; no artifacts that obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folklore and healing; unique perspective of forgiving skeptic; risk-taking in metaphorical density pays off; feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
