<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's interior contradiction—skeptical yet compelled to measure an intangible truth—is concrete and embodied in her micro-choices (adjusting the radio, counting beads). Her final realization ("the exact tonnage Elias had confessed") is earned by the causal journey, a renunciation of easy narratives with visible cost. Elias remains off-page, so relationship dynamics are not evaluated, but Mara's solo stance is fully realized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing): Mara's understanding of the "exact tonnage" reweights the moral calculus of sacrifice. The cost is legible in the image of the bead-count and the "stone dropped in still water." Inferred drive lens is Causal (confession → investigation → discovery → reconfiguration) and holds tightly. The persistent constraint of the physical evidence (valve wheel) shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned tunnel is a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("soot-blackened bricks," "crunching on ballast," "damp air"), filtered through Mara's urgency. The valve wheel as a recurring object functions as a setting-within-the-setting, its physical reality crucial to the closure. Spatial choreography is coherent and evolves with her movement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (measuring the weight of a swallowed truth) is signaled early and escalates through Mara's agency under the causal lens: each radio clue narrows her search until the valve wheel discovery forces the moral reckoning. The cost is unmistakable on the page in the "stone dropped in still water" and the final "exact tonnage." One meaningful tightening (finding the wheel) forecloses the option of abstract doubt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (the impossible calculus of sacrifice, the material weight of guilt) emerges entirely from concrete particulars—the beads, the valve wheel, the chemical sludge. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of "tonnage," repricing the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates richly in the gap between Mara's skepticism and the tangible evidence of grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature ("drowsy alertness," industrial decay rendered as "spine of some buried leviathan"). The voice modulates under pressure but maintains consistent rhythmic control and lexicon. Purposeful elision (Elias's absence) is taught and pays off in Mara's solo reckoning. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with high information density and figurative language that serves clarity and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or template cadence. A minor strain ("spiritualist summoning ectoplasm") is slightly ornate but does not muddy the peak beat. Sentence-level rhythm accelerates and breathes with the investigation, landing cleanly at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis is fresh and specific: the "factory ghost shift" concept is transformed through the grounded, tactile investigation and the radio-psychic method. The moral ambiguity feels earned and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the dense, atmospheric prose heightens stakes without becoming gimmicky. The story commits fully to its premise and follows implications without retreat.</comment>
