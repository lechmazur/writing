<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and interiority concrete, but the absence of contradictory impulses in scene reduces the depth of character under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost under an accumulative/textural lens; orientation is immediate and the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The water clock shop and objects constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are internal with escalation through reflective deepening; cost is legible but agency is passive, fitting the accumulative lens yet limiting pressure.</comment>
