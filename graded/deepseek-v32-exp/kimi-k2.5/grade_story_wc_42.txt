<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to harness the ephemeral is concrete and drives her high-stakes choice to stay; interiority is embodied (e.g., fingers stained with possibility). The final transcendence feels earned by her lifelong pursuit, with cost legible in her disappearance. Minor risk of over-articulated wisdom at closure is offset by dramatic precedent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds tightly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Elara becomes "changelessly constant") with clear conceptual cost (her physical loss, the observatory transformed). Orientation is immediate; the leaf-memory as solution is thematically coherent rather than coincidental under this lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lunar observatory is micro-setting that constrains every choice (spiral stairs, damaged chronometer, torn camera) and charges the final image ("breathing with the sky"). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's expertise (whispering stars, silver nitrate smell).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing ephemeral light to save/transcend the observatory) escalates through accumulative density—shaking foundations, spinning clock, unrecorded light—until Elara's agency (playing the leaf recording) forces a cadence shift. Cost is visible in her disappearance and the reconfigured observatory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of ephemerality vs. permanence emerges through specific, charged images (leaf, clock hand, escape velocity) without statement. The final line reweights the premise: "escape velocity was simply another form of falling." No moralizing; subtext operates in gesture and silence (dried leaf as bookmark).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable, with a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature ("air thin enough to hear stars whispering"). Voice modulates under pressure but remains coherent; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression ("the luminous ache") is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic but maintains clarity and propulsion; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and supports closure ("each crater holding light like a cup holds water"). Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating and breathing with scene needs. Minor overwriting risk does not obscure cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lunar sci-fi and lyrical meditation on time; the concept of a camera repairer using a leaf's sound to stabilize a chronometer is non-obvious and feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking with accumulative, image-driven structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
