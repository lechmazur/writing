<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with embodied patience; however, internal contradiction is minimal, and while his final acquisition is earned, the characterization lacks flawed complexity that would elevate it to the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens held tightly; closure lands with decisive change (seed acquired) and felt cost (time, cold, responsibility); orientation is immediate, structure seamless, and causality intact through decoding beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral—golden dock, snow, fog—constraining choice (the rope, fulgurite) and charging the final image; sensory detail is selective and filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preservation) escalates through Elias's patient decoding; agency drives tightening under accumulative lens, with cost legible in the cold and time invested; one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of preserving primordial knowledge emerges organically from concrete actions and images; subtext in silent exchange; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, philosophical voice; prose rhythm controls pressure; no head-hopping; elision (time passage) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and artifact-free; figurative language is consistent and purposeful; sentence-level variation supports rhythm; no loops or scaffold obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seed collecting with lost techniques; concept feels inevitable in hindsight; specific details (fulgurite, knots) transform tropes; risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
