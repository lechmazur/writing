<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and character-particular, blending grief and wonder. Her final choice to launch the expedition is earned by the city's starvation and her calculations, with visible cost in risking their refuge. Contradictory impulses (somber marvel) act in scene, and her micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is clear within 120 words. Closure is a decisive change (expedition launch) with felt cost (leaving refuge for unknown). The constraint of oxygen limits shapes tactics, and the chain link's use pays off in the final vector discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and pressures choice (starving city forces expansion). The anchor chain link functions as micro-setting, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survival) signaled early; escalation driven by Mara's agency in finding the vector. Cost is legible in the risk of departure and the city's oxygen limits. One meaningful tightening (Vega convergence) forecloses stasis and forces action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events: navigation as release, somber marvel. The chain link's transformation from anchor to key offers a resonant, non-literal answer. No moralizing; subtext operates through image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature (navigation instructor's blend of poetic and scientific observation). Rhythmic control under pressure; purposeful elision (alien arrival) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the discovery beat. Closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of benthic survival, alien-folded space, and edge geometry navigation feels inevitable. The chain link as key is a fresh inflection. Risk-taking in complex concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
