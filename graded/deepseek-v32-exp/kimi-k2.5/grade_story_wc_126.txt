<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, and her interiority is concrete through acoustically perceptive details. However, the characterization lacks on-page internal contradiction or flaws that complicate choices under pressure, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing (silence transformed to potential) with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly from setup to the resonant final image, and orientation is immediate and vivid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is exquisitely selective and woven through action, creating a fully integrated atmosphere that is the story's backbone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through the density of the ritual toward the decisive reconfiguration of the chronic hush. Mara's agency in unbinding the silence is clear, and the cost—the transformed silence—is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete images and actions, resisting statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (beauty in the unfinished, radiantly undone) that reweights all prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mara's acoustic perception. The lyrical voice is distinct and controlled, with rhythm and diction consistently supporting the accumulative, textured drive of the narrative.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and highly vivid with strong rhythmic control. Minor risk of decorative density in mid-paragraphs prevents a 9+ score, but clarity and propulsion are maintained, especially in the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic decay, sound-based magic, and a thematic focus on unfinished beauty is fresh, specific, and fully committed. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, and the lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes.</comment>
