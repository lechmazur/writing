<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot with concrete micro-choices (tracing maps, adjusting her song). Interiority is embodied (stone's vibrations "like trapped bees"), and her final endurance—remaining to tend the silence—is an Earned Stasis with visible cost. However, the characterization lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and her competence is somewhat seamless under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with clear cost: Mara must remain to "tend" the hammered repose. Causal lens holds tightly: map leads to stone, ice cracks inform pitch, song conjures silence. Orientation is immediate; all beats link via because/therefore logic. The final image of sealed ice cracks records the victory with tangible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. The echo chamber stone, ice cracks, and cave acoustics are tactile resources that dictate Mara's actions. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her expertise (ripple-marks, D-minor hum). Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment evolves with the silence's expansion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quieting the chaos) is signaled early and escalates via Mara's agency under the causal lens. Pressure tightens as she reads ice cracks and adjusts her pitch, leading to the decisive conjuring. Cost is legible: the ongoing obligation to "tend" the silence forecloses her freedom. No coincidences; all turns stem from her will and the cave's properties.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of crafted silence versus chaotic noise emerges organically through concrete particulars (maps, stone, ice cracks). The final image of "hammered repose" and sealed cracks offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the inversion of sound into silence. Avoids thematic echo, though the concept is slightly explicit in the closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mara's perceptual signature (noticing acoustic patterns, luminescence). Voice is distinct, lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that heightens pressure ("a hammered repose... like beaten copper"). No head-hopping; all elision (energy beings' nature) is purposeful and paid off in the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid with high information density, advancing story and atmosphere simultaneously. Sentences vary rhythmically, accelerating in the conjuring beat. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Figurative language ("like trapped bees," "ink in water") is consistent and sharp. The final image is cleanly rendered, with no artifacts obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of acoustic science and fantasy feels inevitable and fresh. The core concept (bloom of hush) is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. Risk-taking in lyrical, concept-driven plot heightens stakes without gimmickry. The story commits fully to its premise and follows implications without retreat.</comment>
