<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's interior contradiction between enthusiasm and doubt is embodied in micro-choices like scattering coins; her final alignment is earned by prior causality with visible cost when doubt becomes a fossil.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—the universe unfolds—and cost is legible in the preserved doubt; causal lens holds tightly with backwards prophecy driving because/therefore linkages.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ambered observatory and coins constrain choices; the setting charges the final image as spacetime dilates, with sensory details filtered through Elena's technical perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of triggering expansion escalates through Elena's agency in distilling static bursts; cost is unmistakable in the singularity threat and fossilized doubt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of reversed causality and doubt as faith's medium emerges implicitly; the ending reweights prior material with the resonant image of coins as valid currency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice blends poetic and scientific lexicon, maintaining rhythmic control under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold; figurative language like "ambered into it" is consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic stakes with reversed causality feels inevitable; risk-taking in conceptual complexity heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
