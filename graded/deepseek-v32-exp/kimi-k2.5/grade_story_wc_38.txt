<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in trait (patience, grief transformed), but interiority leans poetic abstraction; micro-choices under pressure shown through dance, yet emotional embodiment slightly diluted by lyrical density.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens held; closure is a Conceptual Repricing (vault opens to library) with cost legible in effort and transformation; orientation clear early; single-scene progression tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting (sunken lab) vividly constrains choice and charges final image; sensory detail selective and purposeful; micro-setting (dice, console) integrated into action; meets 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberate truth) escalates via dance sequences and dice rolls under accumulative lens; agency drives decryption; cost felt in emotional weight and effort; one meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (vulnerability as strength) emerges through image and action, not statement; subtext in gesture and silence; ending offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable; voice distinctively lyrical with perceptual signature; rhythm controlled under pressure; no head-hopping; elision (journal entries) taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose dense but purposeful; high information density; rhythmic variety supports atmosphere; minor figurative stacking doesn't obscure closure; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dance, code-breaking, and submerged memory; emotional specificity avoids template; risk in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure feels inevitable.</comment>
