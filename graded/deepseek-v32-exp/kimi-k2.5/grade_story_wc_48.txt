<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interior conflict is embodied through trembling hands, watchful eyes, and micro-choices like kneeling to arrange cameos; her transition from author to witness is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the final step into mist.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative mosaic structure with taught shards of cameo appearances; closure lands as Charged Poise with felt cost (release of hopes, step into mist) under a consistent textural lens; seashell fragment persists as constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (mist, wet earth) filtered through Mara's perception; the spiral seashell fragment functions as micro-setting, constraining the ceremony and charging the final image with its glow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transition from writing to witnessing) escalates through Mara's agency in collecting and solemnizing hopes; cost is legible in her release of shapes and foreclosed path, under accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of quiet witnessing emerges from concrete cameos and imagery; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through Mara's perpetual collection without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature ("lucidly watchful") controls rhythm and selection; no head-hopping, and elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense but controlled, with rhythmic variety and no loops; figurative language ("swirling hush") is pattern-taught and serves closure; information density high without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ephemeral cameos and novelist's transformation; risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
