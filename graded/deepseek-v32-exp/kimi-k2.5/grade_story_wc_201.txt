<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's proprioceptive interiority and trauma-driven micro-choices are concrete and embodied. The final endurance—walking forward with the scar—is earned by the accumulated somatic memory, with cost visible in the strap's impression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing (forgiveness as an integral) with legible cost (strap falls, scar remains). Orientation is clear within 120 words; the pattern of ultraviolet penance and trauma navigation teaches early and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is both sensory anchor and active pressure, constraining Elena's navigation and charging the final image as it fades upon her solution. Vivid, selective detail filtered through her enhanced perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (algorithm of forgiveness) escalates through density of trauma memory and proprioceptive intensity. Elena's agency—enduring, remembering, solving—drives the tightening; cost is unmistakable in the strap's release and the scar.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of trauma translated into mercy emerges through concrete images (mask strap, forest equations) and avoids moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the mathematical formula—that reweights prior suffering without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, mathematical perceptual signature shaped by Elena's enhanced senses. Rhythmic control supports pressure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle; rhythm accelerates and breathes with Elena's psychological shifts. Closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of trauma, proprioception, ultraviolet mysticism, and mathematical forgiveness feels inevitable and risk-taking. The concept is fully integrated, transforming familiar tropes through specific, grounded particulars.</comment>
