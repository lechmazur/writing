<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marian's weary stubbornness is embodied in micro-choices like resisting the summons and cradling the lens; her motivation to give "rest a permanent address" intensifies under pressure and earns the final transformation with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds from crate arrival to lens activation; orientation is clear by ~120 words; closure lands with on-page cost as the lens crumbles and she becomes librarian, a decisive change that reconfigures stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting filters through Marian's professional bias; the broken lens as micro-setting constrains her choice and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details like "liquid stone" and "phosphorescent heart" integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of permanent rest escalates through Marian's agency—from resistance to entering the library to aligning the lens; cost is legible in the lens's destruction and her assumed role, tightening options under causal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and final rest emerges through concrete images like "books inscribed with names" and the lens focusing "scattered essence"; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature reflects Marian's weary undertaker perspective; rhythmic control under pressure, no head-hopping, and purposeful elision taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied sentence rhythms and high information density; no loops or scaffold; figurative language like "library was a lighthouse" coheres and heightens closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of undertaker, lighthouse lens, and underwater library feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming tropes through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
