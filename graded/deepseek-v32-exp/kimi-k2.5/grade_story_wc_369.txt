<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consuming, embodied through her lunar healing and discovery-driven actions. However, the absence of on-page contradictory impulses or internal conflict during key beats prevents the highest band, though her final choice is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure achieves a Conceptual Repricing with legible cost in the tree's transformation and her healed hands. Causal linkages from sextant discovery to dream mapping to deconstruction are tight, and the persistent constraint of the broken instrument shapes the climax under a held hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and functionally essential: the labyrinth's petrified heartwood, stormlit tower, and moonlight environment directly constrain choices (healing, dream catching) and charge the final image with bioluminescent recognition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from curiosity to understanding to active intervention; Elara's agency drives each turn under the causal lens, and cost is unmistakable in her physical healing and the tree's drinking of sorrow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—sorrow as fertilizer, maintenance as worship—with subtext in imagery and a resonant, non-moralizing closure that reweights prior material through the final realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct; lyrical voice controls rhythm and perception under pressure, with a consistent perceptual signature and no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with purposeful figurative language, varied syntax, and high information density. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts obscure causality or closure; rhythm accelerates with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes quantified sorrow, archival trees, and broken instruments into a fresh, inevitable whole; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the synthesis feels organic and transformative.</comment>
