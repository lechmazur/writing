<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's guilt is embodied in raw hands and trembling fingers; his motivation to measure the weight of his crime drives every beat, and the final choice to bear witness is earned by the accumulative discovery of carvings. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains concrete and character-particular. The resolution—Charged Poise—forecloses his detached past with visible cost ("tempered regret settling into his bones").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; orientation is immediate. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elias arranges the carvings and decides to find the daughter, with cost legible in the final image. The pattern of sifting and discovery tightens meaningfully, and the watch hand's reprise charges the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and driftwood carvings function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (salt-bleached timber, deepening blue), filtered through Elias's urgent perception. The environment directly shapes the climax—the arrangement of carvings—and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering the weight of withheld truth) escalates through Elias's agency in sifting and finding the final carving. The tightening is a deepening realization that forces his decision to bear witness. Cost is unmistakable: "the specific gravity of his crimes" and the "tempered regret" that anchors him.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars—the watch hand, carvings, sieved hush—without moralizing. The final image (arranged figures, watch hand as punctuation) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of unlived lives. Subtext operates in silence and carved smiles; no thematic echo or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elias's perception. Voice is distinct, lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic modulation that heightens pressure. No head‑hopping; all elision is purposeful and taught early, paying off at closure with the "sieved hush."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense but precise, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("sky bruised into night") is consistent and clear. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, accelerating and breathing with the beat. No artifacts obscure causality or dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of black‑market genealogist, driftwood carvings, and sieved‑hush ritual feels inevitable. The premise is fresh and transformed through specific, grounded detail. Risk‑taking in accumulative, lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure remains legible and charged.</comment>
