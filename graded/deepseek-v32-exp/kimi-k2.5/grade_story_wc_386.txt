<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "salvage something pure from the wreckage" is clear, rooted in her profession, and intensifies under the ghost's pressure. Interiority is concrete and character-particular (e.g., her analysis of dream patterns as "windows of connection"). The final choice to write the truth is an earned endurance/renunciation foreclosing other paths. A minor deduction for the slightly label-like repetition of "weaves truth carefully," which edges toward diagnostic phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building pattern and meaning through dream fragments and ghostly interaction. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara's decision to write reconfigures the wreck's meaning, with cost legible in her commitment to "translate the silence of ghosts." Orientation is immediate, pattern taught early, and the lens holds coherently through the final, resonant image of the transformed snow globe.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is exceptionally vivid and purposeful. The "candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice" and "borrowed starlight" create a potent atmosphere that constrains choice (isolation, sanctity) and directly charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's professional perception. The melted snow globe functions as a micro-setting that evolves in meaning and is indispensable to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (exposing a pure truth vs. accepting the ocean's claim) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully under the accumulative lens. Escalation is driven by Elara's agency: her revelation about the child's survival forces the ghost's hesitation and opens the "window of connection." The cost is legible in her weighty promise to "weave your truth carefully," which forecloses simpler narratives and accepts a burdensome responsibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central image of the melted snow globe: distortion as transformation, wreckage as preservation of what is holy. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication (the ghost's flicker, the globe's "eternal embrace"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—salvaging purity requires translating silence—without moralizing. The concept of "windows of connection" is fully integrated into the thematic fabric.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by Elara's vocation ("wreck-diver ghost whisperer"). The lyrical, textured prose reflects her meticulous, reverent mindset. Diction remains within her plausible lexicon, and psychic distance is controlled. The voice's rhythmic intensity ("the candles guttered as the temperature dropped") heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and highly polished, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. Information density is high, with lines doing multiple jobs (description, character, theme). A slight deduction for minor overwriting in a few phrases (e.g., "borrowed starlight" is potent but reiterated), creating a density that, while beautiful, momentarily slows momentum. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of wreck-diving, ghost-whispering, and dream-analysis is fresh and organic. The core concept ("windows of connection") and key object (melted snow globe) are inventive and fully integrated into character and stakes. The story commits to its lyrical, accumulative design, and the final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity and emotional truth elevate it beyond a mere clever premise.</comment>
