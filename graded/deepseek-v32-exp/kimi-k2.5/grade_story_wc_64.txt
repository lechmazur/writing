<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and her motivation intensifies under pressure; the final understanding is earned by her decoding actions. Slight abstraction in "shape of intentions" is anchored in her tactile work, keeping the character coherent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing that reconfigures the cemetery's meaning with clear cost; the accumulative lens holds throughout; orientation is immediate and anchors the single-scene structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobalt silo and tapestry function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, fully integrated with the protagonist's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency in decoding the tapestry; the stakes tighten from curiosity to a reweighting of her purpose, with conceptual cost legible in the final realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tapestry's revealed design, offering a resonant, non-literal answer about sacrifice and legacy without moralizing; the final image reconfigures prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with a consistent perceptual signature; POV is stable and the prose rhythm supports the accumulative texture without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; minor repetitive phrasing ("velveteen gloom") is pattern-taught and serves the textural design, no artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of cemetery gardening, tapestry decoding, and acoustic design is fresh and specific; the concept of grief as an instrument feels organic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
