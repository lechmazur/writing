<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maya's characterization is vivid and consistent, with embodied emotions and a clear motivation to cultivate peace. However, the internal conflict between her father's legacy and her path is more implied than dramatized in scene, which slightly limits the contradictory impulses required for the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with palpable cost in the contrast between the tranquil dome and the violent outside. The accumulative/textural lens holds, and orientation is immediate. The sandbag scraps and dome cracks act as persistent constraints that shape the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is integral, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Maya's perception. The glass dome, sandbag scraps, and roses are inseparable from the story's logic and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear: preserving a fragile peace against external chaos. Escalation is subtle but coherent under the accumulative lens, driven by Maya's endurance. The cost is legible in the final image, though the pressure lacks a dramatic tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete images and actions—transformation of violence into peace, continuity through chaos. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly aligned with Maya's perceptive POV. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is strong and consistent. Rhythmic control supports pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and artifact-free. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with the scene's rhythm, and information density is high without scaffolding or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic wreckage with a quiet, philosophical focus is fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the vision feels authentically singular.</comment>
