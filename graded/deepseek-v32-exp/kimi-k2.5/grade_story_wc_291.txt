<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (face-blindness vs. forensic artistry, emotional detachment vs. required empathy) are dramatized in scene; her final emotional thaw and discovery are earned by methodical process and deliberate choice to sketch with feeling, with cost visible as "weight of the face" and mirrored isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change in knowledge (ribbon match) and resonant reconfiguration (emotional thaw), both on-page with felt cost; causal lens dominates, structured as a single continuous scene; orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The quarry is indispensable: it pressures choice (descent, wet shale), charges the final image (dawn dissolving mist), and mirrors thematic extraction/restoration; sensory details (damp, glittering shale, furrowed hush) are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes (solve case, awaken empathy) escalate through Elara's agency—the choice to sketch with emotion triggers the clue discovery; cost is legible in her shallow breath and the thawing of her emotional capacity, tightening under the hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (identity, perception, truth) emerges through concrete particulars (mask/face, ribbon, quarry) without moralizing; the ending offers a non-literal answer via the witness's face and Elara's empathy, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by face-blindness and methodical observation; prose rhythm modulates with pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., the rival's identity) serves closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without loops or scaffold; figurative language ("like memory refusing to dissipate") is consistent and purposeful; sentence-level propulsion varies with scene needs, and closure image is crystal clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of face-blind portrait artist and cold-case investigation feels inevitable; the quarry setting and method of unifying opposites are transformed through specific, grounded choices that heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
