<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elias's interior contradiction ("sincerely insincere") is embodied in micro-choices like climbing with the shard; his final renunciation to embrace ambiguity is earned by prior causality with visible cost when the cloak unravels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost felt in the cloak's release; accumulative/textural lens holds; orientation is clear early with who, where, when anchored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (lighthouse, wind chimes) constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory details like "copper tubes and sea glass" are selective and filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the accumulative lens, culminating in unhooking the cloak; cost is legible on-page as exposure to accumulated moral absolutes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of certainty vs. nuance emerges through concrete particulars (cloak, mirror, shorelines); ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice has a distinct perceptual signature (interpreting wind chimes like tea leaves); POV is stable and rhythmic control under pressure supports the accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density without loops or scaffolds; figurative language is consistent and serves the lyric mode, with no muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of conscience-for-hire premise with symbolic objects feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
