<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Eleanor’s motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; her interior contradiction (devotion to family vs. truth) is embodied in micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation—destroying wealth for integrity—is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a decisive change (publishing the correction) with felt cost on the page. The “orbits of regret” constraint shapes tactics and the final image; orientation is immediate and clarity never wavers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The echoing observatory functions as micro-setting that pressures choice (isolation, legacy) and charges the final image (empty, ticking). Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Eleanor’s professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. legacy) escalates via Eleanor’s agency under the causal lens; the discovery forces a tightening that forecloses the option of silence with a clear, on-page cost (economic loss for integrity).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars (comet trajectory, pen nib, orbits); the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—stepping outside “orbits of regret”—without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; voice has a distinct perceptual signature (lyrical, precise) and rhythmic control under pressure. No head‑hopping; elision (the journalist’s call) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense, figurative, and artifact‑free; sentence‑level propulsion varies with scene needs; no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Closure image (“free fall rather than a satellite of shame”) is sharp and unblurred.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of celestial fraud, proof‑by‑contradiction method, and moral inheritance feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in lyrical, metaphorical prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; premise is fully committed.</comment>
