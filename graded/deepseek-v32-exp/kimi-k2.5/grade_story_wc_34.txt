<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to articulate unspoken needs is clear and drives the plot; her interiority is concrete through embodied actions like "her voice rusty from disuse." The final choice to encode the message is earned by her decades of work and relationship with the ghost, showing credible endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as the ghost encodes itself into the physical world, freeing it from loneliness; cost is legible in the ghost's apology and Elara's new purpose. The accumulative lens holds throughout, with density increasing through graffiti and duet.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like "static electricity" and "fossilized petals into luminous dust"; the courtyard and obelisk constrain choices and charge the final image, integrating environment with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency in encoding the message and singing, leading to the ghost's transformation; cost is unmistakable in the ghost's apology and the emotional duet that compresses time.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of communication between mechanical and organic emerges through imagery and action, with subtext in graffiti and fossilized petals; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the ghost's release and Elara's new journey.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with consistent third-person limited POV on Elara; perceptual signature is selective, e.g., "tuned to the mechanical heartbeat," and rhythmic control supports pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density, e.g., "Between lightning and thunder, their duet compressed time itself"; no loops or scaffold, and figurative language is purposeful and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality is high with fresh synthesis of ghost in code, balladeer, and graffiti art; turns feel earned, and emotional specificity avoids templates, making the story memorable and inevitable.</comment>
