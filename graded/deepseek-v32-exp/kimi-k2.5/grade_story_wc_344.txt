<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot with a credible change, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses and emotional depth is somewhat limited, though her final realization is earned through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tight causal chain with clear orientation and a decisive closure; the breaking of the seal provides a felt cost, though it could be more pronounced. The causal lens holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive setting that actively constrains choices and charges the climax; the frozen library and hall of mirrors are integral to plot and theme, but capped due to Q2 score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clear stakes escalate through protagonist agency; the uncapping action meaningfully tightens pressure, but the cost is not fully leveraged or unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of repair as listening emerges organically from events, though stated explicitly; the final image reinforces without moralizing, but lacks subtle subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical third-person POV with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; no head-hopping, but capped due to Q2 score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Poetic, dense prose with varied rhythm and no major artifacts; some purple passages but overall controlled and purposeful, with clear propulsion in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of celestial clockwork, frozen archives, and mirrors; the concept feels inevitable and risks poetic density without obscuring clarity, but capped due to Q2 score.</comment>
