<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maya's contradictory impulses—rigid honesty versus deceptive necessity—are embodied in scene; her final choice is earned by prior calculation and waiting, with visible cost traded for her father's safety.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clear causal lens holds; orientation anchored early; closure is a charged poise with legible cost ("her carefully guarded innocence for his continued life"); the ink pot's constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Funeral home prep room and vintage ink pot are vivid, sensory, and constrain choice; the ink pot as micro-setting charges the final image and enables the breach.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (asylum trade) escalates via protagonist agency when guard passes early; cost is unmistakable in the final trade-off, tightening options under causal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of justice versus con emerges through the ink pot's liquefying property and Maya's calculations; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature—mathematical, analytical voice reflects Maya's mind; rhythmic control under pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dense, figurative prose advances story without loops or scaffold; information density high, syntax varied, and no artifact muddles peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical ink, political asylum, and moral calculus; specific details (funeral home, ink) transform tropes; risk-taking heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
