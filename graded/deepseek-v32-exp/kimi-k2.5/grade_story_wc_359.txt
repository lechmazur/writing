<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's synesthetic condition and motivation are concrete and embodied, driving her choices with clear stakes. However, internal contradiction is minimal; her determination is singular, lacking the contradictory impulses that would elevate to the highest band. The final endurance (collapse) is earned and carries a visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong causal lens: the sculptor's strike initiates Elara's performance, leading to a global Conceptual Repricing where wonder becomes a measurable force. Closure lands on the page with clear cost (her collapse, the dissolved amber sheet). The two-shard structure (Elara and the distant sculptor) is cohesive and tightens effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ice cavern is not merely vivid but essential: it constrains choice (the central spire, crystal bells) and charges the final image as a "sanctuary" preserving the moment. Sensory detail is rich, synesthetically filtered, and fully integrated with action, shaping the climax's logic and stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certify wonder before midnight) is clear and escalates through Elara's agency as she performs the Sculpted Hush. The cost is legible in her physical collapse and the amber sheet's dissolution. Pressure tightens coherently under the causal lens, though the external sculptor's role is a complicating coincidence rather than a direct antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (wonder vs. pragmatic utility) emerges powerfully from concrete action and imagery, avoiding statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of wonder encoded in the electromagnetic field. Subtext operates in the contrast between "bureaucratic ash" and "frozen light."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Elara's synesthetic perception. POV is stable third-person limited. The prose's rhythmic control and perceptual signature heighten pressure without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping; the distant sculptor is presented objectively, not via POV shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative but purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. No repetitive scaffolding or synonym loops. Some near-purple phrasing (e.g., "synesthetic tapestry") is voice-motivated and coherent. The climax maintains clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of synesthesia, music, and metaphysical stakes. The core premise is transformed through specific, lived detail and a bold conceptual risk that coheres. The integration of art and science feels inevitable in hindsight, and the lyrical execution heightens stakes without becoming gimmicky.</comment>
