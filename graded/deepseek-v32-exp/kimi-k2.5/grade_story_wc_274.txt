<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's internal conflict is concretely embodied (trembling hands, throat tightening) and her decisive shift from archivist to liberator is earned by the letter's revelation and her professional ethos. The cost of her choice is legible in the final peaceful wait for capture, scaling to the story's length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly: discovery → decision → upload → consequences. Closure is a decisive change with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise as she waits), cost felt in "she waited peacefully for them to come." Orientation is immediate, structure tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The frozen library is not just atmosphere; it constrains choice (cold steel, dormant networks) and charges the final image ("towers of frozen memory that suddenly seemed less like tombs and more like seeds"). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. oath) escalates through a single meaningful tightening: Mara's upload decision, driven by her agency under causal pressure. The cost is unmistakable in the blaring alarms and her awaiting arrest, narrowing all options irreversibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from the contrast between frozen preservation and liquid truth, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer: memories as seeds, truth as thaw. No moralizing; subtext operates through imagery (silence to expectant hum).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature ("dizzying quiet," "frozen memories slept") that modulates under pressure. No head-hopping; elision (the letter's exact contents) is purposeful and paid off in scandal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear ("seeds," "thaw"). Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with the upload and slowing at closure. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of cryogenic archivism, dormant networks, and a whistleblower plot feels fresh and inevitable. The frozen-library setting transforms a familiar trope through specific, grounded choices that heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
