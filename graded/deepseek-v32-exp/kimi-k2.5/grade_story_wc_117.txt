<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara is deeply realized with embodied emotion and consistent motivation; her cautious exuberance and Milo's response create a credible change with visible cost, though minor diagnostic phrasing ("damaged nervous system") slightly tempers the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative structure anchored early; eclipse progression tightens pressure; closure lands with decisive change (Milo's word) and resonant reconfiguration, cost felt in restrained joy and the persistent constraint of the setting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sage ridge and eclipse create a palpable atmosphere that constrains the therapy; the baby hair curl and dreaming roots charge the final image with ordinary magic, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Milo's silence) escalates under eclipse's natural pressure; Elara's agency (music, locket) drives breakthrough; cost legible in her cautious restraint and his tentative participation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ordinary magic emerges from concrete particulars (curl, eclipse, music); final image reweights beginnings and healing without moralizing; subtext in silence and connection resists tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited to Elara with lyrical, selective perception; consistent distance and rhythmic control; dialogue (single word) natural and charged, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dense, figurative language is voice-motivated and coherent; sentences vary rhythmically; no loops or scaffold; high information density without obscuring closure in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Familiar healing narrative made fresh by specific synthesis of eclipse, music therapy, and keepsake; emotional specificity and risk in lyrical prose pay off with inevitable hindsight.</comment>
