<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concretely embodied through her quartz lenses and muttered curses; her final choice to leave the ribbon and knife arises from earned contradictions between professional duty and personal acceptance, with visible cost in the silent acknowledgment of her daughter's absence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds tightly; closure is a conceptual repricing where Mara's seasonal contract reweights the premise with felt cost—the ribbon faded to rust, the forgotten tools—all anchored in a single scene with clear orientation and no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The orchard-cathedral setting constrains choice (pruning water sprouts, navigating beams) and charges the final image; sensory details like quartz-clicking and cedar smell are filtered through Mara's expertise, creating a coherent, pressure-filled environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridging generational wisdom) escalates through Mara's agency under the accumulative lens—her discovery of the bag and use of antique tools deepens pressure, leading to a cost-legible renunciation in the unwritten seasonal contract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement from particulars like deciduous vows and the ribbon's transformation; the final image of the knife in the tree offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature through quartz-eye focus; voice modulates from feisty muttering to reflective wisdom, and purposeful compression (e.g., "deciduous vows") is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold; figurative language (e.g., "green prayers") is consistent and purposeful, and sentence propulsion accelerates the realization beat without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of restoration, generational silence, and organic decay feels inevitable; specific details like quartz lenses and grafting knife heighten stakes without gimmickry, and the closure image transforms familiar tropes through grounded risk.</comment>
