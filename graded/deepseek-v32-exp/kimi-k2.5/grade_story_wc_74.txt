<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and rooted in concrete interiority; her insomnia and methodical hope are embodied without stock phrasing. However, internal contradiction is minimal, and the final endurance is earned but lacks a visible cost beyond stated sleeplessness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly; closure lands with Charged Poise as the glowing glyphs reconfigure meaning, and cost is legible in her thirty-seven-hour vigil. Orientation is early and clear, structure coherent for a single scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with sensory detail purposefully filtered through Maya's perception. The greenhouse and smog charge the final image but do not actively constrain choices, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early; escalation under accumulative lens occurs through density of visions and glyphs, driven by Maya's agency. Cost is felt in her insomnia but is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the bus driver and nurse visions; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext is rich in image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature; prose rhythm and compression are controlled, and elision is purposeful. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and polished, with varied syntax and figurative language that advances atmosphere without muddle. No loops or scaffold; information density is high, and propulsion sustains to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and synthesized through specific details; the magical brush and lost languages transform familiar tropes. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
