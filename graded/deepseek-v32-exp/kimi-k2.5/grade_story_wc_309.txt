<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's interior contradiction (obedience vs. longing) is concrete; his final renunciation is earned by prior beats with visible cost when he unstraps certifications and embraces the stone. A hairline slip in explicit epiphany ("understanding finally why he had failed") is minor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing (Elias becomes inevitable) with felt cost on-page as he unstraps and the gantry dissolves. Persistent constraint (automated system) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The Icebound Spire and keystone are micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, woven through action and perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sacred vs. efficient) tightens via Elias's agency in spotting the keystone, unstrapping, and crossing; cost is legible in forfeited certifications and dissolution into myth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (automated perfection vs. human imperfection) emerges through particulars like the keystone's hand-hewn spirals; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Elias's transformation into a guardian.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature; voice modulates with emotional intensity, and purposeful elision (e.g., "became inevitable") is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or scaffold; figurative language ("brilliant dimness") is consistent and supports closure. A minor overwriting risk in peak beats is negligible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of automated magic and contemplative artistry; the keystone and lingering luminance transform a familiar trope into an inevitable, specific statement. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes.</comment>
