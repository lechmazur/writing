<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Characterization is strong with clear motivation and embodied interiority, but lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene, preventing the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with legible cost (queen given to stone, amplified quiet carried). Orientation is clear, pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and essential; the magnetic grotto and library constrain choice and charge the final image with tangible cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (planting second thoughts) escalate through Elias's agency; cost is visible in the relinquishment of the queen and the dissolution of the displays.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through image and action; the ending offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with stable POV and a consistent perceptual signature; no head-hopping, and elision is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmically varied, and artifact-free; figurative language is controlled and serves the accumulative build without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of concepts; risk-taking in lyrical, accumulative structure pays off with a fresh, inevitable-feeling closure.</comment>
