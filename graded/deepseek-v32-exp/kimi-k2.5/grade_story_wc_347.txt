<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's reluctance and grief motivate precise actions; embodied in sighs and hunched shoulders but delicate fingers. Final endurance earned with cost of exhaustion and ongoing vigil.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain clear from blueprint to frost; closure with travelers saved and Elara exhausted; time constraint and birds shape tactics throughout. Cost legible in "sat on the cold ground, exhausted."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid labyrinth, mechanical birds, and frost create pressing atmosphere; setting constrains choices (nuts placed in cracks) and charges final image of glowing trail. Micro-setting of nuts essential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes of guiding before frost escalate via bird attacks and time; agency in assembling trail and using vibration plate; cost visible in exhaustion. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of indirect care-taking emerges from particulars like blueprint method and brother's bones; final image of "graceless, beautiful trap" reweights duty without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct lyrical voice; perception filtered through Elara's expertise and stress; no head-hopping. Voice consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Polished prose with high density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold; figurative language like "brass wings" serves atmosphere and action. Information density tight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cursed orchard, mechanical birds, and blueprint-guided rescue; specific details like nuts as markers feel organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes.</comment>
