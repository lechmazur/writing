<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in grief and profession, but diagnostic label-speak in the peak epiphany ("recognize it as counterpoint") slightly reduces authenticity and earns a minor deduction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise); accumulative/textural lens holds; orientation clear by first paragraph; persistent constraint of grief and chemistry shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful setting and object (chrysalis) that constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory detail selective and filtered through the chemist's POV, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of atonement escalates through accumulative insight; cost of grief and argument legible on the page; protagonist agency in tracing foam and redefining atonement drives the deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from river and chrysalis; subtext rich. A minor explicit thematic statement in the final third ("To atone was not to undo...") slightly reduces resonance, prompting a small deduction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable, distinct POV with a chemist's perceptual signature; voice consistently lyrical-scientific; no head-hopping; elision taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and artifact-free; figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated; no loops or scaffold that obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of chemistry, grief, and natural patterns; specific angle on transformation; risk-taking in intellectual metaphor pays off with coherence and heightened stakes.</comment>
