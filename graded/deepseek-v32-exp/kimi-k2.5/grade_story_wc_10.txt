<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her final reconciliation is earned by prior causality and visible cost of deafness and trauma. No diagnostic label-speak; micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in reconciliation. Orientation clear early; structure tight with no causality breaks. Persistent constraint of deafness shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory and tuning fork case function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective, purposeful, and integrated into action, amplifying thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (overcoming trauma) signaled early; escalation driven by Mara's agency with tuning forks, leading to crescendo under accumulative lens. Cost legible in emotional transformation and final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence, transformation, and music emerges organically through imagery and action; subtext rich. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV stable; voice distinct and poetic, with perceptual signature reflecting Mara's mindset. No head-hopping; rhythmic control supports pressure, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose dense but controlled, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language consistent and voice-motivated; rhythm varies naturally, supporting momentum without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original premise synthesizes deafness, heat-mapping, and visual music into a fresh, non-obvious angle. Risk-taking in concept heightens stakes; specificity and organic integration avoid template plots.</comment>
