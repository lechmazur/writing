<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her actions to comfort the architect through silence. Interiority is concrete, and the architect's emotional shift is earned via Mara's catalyzing role. Minor weakness: the architect's internal conflict is lightly sketched, but closure remains strong with visible cost in her relieved posture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as the architect sets down blueprints and breathes deeply, with cost legible in her dropped shoulders. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; orientation is immediate. No causality breaks; the silence pocket and Mara's actions cohere into a decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image: the drifting prism terrace, storm glass vial, and resonators shape Mara's tactics and the atmosphere. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's professional perception, fully integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Mara's goal to comfort through silence; escalation via the pressure drop and resonator adjustments tightens options under the Accumulative lens. Agency is Mara's, and cost is legible in the architect's physical release. One meaningful deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as a comforting presence emerges organically from particulars—storm glass, resonators, the architect's blueprints—without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the cleared vial and the embrace of quiet.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature; Mara's fluidly logical voice modulates with pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., train whistle echo) is taught and pays off in closure. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with varied rhythm and high information density. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated. No loops, scaffold, or artifact issues that obscure closure; sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of atmospheric tools, silence, and emotional healing feels inevitable in hindsight. The gondola operator's role and setting are specific and transformative; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
