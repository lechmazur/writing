<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ash's motivation to translate loss into presence is concretely embodied through sensory perception and persistent search; his final endurance is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the song of grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—Ash collapses distance into the leaf—under a consistent Accumulative/Textural lens; the phonograph cylinder's constraint shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Scrapyard and preserved leaf function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the finale; sensory detail is selective, filtered through Ash's POV, and integral to the emotional arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Ash's agency across three days of search, tightening the stake of translating absence into presence; cost is legible in his weak legs and the song that carries across the wasteland.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory and persistence emerges through the riddle and leaf without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material through the image of the preserved leaf.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—Ash's synesthetic translation of scent and sound into memory; poetic prose remains controlled under pressure, and elision (e.g., phonograph reading) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density; no loops or scaffold artifacts harm closure; figurative language is pattern-taught and serves the Accumulative lens, though a slight overwritten tone in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of a bloodhound reading phonograph grooves transforms familiar tropes through specific, grounded detail; risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
