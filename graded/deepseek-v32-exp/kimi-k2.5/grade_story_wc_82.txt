<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to transform grief is clear and rooted in embodied emotion; her internal conflict of descending/ascending is rendered through concrete micro-choices. The final release of cranes is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her dissolution. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains character-particular and under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mira disperses into light, with cost legible in the empty workshop and ascending cranes. Orientation is immediate, and the pattern of gem-polishing to flight pays off without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly selective and purpose-driven, from the glass basilica to the tea garden; the environment constrains choice (tools, garden table) and charges the final image of cranes rising. Sensory detail reflects POV urgency, and spatial choreography remains clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief transformation) escalates through Mira's agency in folding gems, under accumulative lens via density increase. A single meaningful tightening—the release of cranes—forecloses her corporeal path with felt cost (her dissolution). No coincidence; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of grief becoming hope emerges organically through images (cranes, light) and action, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the cranes scattering; subtext operates in gesture and implication, resisting tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; diction and syntax reflect Mira's mind state, and purposeful elision (e.g., shadow detachment) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, clarity maintained even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and the final image lands with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fantasy and emotional depth; tropes are transformed through specific details (gem-polishing as unfolding, shadow as self). Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
