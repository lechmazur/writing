<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied through sensory memory tasting; her motivation to create beauty from ruins drives the pruning action with visible cost. Contradictory impulses—compassionately holding then releasing painful memories—are dramatized in scene. Final choice to plant and serve the fruit is earned by prior causality and forecloses her old burden with felt sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: Mara's pruning directly enables the seed's growth. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the fruit's emergence reweights rebellion with cost via her neural sacrifice. Orientation is immediate; structure is a single, cohesive scene with persistent constraints (memory overload, regime oppression) shaping tactics. Cost is legible in the release of memories and the risk encoded in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the rusted greenhouse constrains the planting and charges the final image of decay transformed into living trellis. Sensory detail (acid rain, amber light, oxidised framework) is selective and filtered through Mara's POV, mirroring internal states. The environment actively shapes choice and outcome, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Mara's internal liberation and subtle rebellion—escalates through her agency: willful pruning under celestial alignment tightens pressure and forecloses her trauma-laden past. Cost is unmistakable in the synaptic shedding and the planned dangerous serving of the fruit. One meaningful deepening (the growth response) reweights options under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: neuroscience as gardening, beauty from ruin, memory versus erasure. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the fruit's starlit flesh, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in imagery (rust, pruning, eclipse) and Mara's silent rebellion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Mara's memory-tasting and chef's sensibility. Voice blends lyrical observation with scientific lexicon ("synaptic plasticity") without head-hopping. Rhythmic control varies with meditative and explosive beats, supporting pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language ("neuroscience as gardening") is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting in peak beats is balanced by clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of memory-tasting, synaptic pruning, and political rebellion feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific grounded choices (chef as neural gardener). Risk-taking in blending scientific and mystical elements heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The concept commits fully and charges the closure image.</comment>
