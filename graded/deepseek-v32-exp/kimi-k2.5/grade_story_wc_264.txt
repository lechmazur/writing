<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and embodied, driving his choice to place the clock. However, interior contradiction is subtle, with dreamlessness replaced by purpose, lacking strong conflicting impulses in scene to reach the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as midnight spreads eternally; accumulative lens holds through patterned imagery. Orientation is clear early, and the conceptual repricing reweights the premise with persistent constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the glowing dune and archive constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled through Kael's drive to cultivate sparks; escalation occurs via his agency in placing the clock, foreclosing paths with visible cost in eternal luminescence, though under accumulative lens it lacks multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from images of loss and possibility; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the image of keeper of seeds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with lyrical, metaphysical diction fitting Kael's perspective. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is strong, though elevated register may not suit all tastes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density; no loops or scaffold issues; figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off in closure without muddling clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of quantum and post-apocalyptic elements feels inevitable; risk-taking in style and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure image is fully integrated.</comment>
