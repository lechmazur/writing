<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, her practical but bold nature shown through micro-choices (discarding protocol). Interiority is concrete but leans toward abstract emotion in peak beats ("serenely electric," "trembling hands"), preventing deeper contradictory impulses from acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly. Orientation is immediate, closure lands as a Decisive Change with cost (predecessor's death, professional vindication). The "shard of hush" concept is introduced slightly late but pays off by transforming the central problem.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, constraining choice (the spire climb, tower resonance) and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, though slightly overwritten in atmospheric passages.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hearing the cosmic signal) is clear early. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency—her deliberate choice to invert the gain stages—which tightens options and yields a legible cost (risk, trembling vindication).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of "the beginning in every ending" emerges coherently from action and image, with the hush as a negative imprint offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing, though the phrase itself is stated near the climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and voice is distinctively lyrical-technical. No head-hopping. Some register elevation in peak beats ("serenely electric") feels slightly detached from the POV's practical mindset.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density, but occasional overwriting ("serenely electric," "vibrate without sound") creates minor figurative muddle. No loops or scaffolding; momentum is sustained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and specific—hush as a negative imprint, tuning to silence. The synthesis of cosmic scale and intimate professional risk feels organic and inevitable, with bold stylistic choices that heighten stakes.</comment>
