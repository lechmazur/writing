<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and contradictory; her epiphany is earned through discovery, and her final choice carries visible cost. The shift from professional duty to a deeper motivation is dramatized without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in her hesitation and commitment. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of discovery leads inevitably to the ritual.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The crystal caves are integral, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's perception, with the environment actively shaping the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict between duty and connection) escalates through protagonist agency; the tightening occurs in the hesitation before deletion, with cost legible in "weight of choice settle between her ribs."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from confessions and ritual; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of dissolving walls. Subtext is rich in etched words and light, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (the oligarch's absence) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; rhythm modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, but occasional near-purple moments risk overwriting without harming closure. No loops or scaffold; sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of doomsday bunker and beauty; the pearl-and-shell ritual is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Emotional specificity transforms tropes, and risk-taking in lyrical closure heightens stakes.</comment>
