<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is deeply rooted in loss, conveyed through concrete details and micro-choices. Her calm exterior masks a burning purpose, and her interaction with the young man reveals a hierarchy of values. The young man's grief is embodied and his transformation earned. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with the young man's realization that grief is both boundary and gateway, a Conceptual Repricing with clear cost. The accumulative lens holds, building through imagery and reflection. Orientation is clear early, and the observatory's timelessness is taught and pays off. The final image reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The observatory is vividly rendered with sensory detail and constrains choices: the dome's rotation and the projector are essential to the climax. The setting charges the final image as the stencil merges with constellations. Micro-setting (the vellum, the origami) functions as an extension of the environment. No generic placeholder.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teaching transformation of grief) escalates through the young man's arrival and the projection scene. Agency is clear as Elara actively guides him, and his understanding deepens with cost. One meaningful tightening occurs when the curtains of intention part. The resolution is earned and forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of grief and impermanence emerges organically through the "genuinely artificial" memorials and the observatory's light. Subtext operates in gesture and image, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: decay as transformation. The central question is reweighted without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Elara's perceptual signature, with lyrical but controlled prose. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying subtext. No head-hopping; distance is consistent. The voice is distinct and modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic but clear, with varied sentence structure and rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Information density is high, every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mourning jewelry, observatory, and tattoo stencils creates a fresh angle on grief. The concept of "curtains of intention" and "genuinely artificial" are transformed through specific, grounded choices. Emotional truth is specific and avoids generic templates. The story commits fully to its premise.</comment>
