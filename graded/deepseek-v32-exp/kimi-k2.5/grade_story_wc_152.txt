<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete and her method of listening to silence is character-particular; her final choice to warn the captain is earned by prior causality, and her disguise of wisdom as foolishness is a consistent trait that drives micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot is tightly causal: Mira’s detection leads to her warning, and closure lands with the captain’s understanding and her resumed work, with cost legible in the empire’s fate. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory and eternal candle are vividly rendered and charge the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, with the environment shaping Mira’s perception and actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (empire’s safety) is signaled early and escalates through Mira’s agency as she deciphers the conspiracy; the cost is unmistakable and the resolution is earned by her actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and subtext: the power of reading silence, the geometry of conspiracy, and the disguise of wisdom. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature; Mira’s voice is poetic and consistent, and the minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density; sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and there are no loops or artifacts that obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of embroidery, astronomy, and political intrigue is fresh and organic; the concept of adjacent possibilities is central and executed with specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
