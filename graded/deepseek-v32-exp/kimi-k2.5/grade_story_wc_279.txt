<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's whimsical yet serious nature is embodied through concrete actions; her final choice to disrupt the mandala is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the release of voices, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds firmly; closure via resonant reconfiguration (emergent hush, tile crumbling) lands on-page with felt cost; persistent constraint of chaotic acoustics shapes Mara's tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Whispering grotto and sand mandala constrict choices and charge the final image; sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and fully integrated with POV perception, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens through density increase (thickening mist, deepening unease) is driven by Mara's agency; cost is legible in the grotto's transformation and the tile's dissolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of chaos/order emerges organically from particulars; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though near-explicit statement on communication slightly reduces subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure; single POV stable with voice-motivated elision taught and paid off at closure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, no loops or scaffold artifacts muddying peak beats or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chalk artist fixing acoustic chaos feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and specific detail anchors emotional truth.</comment>
