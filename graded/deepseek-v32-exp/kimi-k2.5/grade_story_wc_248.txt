<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and intensifies from destruction to creation; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion like trembling fingers and tears. Her transformation is earned through discovery, and the final choice to become a bridge carries visible cost in the soot and tears, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from burning libraries to archive discovery to artistic trail. Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the promise is kept, cost legible in "tears cutting through the soot on her cheeks." Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful—limestone hollow, volcanic glass—and actively constrains choice: the archive pressures Maya's actions and charges the final image. Sensory details like "mineral regret" are filtered through her POV, meeting the 9+ test of environment shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rescuing the forgotten promise escalates through her agency: realization that fires were prayers forces her to create art. Cost is on-page in her emotional and physical effort, tightening options under the causal lens with no coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images like the vandalized portrait and tapestry, exploring destruction/preservation without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through "volcanic tenderness erupting," reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Maya, with distinct perceptual signature in lyrical phrases like "volcanic tenderness." Voice remains consistent under pressure, and compression of time is taught and legible, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with varied rhythm and high information density; figurative language like "mineral regret" coheres without muddle. No loops or scaffolds, and propulsion advances story through peak beats without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and transformative: arsonist as preserver, hidden civilization as covenant of non-interference. Synthesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style heightening stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors originality.</comment>
