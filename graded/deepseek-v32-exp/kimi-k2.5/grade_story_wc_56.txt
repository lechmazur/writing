<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara's motivation shifts credibly from seeking treasure to understanding deception; interiority is embodied in tactile intuition and "serene upheaval," with the final renunciation earned by prior causality and visible cost in heartbreak/healing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from navigation errors to sundial revelation; closure is a decisive change with cost legible in "broke her heart and healed it simultaneously"; orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (oil-slick water, rotting lilies) anchor the scene; the sundial functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding lies) escalates via Mara's agency—examining the sundial, aligning it—culminating in a legible cost; tightening under causal lens is clear and purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the sundial as key and the architecture of lies; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through self-authored legend.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; lyrical prose ("serene upheaval") maintains rhythmic control under pressure, and all elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dense, poetic prose with high information density and zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and clear, propelling momentum without obscuring causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deception and self-discovery through the sundial as key; specific details create inevitability, and risk-taking in lyrical resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
