<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and rooted in expertise; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (trembling hands, coiling fear). However, internal contradiction is mild, and flaws are not deeply explored, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages; closure is a decisive change (tricksters withdraw, town calms) with legible cost ("community remained fractured"). The 17-minute window provides a persistent constraint that shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices: the radio station's equipment and astronomical charts constrain action and charge the final image. Sensory details (sodium light, subsonic thrum) are filtered through Elena's professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elena's agency under causal lens: time pressure, risk of detection, and pushing transmitter beyond capacity. Cost is unmistakable in sparks, ozone smell, and her exhaustion, narrowing options to a climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of human resilience vs. cosmic malice emerges through particulars (subsonic interference, fractured community) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the image of lights holding dark at bay.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature: scientific yet poetic voice ("dust motes danced like galaxies"). No head-hopping; prose reflects Elena's expertise and stress without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is purposeful ("ethereal grit"), though minor density in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes cosmic horror and technical thriller with fresh specificity (subsonic frequencies against discord-feeding entities). Risk-taking in tone and concept feels organic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
