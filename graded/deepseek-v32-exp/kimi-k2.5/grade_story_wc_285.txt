<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Characterization is vivid with clear motivation and embodied emotion, but lacks internal contradiction or flaws, which limits depth. The coachman's patience and awareness are consistent, and his final choice is earned through sensory accumulation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a charged poise with the coachman boarding his craft, reconfiguring waiting into action under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the vow shapes tactics; cost is implicit but not explicitly stated, slightly limiting impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is integral, with fog-bound river crossing constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the coachman's awareness, actively pressuring decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear with crossing risk, escalation driven by ambient awareness sensing environmental changes. Agency is present in the decision to board, but cost is more felt than visible, reducing sharpness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of distillation and promise emerges organically from actions like stitching and waiting. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of crystalline permission, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
