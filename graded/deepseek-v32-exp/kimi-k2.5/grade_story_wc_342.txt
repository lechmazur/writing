<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's face-blind condition is concretely embodied in perception and action; her motivation intensifies under the time constraint, and the final renunciation (leaving the library) is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing (sky internalized) with legible cost; orientation is immediate, and the persistent constraint of time shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tree-trunk library functions as a micro-setting that pressures choice and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through Elara's unique perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve the sky) escalates via the live clock and Elara's agency; cost is felt in the loss of the library and the gained internal sky.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of art as preservation emerges through particulars (face blindness, fractal precision) without statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable; voice has a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control that mirrors Elara's consciousness; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and propelled without loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and consistent; sentence-level rhythm supports atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes face blindness, condemned library, and sky-painting with originality; specific, non-obvious choices heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
