<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira's contradictory impulses (ruthlessness and tenderness) are dramatized in the cord-cutting beat, and her final choice to read aloud is earned by prior causality with visible cost (exposure, complicity). Interiority is concrete and embodied, though the crisis actor backstory is slightly more reflective than simultaneous in-scene conflict. The transformation to "historian of small gestures" is credible and scaled to length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) and conceptual repricing: sunlight on the empty chessboard squares revalues absence with undeniable cost. The inferred hybrid lens (accumulative dominant) holds; the interregnum and penumbra are persistent constraints that shape tactics. Orientation is immediate; the single-scene structure tightens cleanly to the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The whispering gallery, nomadic penumbra, and chessboard are vivid, POV-filtered details that constrain choice and charge the final image. The chessboard’s absence of pawns is essential to the climax. Sensory selection is purposeful and mirrors Mira’s liminal state. Spatial choreography is coherent and pressures the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (truth vs. comforting lies) is signaled early and escalates through Mira’s agency: unbinding the ledger and reading aloud. The cost—exposure and complicity—is legible on the page. Under the hybrid lens, pressure tightens via a meaningful deepening of thematic weight, not mere causal turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from recurring images (missing pawns, walking patterns, penumbra) and culminates in a resonant, non-literal answer: sunlight illuminating absence makes the ordinary count. Subtext operates through gesture and implication; no moralizing. The final conceptual repricing reweights prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Mira’s perceptual signature: lyrical, half-true observations. Voice modulates with pressure but remains distinct; no head-hopping. The prose’s rhythmic control heightens the accumulative drive. Dialogue is absent except for reported reading, which fits the silent interregnum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density and varied sentence rhythm. No scaffold, loops, or figurative muddle in peak beats. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Minor risk of overwriting is contained by consistency and purpose; clarity at closure is untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of crisis actor, interregnum, whispering gallery, and missing pawns feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core concept (historian of small gestures) transforms familiar tropes through specific, grounded detail. Originality lies in emotional specificity, not surface novelty.</comment>
