<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's interiority is concrete and contradictory (rage, grief, desire for cosmic joke), with embodied emotion; her metamorphosis is earned by prior causality (confessions, arrowhead) and forecloses her human path with visible cost (sealed garden, flint heart). No stock phrasing or unmotivated leaps.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (metamorphosis into cryptid) with felt cost (garden seals, human constraints shed); causal-hybrid lens holds from setup (undercover hunt) to payoff; orientation anchored early (Elena in underground garden); persistent constraint (arrowhead) shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (underground garden) and objects (arrowhead, phone) pressure choices and charge the closure (garden seals, arrowhead fuses into chest); sensory detail is selective and vivid (bioluminescent fungi, damp air, silver blooms), filtered through Elena's researcher POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (document cryptid/transform bitterness) escalates via protagonist agency (confessions via phone) under causal-hybrid lens; one meaningful tightening (arrowhead levitates, garden responds) leads to metamorphosis with unmistakable cost (becoming cryptid, sealed away).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (harmony untamed, tragedy as comedy from wrong angle) emerges organically from events and images (arrowhead, static, laughter); ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through Elena's transformation without moralizing; subtext in frostbitten hope and cosmic joke.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV (Elena) is stable with distinct perceptual signature (scientific-lyrical blend); voice modulates under pressure (confessional urgency to transformative abandon); purposeful compression (backstory interleaved) taught and paid off; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold; figurative language ("gravity played like a kitten with yarn") is consistent and clear; sentence-level propulsion accelerates with transformation beat; no register drift or muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise (cryptid researcher becomes the cryptid) is fresh and transformed through specific details (flint arrowhead, static-laden phone); synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking (gravity-playful, harmony untamed) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
