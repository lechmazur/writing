<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's stoic sensitivity is embodied in concrete micro-choices; her motivation to preserve abandoned dreams drives every action, and the final endurance carries visible cost in her shivering and hushed blaze, earning the renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens held; closure is a charged poise with legible cost in her physical state and the enduring notes. Orientation clear early, and the submerged environment persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion is vividly sensory and actively constrains choices; micro-setting objects like the inkwell and marble patterns charge the final image, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes of preserving dreams deepen through accumulative detail; agency in placing the final note reweights absence with cost, but escalation is more textural than causal, keeping it below 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of interlaced absence emerges through image and action without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer about the endurance of human longing against decay.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV maintains a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature; voice modulates with emotional intensity, and accumulative diction supports the quiet, reflective tone without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dense, rhythmic prose advances story and atmosphere; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is precise and purposeful, with high information density and clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surveyor archaeology with lyrical meditation on loss; specific details like the toy horse and inkwell transform the premise into a singular, inevitable vision with risk-taking in quiet structure.</comment>
