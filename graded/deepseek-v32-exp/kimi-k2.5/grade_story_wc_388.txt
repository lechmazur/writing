<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot from observation to action. Interiority is concrete through embodied details like stained fingers and radiation burns, but internal contradiction is more stated than dramatized in scene. Her final choice to repair the diamond is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in settlers' fear and the need for comprehension. However, the settlers themselves are somewhat one-dimensional, limiting relational depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly: because she observes, finds letters, and intuits the stillpoint, Mara stabilizes the diamond. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—the settlers must learn science, and the stillpoint expands. Orientation is immediate, and the persistent constraint of the diamond's flaws shapes tactics. The final image of the storm line and Mara walking away reconfigures meaning without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the wasteland orchard and radioactive storms pressure choices, while the diamond and letters function as micro-settings that constrain action. Sensory details (amber dust, bioluminescent lantern) are filtered through Mara's observational POV. The environment charges the final image—the dust storms pause, and the stillpoint expands—directly shaping the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. myth, orchard survival) escalates through Mara's agency: her investigation, letter reassembly, and resonator building tighten options. Cost is on-page in the failing stillpoint and settlers' resistance. Under the causal lens, one meaningful deepening—from discovery to repair—forecloses the path of superstition with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Mara's quest: science versus comfort, comprehension versus wonder. Subtext operates in settlers' fear and Mara's insistence on truth. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the expanded stillpoint and Mara's role—replacing myth with durable comprehension, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with Mara's perceptive, scientific voice consistent throughout. Dialogue with settlers is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext of fear and resistance. Narrative distance remains controlled, and perceptual signature (e.g., noting the storm circle) reinforces character. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with no loops or scaffold. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language ("storms circled like hungry wolves") is precise and integrated. Rhythm varies naturally, and information density is high without obscuring clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes post-apocalyptic mystery with scientific realism in a fresh, non-obvious way. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the stillpoint and shredded letters. Turns feel earned in hindsight, and the story commits fully to its concept, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
