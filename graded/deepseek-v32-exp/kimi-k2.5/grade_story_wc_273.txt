<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tracker's motivation is clear and embodied through serene anger; his disappearance is earned by prior causality and search. Interiority is concrete, but internal contradiction is limited, though sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as tracker disappears into understanding; accumulative lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate; final image reweights time as mercy with persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory detail integrates setting with action; wind-carved encampment and disappearing ink constrain choices and charge the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake escalates through tracker's agency with ink and maze; cost is legible in his corporeal disappearance; pressure coheres under accumulative lens with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete images and realization; subtext in patterns and wind; final answer is resonant and non-literal, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is precise and selective; rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with varied rhythm and high information density; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of temporal dilation, consciousness, and disappearance; risk-taking in lyrical conceptual narrative; details are particular and inevitable, with bold commitment to premise.</comment>
