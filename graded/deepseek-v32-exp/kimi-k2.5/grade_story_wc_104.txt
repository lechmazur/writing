<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied, but the absence of on-page internal contradiction or contradictory impulses under pressure prevents the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tight causal chain from inciting incident to closure; the final image of the chain as a monument delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration with legible cost, and the persistent constraint (the chain) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is vividly sensory and constrains choice (the chain, piano) while charging the final image with post-wall sunlight, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate cleanly under the causal lens via the scavengers' approach; the cost of her non-violent stand is legible, though the antagonist's turn is slightly swift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice and resilience emerges organically from concrete images; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with a distinct lyrical texture; perceptual signature remains consistent under pressure, and elision is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Polished, dense prose with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold; figurative language is precise and serves momentum, especially in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic guardian tropes through specific, irreplaceable elements (carnival setting, arrow-as-key) that feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
