<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's characterization is concrete and embodied; his muteness and perception filter all action. His final choice to become the "repository" is a credible Earned Stasis, foreclosing escape with a felt cost of perpetual witness. Slight deduction for occasional label-like phrasing ("astonished recluse," "tranquilly perceptive") which minimally abstracts an otherwise deeply rendered interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing where the stained glass box and ghosts reconfigure Elias's purpose. Orientation is immediate. Cost is legible on-page in the transaction of memory ("transferring the burden... with no currency but attention"). The pattern of clues and revelation feels inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, a character that constrains every choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is exquisite and selective (peeling paint, scent of clover, light bending). The oasis's specific desolation is the crucible for the covenant's unraveling and the story's entire logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, stakes (preserving the unspoken) escalate through density of ghostly observation and the opening of the box. Elias's agency in accepting the role is the decisive tightening. The cost—the permanent burden of witness—is legible and felt, though the escalation is more deepening than narrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken covenants, memory, and witness emerges organically from the stained glass box, the ghosts' gestures, and the fire-scarred land. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the open box "collecting the weight of absences." No moralizing; complexity is earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable, deeply filtered through Elias's perceptual signature. Lyrical, measured syntax matches his contemplative nature. The voice is distinct and consistent, though the density of figurative language in mid-paragraphs creates a slight, voice-appropriate momentum drag.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is richly textured and precise, with high information density. Rhythm supports the contemplative pace. Minor deduction for a brief cluster of abstract, weighted metaphors ("heavy as honey, bitter as smoke, accumulating like sediment") that momentarily slows the transfer-of-burden beat, though coherence holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic, ghost story, and apiary lore feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of a "tangled covenant" is transformed through specific, tactile detail. Risk-taking in lyrical density pays off in a singular, authentic vision.</comment>
