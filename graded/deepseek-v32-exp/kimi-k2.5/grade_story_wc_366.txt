<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s reticence and warm observation are concrete, driving micro-choices (e.g., not sending the letter) that reveal a hierarchy of values. Her final renunciation—to protect the silence—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost, showing contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara becomes the foundation. Orientation is immediate, and cost is legible in the ghost’s final gesture holding the jar, which reweights the premise of watchfulness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., "phosphorescent mist," "salt-cold curiosity"), woven through action and perception to mirror internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of emotional safety escalates through Elara’s agency under the accumulative lens. The tightening occurs when she chooses to bottle the feeling of safety rather than break the silence; cost is legible in her renunciation and the ghost’s poignant response.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silent communion emerges through concrete particulars (cairns, sea glass) without statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—protection as becoming the foundation—that reweights prior material with meaningful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature ("the vocabulary of currents"). Poetic diction and rhythmic control are consistent and voice-motivated; purposeful elision of dialogue serves the accumulative pattern and closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and propulsive with high information density. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentence-level rhythm accelerates and breathes with scene needs. The final image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of silent correspondence, haunted setting, and accumulative structure feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in a nearly dialogue-free, intensely atmospheric narrative heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the core concept is fully committed to and transformed.</comment>
