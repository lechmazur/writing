<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's interior contradiction (duty vs. self-preservation) is embodied in knuckles whitening, trembling, and feverish work; his final choice to complete the parley is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("solemn weight of his calling settled into his bones").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a decisive change (parley bridges eras, lagoon reveals evidence) with felt cost in the final image; orientation is anchored early and the persistent retrocognitive trap shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (obsidian lagoon, quartz dunes, floating library) constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory details ("clouds that tasted of salt and static") are selective and filtered through POV, evolving with the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: his decision to descend and arrange debris narrows options and leads to the parley; cost is legible in the psychological weight and physical toll.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (archiving as confrontation) emerges through concrete images and actions; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final bridge of debris, though the line "archiving was not preservation but confrontation" leans explicit but remains earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV with a distinct perceptual signature ("searing reverie"); lyrical density is pattern-taught and controlled; voice remains consistent under pressure with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and serves closure; read-aloud ear test passes with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of retrocognitive haunting, civil-rights archaeology, and parley across time feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; specific details are indispensable.</comment>
