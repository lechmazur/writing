<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her survival trait; interiority is concrete via heartbeat counting and porcelain shard pressure. The final integration is earned by prior defragmentation actions, with cost legible in her stopped counting. Contradictory impulses (defiance vs. fear) are embodied, though slightly underplayed in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (integration of ghost, cessation of heartbeat counting) with felt cost on page. Causal lens holds tightly from ink patterns to spectrometer use. Orientation is immediate; no plot amnesia. Persistent constraint (heartbeat counting) shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting (opal observatory, snow, ink-frozen floorboards) is vivid and selectively detailed, constraining choices and charging the final image. Micro-settings (porcelain shard, ink patterns) function as tools that alter tactics. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's urgency and perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fetch wisdom from failure) is signaled early and escalates via Elara's agency in defragmenting the ghost. Cost is legible in her trust transition from counting heartbeats. One meaningful tightening (ink pattern manipulation) forecloses her isolated survival path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (identity, bureaucracy, integration) emerges organically from images (digital ghost, ink dendrites). Subtext is rich in implication; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("existing in the spaces between certainties") without moralizing. Earned wisdom through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, with distinct perceptual signature (opalescent fractures, neural ink patterns). Voice is poetic yet controlled, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; elision (radio static) is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative but coherent, with high information density and varied rhythm. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; figurative language serves voice and closure. Minor overwriting in early description does not obscure causality or dull the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise (death certificate error, digital ghost defragmentation) is fresh and synthesized with specificity. Risk-taking in lyric, tech-infused imagery heightens stakes without gimmickry. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight; transformation test passes with unique setting and object irreplaceability.</comment>
