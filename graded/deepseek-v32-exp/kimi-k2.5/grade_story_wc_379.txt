<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and demonstrated through concrete actions; her "leads through following" attribute shapes key choices. Mr. Alvarez's grief is embodied and specific. Minor deduction for stated motivation feeling slightly told, but interiority and micro-choices under pressure are strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with on-page cost in Mr. Alvarez's shaking and the community's silence. Orientation is clear early, and causality remains intact through the gathering of stories and the final revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (demolition pressure, courtyard as sanctuary) and charges the final image with the "sandstorm calm." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Maya's curator perspective. The courtyard and mailbox function as micro-settings that shape tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maya's agency under the accumulative lens, with the demolition clock tightening stakes. The cost is legible in the deferred grief and the foreman's paused intrusion. One meaningful deepening (the letter's revelation) reweights the dominant stake of memory versus progress.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of listening healing fractures emerges through particulars (locket, stories, mailbox) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in the community exhaling together. Minor deduction for Maya's motivation being explicitly stated, but the scene work carries the weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (curator's observant, lyrical voice). No head-hopping; dialogue is natural and spare. Rhythmic control under pressure, with purposeful elision (the letter's exact words are implied) that pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("sandstorm frozen in time") is consistent and purposeful. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, supporting the accumulative texture and closure beat without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar elements (locked mystery, neighborhood stories) through specific voice and setting. The curator's listening as method feels organic and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure pays off with a charged poise ending.</comment>
