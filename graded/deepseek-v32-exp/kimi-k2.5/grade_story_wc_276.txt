<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is concretely embodied through the rail spike’s transliteration of emotion, and his micro-choices (zigzagging, voicing silence) align with his clear motivation. The final capture earns its cost via prior causality, though his steadfastness limits contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; orientation is immediate. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with legible cost in the garden’s collapse and the spike’s fusion, making the before/after change undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sound wave garden and sleepwalking constellations are indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated with POV perception and pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (catching the echo) escalates through pattern-break and density increase under the Accumulative lens. Kael’s agency (plunging the spike, voicing silence) drives the climax with visible cost in the garden’s death and the sky blanking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: the cost of capturing divinity, the wildness within order. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; voice is distinct, lyrical, and rhythmically controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature. Experimental concepts (transliteration, voicing silence) are taught and paid off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and highly functional, with no loops or scaffold obscuring causality. Figurative language is coherent and pattern-taught, though density approaches overwriting in peaks without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sonic garden, sleepwalking stars, and emotional transliteration feels inevitable. Bold risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes and coherence, fully committed to its premise.</comment>
