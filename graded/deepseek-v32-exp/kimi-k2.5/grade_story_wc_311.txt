<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied; the reaper's grief drives micro-choices like unfolding the atlas, and his final renunciation is earned with visible cost—crystallizing fears transforms his function.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost ("maintaining his distant intimacy"), and orientation is anchored early at the dome's aperture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting pressures choice: the observatory's scattered light enables crystallization, and the cracked lens charges the final image, with sensory detail filtered through the reaper's grief.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (naming nameless fears) escalates via the reaper's agency in positioning the atlas; cost is legible as the page crumbles and he accepts a new role.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through imagery (sea monsters as fears) without moralizing; the ending offers a non-literal answer—the scythe as pen—that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinctively lyrical and stable in single POV; perceptual signature filters through cosmic grief, and rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with no loops or artifacts; figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off in the crystallization beat, maintaining propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic and emotional elements; risk-taking in lyrical abstraction heightens stakes, and the reaper's transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
