<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Castian's interiority is concrete and rooted in embodied detail (the worry stone's dent). His transformation from failure to understanding is earned by on-page micro-choices under time pressure, culminating in a decisive, cost-weighted closure. However, the portrayal remains slightly single-note, leaning heavily on the strategist archetype without deeper contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (the game begins anew, silence becomes invitation) with clear cost (the stone splits, growth revealed). Causal lens holds: his moves directly restore the covenant. Orientation is immediate; the lunar clock tightens cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus is not just backdrop—it constrains choice (pieces move along curved trajectories) and charges the final image (violet light, stabilized field). Sensory detail is selective, filtered through Castian's perception, and integral to the plot's mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore covenant/discover beauty) is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency under time pressure. The cost is legible in the stone's splitting and the reconfiguration of silence. One meaningful tightening (lunar phase) drives the climax, though the external clock could be more viscerally pressing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (beauty in difficulty, silence as density) emerges organically from concrete actions and images, culminating in a non-literal, resonant answer—the game begins again differently. No moralizing; subtext operates through the worry stone and magnetic field.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinctive, with a perceptive signature (strategist's pattern-noticing) and rhythmic control. Poetic density is consistent and voice-motivated; no head-hopping. The prose's texture reflects Castian's precise, contemplative mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Figurative language ("silence gathered like dew") is purposeful and integrated; rhythm supports emotional beats and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of chess, magnetic physics, and mystical covenant feels fresh and inevitable. The worry stone's transformation and the non-standard chess moves are specific, irreplaceable risks that heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. No template reliance.</comment>
