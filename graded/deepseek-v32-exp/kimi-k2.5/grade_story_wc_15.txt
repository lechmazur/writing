<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in traits, but internal contradiction with elders' laws is told rather than dramatized in scene; final choice earned with visible cost (bleeding fingers), yet lacks on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with felt cost (canyon shudders with relief, fingers bleed); accumulative lens holds perfectly; sleepwalking paths and plate shape tactics persistently; orientation anchor immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting vividly constrains choice (sleepwalking paths guide navigation) and charges final image (red chamber, dry well); sensory detail selective and POV-filtered; micro-setting (plate, needle) integral to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (healing canyon) escalates via protagonist's sewing under accumulative lens; cost legible in blood and plate transformation; agency drives tightening to final stitch with tangible relief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of broken precedents and renewal emerges organically through action and image; subtext in thread and dream motifs; ending offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct poetic perceptual signature; voice modulates with lyrical control; no head-hopping; elision (multiple nights) taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose dense yet clear, with varied rhythm and zero scaffold loops; figurative language consistent and voice-motivated; high information density without obscuring causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weaving, sleepwalking, and geological healing feels organic; risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes; specificity in details (sea foam fibers, filigree patterns) avoids template plots.</comment>
