<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's characterization is deeply textured, with embodied contradictions (firefighter/arsonist's daughter) driving a credible, cost-heavy choice. The final grafting act and return of sensation are earned by prior causality. Slight over-articulation in self-compassion lines does not undercut the core.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a charged poise: the graft takes, scars sing, past drowned. Accumulative lens holds, cost legible in the final image. Orientation is immediate and clear, and the single-scene structure tightens to a resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is both tactile and symbolic, constraining the graft procedure and charging the final transformation. Sensory selection (black sand, mineral current, kelp) is filtered through Maya's expertise and history, becoming inseparable from the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (regaining sensation/healing) are signaled early and tighten through the irreversible graft act. Under the accumulative lens, density of imagery and reflection deepens the cost. The on-page prickling return of feeling is a decisive intensification driven by Maya's agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of scars singing emerges organically from concrete images (kelp graft, black sand, coin) and avoids moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: fire reveals what remains, worth saving. Subtext of fire/water, destruction/renewal is sustained.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic yet precise perceptual signature rooted in Maya's history. Voice modulates gracefully under pressure, and the lyrical density is pattern-taught and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical but controlled, with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor overwriting in a few lines (e.g., "clouding the obsidian lagoon with memory and microscopic glass") is pattern-consistent and does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of arsonist's daughter firefighter, kelp grafting, and volcanic lagoon is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking with poetic density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the core premise is transformed through specific, lived detail.</comment>
