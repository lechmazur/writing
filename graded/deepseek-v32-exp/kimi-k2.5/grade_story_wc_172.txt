<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's contradictory impulses—destructive philanthropy and secret sentimentality—are embodied in scene; his final choice to bury the egg is earned by prior causality with visible cost in his "hollow peace." No diagnostic label-speak; interiority is concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost ("loved dead things enough to kill for them"); the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, reinforced by the persistent constraint of the manufactured drought. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Salt flat and cracked earth constrain choice (digging, burial) and charge the final image with rain darkening the salt; sensory details are vivid, selective, and filtered through Elias's POV, integrating fully with action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Elias's agency (diverting river, digging, releasing egg), tightening pressure via approaching thunder; cost is legible in the transaction complete and his hollow peace at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the egg as "silent witness" and Elias's contradiction as "a man who loved dead things enough to kill for them."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (lyrical, grief-tinted); voice modulates with emotional intensity, and rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and artifact-free, with varied rhythm and purposeful figurative language ("broken mirror," "fractured grace"); information density is high, and no loops or scaffold dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of amoral philanthropy and extinct-bird ritual feels inevitable; risk-taking in poetic prose and complex moral calculus heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
