<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with grief and practical ritual acting simultaneously. Her micro-choices under pressure, like carving with "hauntingly practical precision," reveal a hierarchy of values. The final endurance—shaping absence into usable form—is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the "rust-hued peace." No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied through action and perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing through patterned imagery. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mara gains understanding; cost is legible in "harvesting lessons from loss meant not forgetting, but shaping memory into handle." Orientation is clear early; the ash wood and rain-beaten skylight persist as constraints that shape tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through Mara's POV, with sensory detail like "rain-beaded skylight" and "smell of sawdust." The ash wood blank and skylight constrain choice and charge the final image, magnifying grain into "rivers and canyons." Environmental details mirror internal states without overt symbolism, and spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is driven by Mara's agency in carving and reflection, reweighting the dominant stake of grief versus purpose. Cost is legible in the trade-off between absence and practical use. One meaningful deepening occurs as the "here and gone" mantra crystallizes into a transformed understanding, foreclosing raw sorrow with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: grief becomes "furniture for the soul" through the handle-carving ritual. Subtext operates in image and implication, like "crystallized time" refracting memory. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the final image of ash wood "teachable and taught."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, reflective, and precise. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, e.g., "crystallizing time into suspended prisms." Rhythmic control under pressure is evident; no head-hopping or register drift. All elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "crystallized time" is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, from the kettle's murmur to the carving's steady progress. No artifacts obscure causality or dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of widow's grief, lion-tamer lore, and woodworking ritual feels inevitable and organic. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded details like ash wood from the training tent. Risk-taking with lyrical density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final image of "practical, haunting beauty" is singular and memorable.</comment>
