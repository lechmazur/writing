<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and embodied through ritualistic action, but interior contradiction and emotional struggle are minimal; the coachman's patience and competence are steady without genuine flaws or cost-driven micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; orientation is immediate; closure lands as a Charged Poise with the garden's "slow, inevitable siege" reconfiguring meaning, and cost is legible in the transformation of tragedy into topsoil.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice—the narrow vastness of the jetty charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, woven through action to mirror internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (reclaim battlefield before tide); under Accumulative lens, escalation builds through density of ritual and avian instruction, with agency in the coachman's fertilization and cost felt in the silent reclamation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation emerges through concrete particulars—seed pods, bird calls, submerged concord—without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the garden's siege, reweighting prior imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a scholarly, poetic perceptual signature; diction and rhythm are controlled under pressure, and elision (e.g., dead languages) is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with varied rhythm and high information density; no loops or scaffolds, and figurative language coheres without muddle, though occasional proximity to purple is balanced by closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic reclamation, dead languages, and avian liturgy feels inevitable; risk-taking in poetic density heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors universals.</comment>
