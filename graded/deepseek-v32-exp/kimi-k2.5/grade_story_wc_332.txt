<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied, driving the plot consistently. However, lack of internal contradiction limits depth, though her final choice is earned by prior causality and visible tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tight with orientation clear within opening lines; closure lands decisively with the dream vitalized, and the constraint of sunrise photography shapes tactics, with cost legible in the transformation of the dream and the archipelago's silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice, with the archipelago's whispers directly informing her action and charging the final image of silence, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
