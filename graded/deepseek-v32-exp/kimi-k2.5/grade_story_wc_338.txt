<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with methodical curiosity driving her investigation. The final choice to leave the map torn is a micro‑choice that reveals her values and is earned by her prior actions. However, the story lacks contradictory impulses in scene, and the internal conflict is minimal, which prevents a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the torn map becomes a symbol of the unknown's value, with cost legible in the acceptance of incompleteness. The Accumulative lens holds across shards (studio, vault, henge, chapel), transitions are smooth, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the map tear, henge, and whispered chapel constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details (limestone smell, water echoes) are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (uncovering the secret) escalate through Elara's research and discovery under the Accumulative lens. Her agency—reopening the chamber, then choosing to document without disturbance—forecloses complete knowledge with a visible cost (the map remains torn).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (value of silence and the unspoken) emerges organically from concrete particulars (map, chapel, torn edge). The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer through the image of the deliberately torn map, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature that reflects Elara's methodical, observant nature. The prose rhythm is controlled and matches the contemplative tone; no head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and artifact‑free. Sentences vary naturally, carrying multiple jobs (advancing plot, atmosphere, character). No loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle; closure image is crisp and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar elements (hidden site, map mystery) through a unique protagonist and focus on silence. The conceptual repricing feels inevitable in hindsight, and specific details (silent film comparison, whispered chapel) create memorable originality.</comment>
