<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation clear and intensifies; internal contradiction shown through detached seeking vs. embodied realization; final change earned by prior causality with visible cost in loosened grip on ending.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in "gripping reality loosely"; orientation anchored early; parasol tip as persistent constraint charges final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices; micro-setting (parasol tip) constrains action and charges closure; sensory detail selective and purposeful, mirroring internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learning sound of endings) escalates through protagonist's trawling agency; turning point at child's shoe delivers cost via realized release; pressure coheres under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of release vs. death emerges organically from particulars; subtext in images like parasol tip lineage; final non-literal answer reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV; distinct lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("windborne solace"); rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; figurative language purposeful and clear; no loops, scaffold, or artifact muddle; peak beats like the exhalation sound are crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of euthanasia tourism and disaster relief; specific details (parasol tip, ice marina) transform tropes; risk-taking in lyric introspection heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
