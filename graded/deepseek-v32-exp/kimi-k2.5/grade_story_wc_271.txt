<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elias's embodied trauma and earned shift from endurance to cultivation are flawlessly executed, with somatic details driving micro-choices under pressure; final renunciation of despair is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds tightly; closure lands with charged poise as Elias observes his freeze and smiles at the photo, cost legible in somatic markers; persistent constraint of trauma shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges final image; the photograph and arboretum are tactile forces that shape Elias's tactics and resolution, meeting the 9+ gate with environment actively altering options.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stake deepens through Elias's agency in observing his freeze; cost of grief is viscerally felt, escalating to a conscious acceptance that forecloses despair under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of growth as resistance emerges organically; slight directness in "optimism untethered from reality" is a hairline slip, but the final image reweights without moralizing, offering a resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature filtered through Elias's expertise and trauma; rhythmic control under pressure, and any elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without loops or scaffold; figurative language consistently serves character and closure; high information density with clear propulsion in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Synthesis of drone strike trauma, arboretum tending, and automated lighthouse is fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in quiet internal focus pays off with specificity that heightens stakes.</comment>
