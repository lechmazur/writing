<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is concretely embodied in micro-choices like touching the surgical dressing and descending the tunnel; his final shift from seeking closure to witnessing is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the acceptance of "jagged edges."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—the realization that "some miracles were not meant to resolve"—under a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation is clear early, and persistent constraints (hourglass, plants) shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (tower, cavern) and micro-objects (frosted hourglass, coffee rings) constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from passive seeking to active witnessing; cost is legible in the final image where he accepts displaced truths, foreclosing closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from scars, displacement, and witnessing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of scars as "alphabets" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and controlled, with rhythmic prose that heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or figurative muddle, even in peak beats like the cavern revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathic plants, displaced miracle, and scar-reading feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
