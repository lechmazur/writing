<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in trait, but interiority lacks deep contradiction or embodied emotion. Elara's actions align with her goal, yet internal conflict is minimal, reducing character complexity under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly; closure is a decisive change with cost legible in the time-bound inversion. Orientation is immediate, and the gravity inversion constraint shapes tactics throughout, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory detail selective to POV; grotto and inversion actively constrain choices and charge the final image with the seeds' bioluminescence directly enabling revelation, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of retrieving combinations escalates under time pressure of the inversion; agency is demonstrated through tool use, and cost is felt in the precarious navigation, though not maximally visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical vigilance and refracted truth emerges through imagery without statement; ending with the seed for next cycle offers resonant, non-literal closure, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct prism-minded perceptual signature; prose rhythm modulates with action, and no head-hopping or distance issues, though dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful figurative language; sentences advance multiple layers without loops or scaffold, and clarity is maintained under pressure, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravity inversion, archival quest, and bioluminescent seeds feels inevitable; risk-taking in concept is fully integrated with character and plot, elevating originality.</comment>
