<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelin's motivation is clear and her transformation is earned, but interiority sometimes leans abstract, missing contradictory impulses in scene; emotions are embodied in key moments like the heavy dust speck.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative structure with clear orientation; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost of permanent exile, though causal linkages are subtle and poetic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Twilight garden is vividly rendered and actively constrains choice (fountain provides dust and reflection), charging the final image with atmospheric weight; sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes of preserving memory escalate through the heavy dust speck, leading to her irreversible writing act; cost of becoming non-human is legible on the page under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Memory, exile, and art as preservation emerge organically from concrete actions; final image of a living archive offers resonant, non-literal resolution without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical, consistent close-third POV with a distinct poetic rhythm; no head-hopping, though density occasionally nears opacity; voice remains controlled under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dense, image-rich sentences with varied rhythm; minor risk of overwriting but controlled and purposeful, no loops or scaffolding; line-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tide dancer, nostalgia ban, and constellation writing; transformation feels inevitable and singular, with bold risk-taking in style and concept.</comment>
