<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The patchwork navigator is vividly characterized with embodied emotion and contradictory impulses. Her final endurance (Earned Stasis) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in the acceptance of ruin.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost felt in the final image. Orientation is clear early, and the moon-phase constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and constrains choice; the censer foot as recurring object charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigating loss) escalates through protagonist's agency in building the apparatus; cost is legible in her acceptance of the ruin as home, tightening under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of loss as a constructed geography emerges organically from images and events; final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects the navigator's patchwork nature; no head-hopping, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density; no loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally and supports pressure without figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief and climate change through reverse migration; risk-taking in accumulative structure pays off with inevitability, heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
