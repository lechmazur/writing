<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara's guarded heart and the scrimshaw's unlocking are embodied in concrete sensation; her final choice to detach is earned by the call's escalating pressure, with visible cost in leaving the dock. Mako’s mirroring deepens the stakes without overshadowing her agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from the whale’s call through her decision; closure is a decisive change (stepping into the sea) with felt cost—the false self surrendered. The scrimshaw’s persistent constraint shapes the entire arc and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe is a liminal environment that actively pressures Elara’s choice; the whalebone scrimshaw functions as a micro-setting, charging the final transformation. Sensory details are selective and filtered through her urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safety vs. true nature) escalates through the whale’s call and the island’s rise; agency rests entirely on Elara’s choice to detach, with cost legible in her surrender of the dock and armored self.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of embracing vulnerability emerges through image and action, not statement; the final reconfiguration (sovereign in the tide) answers the central question without moralizing. A slight thematic echo in Mako’s dialogue is minor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Third-person POV remains stable and deeply filtered through Elara’s perceptual signature; lyrical diction and rhythmic control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping; voice is distinct and cohesive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle; sentence-level rhythm accelerates toward closure without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-violence world, disappearing island, and whale-call mysticism feels inevitable; specific, grounded details transform tropes. Risk-taking in lyrical density heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
