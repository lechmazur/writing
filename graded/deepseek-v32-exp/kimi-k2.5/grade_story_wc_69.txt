<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and his expectant resignation is embodied; the students' micro-choices (omitting sharp notes, joining in spaces) reveal contradictory impulses under pressure. However, the three students remain archetypal, limiting full individualization, and the miner's daughter's internal conflict is summarized rather than fully dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure is a resonant conceptual repricing (rosette as map of absences) with felt cost in the "vanishing arts" and the difficulty of unlearning. Orientation is immediate, and the single-scene structure builds density toward the final image without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The velvet library and autumn light create a vivid, pressurized atmosphere; the zither's rosette functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice and decisively charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Elias's reverent POV, integrating seamlessly with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (achieving harmony through subtraction) escalates via the students' agency under the accumulative lens—their deliberate omissions create a meaningful tightening. Cost is legible in their trembling hands and "expectantly resigned" stance, though the external political conflict remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of harmony through subtraction emerges organically from the rosette's geometry and the students' precise restraint; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the image of the rosette as "a map of absences." Avoids moralizing, though one explicit statement of theme ("true harmony came...by subtracting noise") leans toward telling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and consistently filtered through Elias's lyrical, solemn perception; voice has a distinct rhythmic texture ("traveled stillness," "expectantly resigned reverence") and controls compression without head-hopping. No dialogue, but internal focalization is clean.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, varied sentence rhythm, and no scaffold or loops. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent, though phrases like "expectantly resigned reverence" border on overwriting without harming clarity or closure momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of musical pedagogy and post-conflict reconciliation; the concept of "subtracting noise" is transformed through specific, grounded details (rosette as geometric map, students' backgrounds). Risk-taking in quiet, contemplative plot heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
