<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lys's motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority is more metaphorical than concrete, lacking contradictory impulses in scene. Her chastity as resistance is a strong trait, and her final action is earned. However, the emotional embodiment is somewhat abstract, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate, causal chain clear from tutor's death to her window. Closure is a charged poise with cost (infinite selves, snow erasing footprints) under a hybrid lens that holds. The persistent time constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory detail; the courtyard and prism sanctuary pressure choices and charge the final image. The frozen time threads act as a micro-setting that constrains action, elevating the score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harvest echoes before time runs out) escalates through time pressure and the difficulty of untangling threads. Agency drives escalation, and cost is legible in the final image's sacred terror.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resistance and memory emerges through concrete images and actions. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (carrying echoes forward to a thaw) without moralizing, and subtext is rich.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV with a distinct, poetic perceptual signature. Voice is consistent and rhythmically controlled, with purposeful elision and no head-hopping. The elevated diction matches the character's worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative but pattern-taught and clear in peak beats. No loops or scaffold; high information density with propulsion. The unlocking sequence is crisp and vivid.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of concepts (chaste courtesan, harvesting echoes, frozen time threads) feels inevitable. Risk-taking in poetic density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure image is uniquely charged.</comment>
