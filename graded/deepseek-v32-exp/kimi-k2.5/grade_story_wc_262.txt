<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her traits, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. However, the absence of contradictory impulses in scene prevents the highest band; her final choice is earned but lacks internal conflict. The cost is felt but not deeply conflicted. Strong execution, but not 9+ due to missing quick test element.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate, and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds tightly, building density toward a Conceptual Repricing closure. The realization that unused love is stored in the beam of light lands with undeniable cost on the page. Persistent constraints of her ability and setting shape tactics, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and selective, filtered through Elara's POV. The projection booth and film strip constrain choice and directly charge the final image of the luminous corridor. Environment is indispensable to the closure effect, meeting the 9+ quick test with precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding where unused love is stored) is signaled early and escalates through Elara's agency via psychometry deepening. The cost is legible in her heavy carrying of knowledge and the building's hum. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, a single decisive intensification reweights the stake with felt pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete images and actions, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the beam of light as storage for unused love, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates through gesture and implication, earning the conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, mapping emotions as architecture. Voice is lyrical and consistent, with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; purposeful elision is taught and paid off in closure, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is voice-motivated and clear, even in peak beats. No artifacts obscure causality or closure; the final image is sharp and propelled by concise syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes psychometry, vintage cinema, and emotional storage into a fresh, inevitable whole. Risk-taking in conceptual depth heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details like the beam of light as medium transform familiar tropes through grounded, character-driven choices.</comment>
