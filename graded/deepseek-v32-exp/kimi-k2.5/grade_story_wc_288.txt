<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and embodied; her internal conflict and transformation are earned through concrete sensory details and micro-choices, with a visible cost in the shedding of her old self.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing) with felt cost as the old self snaps away; orientation is immediate and anchors are clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral, constraining choice and charging the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven through action and perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes are internal and escalate through the ritual; protagonist agency drives the intensification, and cost is legible in the final image and the snapping away of the old self.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of transforming isolation into independence emerges through images and events; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, earned through the ritual.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive and lyrical, with consistent POV and perceptual signature; rhythmic control supports the accumulative pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable; the premise is fresh and executed with specificity, risk-taking in the lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
