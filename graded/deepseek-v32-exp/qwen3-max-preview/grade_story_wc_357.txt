<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and rooted in past trauma, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final realization and action are earned by prior causality, showing a credible endurance with visible cost. The line "She hadn’t come to fix. She’d come to listen." crystallizes her arc without diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as the arrow tip fuses, reweighting resilience through memory with felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds, reinforced by patterned echoes and gravity inversion. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the cost is legible in the tree's shudder and lingering song.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with floating rock arches and inverted gravity constraining Elira's choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "mist pooled like liquid memory" are selective and purposeful, woven into action. The environment directly shapes tactics through dew-trail navigation and the inversion timeframe.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the accumulative lens through Elira's agency, from discovery to activating the arrow tip, with cost legible in the pulse that reconfigures the orchard. The dominant stake of finding resilience deepens into a trade-off between intervention and listening, foreclosing other paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of resilience as remembered emerges organically from events and images, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the arrow's fusion and the song, reweighting prior material without statement. Subtext operates in silence and echo motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and stable, with poetic rhythm and perceptual signature like "ghost-trails of dew." POV remains consistent, and elision (e.g., scanner failure) is taught and pays off. No head-hopping; diction aligns with Elira's professional and intuitive perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language like "petals swirling in slow, silent cyclones" serving pressure. Minor hairline slips include slight register elevation in peak beats, but no loops or artifacts obscure closure. Propulsion remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of inverted gravity, bio-resonance, and memory-based resilience, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry. The premise is transformed through specific details like the arrow as a seed, not a weapon.</comment>
