<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is deeply rooted in preservation, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The protagonist's internal conflict from past mistake earns her final endurance, and muscle memory actions reveal hierarchy of values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the burden. Orientation is clear early, and causality links her actions to villagers' trust without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is integral, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like bioluminescent vines and sky-whales are purposeful and filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency—her response to the low frequency—tightening stakes and leading to trust. Cost is legible in her burden and the villagers' stilled reaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of burden and revision emerges through concrete events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via her continued walk, reweighting silence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic yet precise, and elision (e.g., silence as signal) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with clear propulsion in peak beats like the buckle chime.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes surreal setting and non-verbal communication with specificity, transforming tropes through character-driven choices. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
