<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in rebellion; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "heart thudding like a timpani roll"). Micro-choices under pressure, such as transcribing and weeping, reveal a hierarchy of values. Final choice to broadcast is earned by prior causality with visible cost (tears as catalyst).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise as she transmits her own broadcast, reconfiguring options with felt cost (tears blurring ink). Inferred Accumulative lens holds, with pattern of density increase in dust and broadcasts. Orientation is clear early; persistent constraint (radio) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting (ember alcove, radio) constrains choices and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "mist curling at the threshold"). Micro-setting (radio dial) evolves to shape agency and closure with tangible pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, from radio pulses to tear-induced activation. Cost is legible in blurred ink and emotional weight. Dominant stake (story revival) tightens through her choices, foreclosing passive endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and revival emerges through particulars like dust and broadcasts, not statement. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via transmission image, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with poetic perceptual signature (e.g., "ink-stained fingers traced staves"). Rhythmic control under pressure; elision (e.g., pirate signals) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; voice modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "dust remembering"). Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise offers fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic revival through music and radio; risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes. Specific details (e.g., moth-wing cloth) feel inevitable in hindsight. Transformation of tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
