<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The recluse's motivation is clear and rooted in her covenant, with interiority shown through embodied actions like "bare feet brushing dust" and micro-choices under pressure. Her tranquilly perceptive nature constrains decisions, and the earned stasis at closure has visible cost in her bowed head, though minor lack of internal contradiction prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as the ghost's gaze meets hers, reweighting silence with gratitude under the accumulative lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent covenant constraint shapes tactics throughout, with cost legible in the final image of "honey-gold glyphs."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting—abandoned beekeeping oasis in a wasteland—pressures choices through storms and spatial constraints, while the stained glass box as micro-setting charges the final image. Sensory details like "scorched dunes" and "fractured light" are selective and purposeful, filtered through the recluse's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes of preserving silence are signaled early and escalate under the accumulative lens through ghostly echoes and the storm scene, where her agency in shielding the box narrows options with visible cost. The deepening reweights the dominant stake, though the escalation is more textural than causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence and memory emerges organically from images like the stained glass box and ghostly gestures, with subtext in "unspoken words" and the final non-literal answer. No moralizing; resonance arises from particulars, such as the master beekeeper's apology without speech.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct lyrical voice, reflected in syntax like "tranquilly perceptive" and perceptual signature in reading "contextual clues." No head-hopping; elision (e.g., ghostly silence) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "ghosts shimmering like heat mirages" is purposeful and coherent. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, though minor density in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes beekeeping, ghosts, and covenant in a fresh, non-obvious way with specific details like the honey press and child's drawing. Risk-taking in quiet narrative heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable, transforming tropes through lived detail.</comment>
