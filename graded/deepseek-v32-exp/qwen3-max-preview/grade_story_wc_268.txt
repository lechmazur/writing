<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deep and consistent, with the titan's motivation clear and her micro-choices under pressure revealing her values. The final renunciation of rule is earned by her exile and methods, with visible cost in the "hollow echo of justice." Minor stoicism in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with tight because/therefore linkages, leading to a decisive closure where the pretender is exposed. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible in "gasps became shouts; shouts became silence." The persistent constraint of exile shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like "dust motes danced in starlight," and the library actively constrains choices by enabling the message-based rebellion. The iron gall ink pellet as a micro-setting object charges the final image of revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes are dominantly centered on unmasking the pretender, escalating through the titan's agency in leaving messages and using the ink pellet. Cost is unmistakable in the people's realization and the titan's hollow justice, under a causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, with subtext in images like "truth is a mirror" and the final line "the crown is not worn. It is carried" offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Complexity is maintained through the titan's refusal to rule.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctively lyrical, with rhythmic control evident in phrases like "like ink bleeding through parchment." Elision in time jumps is taught and paid off at closure, and the titan's perceptual signature remains consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, as in "graceful collapse of a lie," and propulsion is maintained even in reflective moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes exile and subtle rebellion in a fresh, non-obvious way, with the rune of drift and ink pellet transforming familiar tropes. Risk-taking in the quiet, resolution-avoidant ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
