<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to collect fragments of erased histories is clear and consistent, embodied in actions like sitting for three tides beside a child's shoe. His interiority is concrete and character-particular, with no stock phrasing. The final choice to keep collecting represents Earned Stasis, foreclosing other paths with visible cost in his isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is Earned Stasis as Elias resolves to continue layering whispers, with cost legible in the bureaucratic erasure and his solitude. Orientation is clear early, and the poison label serves as a persistent constraint charging the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the port's containers and tides constraining Elias's movements and choices. The environment pressures tactics, such as forcing him upward during high tide, and the poison label recurs to charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes around preserving erased histories escalate through density increase under the Accumulative lens, driven by Elias's agency in collecting fragments. Cost is legible in his renunciation of normal life, with one meaningful tightening when he dedicates time to the child's shoe.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of erasure and memory emerges organically through images and actions, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "the nameless were not gone," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature filtered through Elias's consciousness. No head-hopping; elision and compression are taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats, supporting propulsion without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing bureaucratic error with textural preservation of memories. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
