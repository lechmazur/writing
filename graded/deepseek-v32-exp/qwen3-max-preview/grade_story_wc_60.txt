<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. The final action of opening the box is earned by prior causality, and the cost is visible in the empty box and city's change. However, lacking deep internal contradiction limits the score slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as memories liberate and silence deepens into presence. Cost is legible in the box lightening and the fountain's sigh. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the city of forgotten fountains and stained glass box constraining choices and charging the final image. Details are integrated into action, such as the breadcrumbs guiding movement, and spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of memory liberation escalates through protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with each breadcrumb deepening pressure. Cost is unmistakable in the released memories and box emptying, though no major reversals occur.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory and liberation emerges organically from events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the city's silenced reverence. Subtext operates in gestures like the geese listening, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical, precise perceptual signature. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and purposeful elision (e.g., geese pausing) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, advancing story without muddle, as in "trapped auroras" and "defiant hush."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of skepticism and memory liberation, with specific details like the stained glass box and breadcrumbs. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
