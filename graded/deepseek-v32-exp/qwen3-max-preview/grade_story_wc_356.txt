<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elira's motivation for serenity within motion is clear and consistent, driving her actions; her olfactory sensitivity and journalizing are concretely embodied, and her final recognition of wisdom in chaos is earned through prior causality. However, internal contradiction is subtle rather than sharply dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost when Elira inhales the corpse flower's stench and recognizes truth; the accumulative/textural lens holds, reinforced by the village's change. The seed's dormancy and bloom shape tactics, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory detail filtered through POV; the treetop village and greenhouse constrain choices by hosting the seed, and the corpse flower charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elira's professional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elira's agency under the accumulative lens, as the seed blooms during the village's doubt crest, leading to her realization; cost is legible when she smells the truth and the village transforms. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom flowing from chaos emerges through events and images, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the corpse flower's lesson. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a poetic, perceptual signature; diction and rhythm control heighten pressure, as in "the flower unfurled like a velvet scream." No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm with clear propulsion; minor overwriting in phrases like "velvet scream" does not obscure closure. No loops or scaffold issues, and figurative language is purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of herbalist trope with unique elements like corpse flower and doodling method feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity anchors universals.</comment>
