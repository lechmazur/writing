<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's grief and motivation are deeply embodied through specific actions like delivering letters and stacking stones. His internal conflict between silence and connection is shown, not told, with micro-choices under pressure. The final shift to "luminescent ache" is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his ritualistic acts. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration where Elias's internal change is legible. The lamp flickering out and back serves as a pattern break that reweights stakes. Cost is felt in the "luminescent ache" image, and orientation is clear early. Persistent constraints like the sea glass shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices, such as the haunted lantern room influencing Elias's rituals. The sea glass and stones function as micro-settings that constrain actions and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through POV, avoiding generic description. Environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of loneliness and connection escalates under accumulative lens through Elias's agency when the lamp flickers, prompting his stone-stacking ritual. Cost is legible in his emotional shift from sharp ache to luminescence. One meaningful tightening deepens the stake without multiple reversals. Resolution is earned through renunciation and endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of shared healing emerges organically from particulars like the letter chain and sea glass, without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, such as the stone messages. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "luminescent ache" image. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical yet controlled prose. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, as in the humming motif. No head-hopping or register drift. Elision is purposeful, such as the anonymous letters, and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is elegant and dense, with varied syntax and rhythm that accelerate with scene needs. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; metaphors like "feathered tax collectors" are coherent. Information density is high, with every sentence advancing story or atmosphere. Read-aloud ear test passes smoothly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of grief and quiet hope through specific rituals like the letter chain and stone stacking. Tropes are transformed with emotional truth, avoiding template plots. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative narrative heightens stakes without gimmickry. The closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
