<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in poetic defiance; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "fingers, pale as moonlit parchment"). The final choice to unlock echoes is earned by prior causality, with cost in her refusal to conform. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions in restraint and revelation are shown in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost ("memory given motion"); the accumulative/textural lens holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the prism's unlocking reweights options. Persistent constraint (the lullaby of conformity) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful (silver courtyard, prism sanctuary), with sensory detail selective and integrated. The prism as micro-setting constrains choice (untangling threads) and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harvesting echoes to defy silence) is signaled early; escalation is driven by protagonist agency in untangling threads, with cost legible in the release of echoes. Under accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of resistance and resonance emerges from events and imagery, not statement; the ending offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in gestures like "armor woven from solitude," avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct poetic perceptual signature; voice is consistent and rhythmic under pressure. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (e.g., "between sigh and smile") is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; figurative language is coherent and pattern-taught. No loops or scaffold; clarity is maintained in peak beats (e.g., "The harvest of echoes spilled outward").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of concepts (chaste courtesan, harvest of echoes) feels inevitable; poetic risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
