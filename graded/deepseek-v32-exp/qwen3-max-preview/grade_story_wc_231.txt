<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in decoding rather than justice or grief. His interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like the crackling Edelweiss. The final choice of silence is earned by prior causality, though minor lack of internal conflict prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in "Some truths belong to the sea." The accumulative drive lens holds, building through sensory details. Orientation is clear early, and the constraint of observing gaps shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the opal dock and mist constraining Silas's choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "salt and silence" are selective and reflect POV bias, integrating into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the accumulative lens through Silas's agency in investigating gaps, leading to the memory shard. Cost is felt in his renunciation of reporting, narrowing options with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of borrowed memories emerges implicitly from events and images, with subtext in the Edelweiss as a signature. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and purposeful elision (e.g., gaps) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and enhances clarity, even in peak beats like the memory sensation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of detective tropes through sensory decoding feels inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, with specific details like the Edelweiss charging closure.</comment>
