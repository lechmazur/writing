<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in her hesitation to take the name Lirien; final choice is earned by prior causality and forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when she takes the name and the ship trembles, with felt cost under the accumulative/textural lens; orientation is clear early, and lens holds consistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with the carnival ship and garden pressuring tactics through vivid, purposeful sensory details; micro-setting (emerald card) alters options.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in her hesitation and the name's acquisition; dominant stake (recapturing selves) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of identity and freedom emerges through events and images, with ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer ("I am both, and neither, and all") that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a poetic perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure and purposeful elision (e.g., narrative threads) are taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with no muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of chimera twin, carnival ship, and forgotten names; risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
