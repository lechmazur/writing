<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The knight's interiority is concrete and embodied, with his withdrawal and murmured allegiance motivating his ritual; his transformation from withdrawn to unfolded is earned through sequenced surrender, with visible cost in his liberation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, with cost legible in the knight's harmonization and the dawn of a new grammar; orientation is clear early, and causality holds through pattern-building.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like mercury roots and phosphor-bark integrated into action; setting pressures the ritual and enables the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the knight's agency under the accumulative lens, with stakes tightening through his movements; cost is visible in his unsnapping and the environment's response, foreclosing his prior state.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of possibility emerges through images and actions, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the knight as a conduit, avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with poetic diction and rhythmic control under pressure; perceptual signature is strong, and elision in the ritual is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language serving the tone; minor overwriting in dense imagery is voice-motivated and does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of knight, alchemy, and marionette ritual feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and transformation is grounded in character.</comment>
