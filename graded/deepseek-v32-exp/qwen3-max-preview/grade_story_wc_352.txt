<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and micro-choices like tracing the sigil. Her fractured cognition and competence are consistently shown, and the final choice to awaken the Seed is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction is minimal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change and cost as the chamber seals, under a causal lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the gravity inversion persistently shapes tactics, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto and inverted gravity environment constrain choices and charge the final image, with vivid, purposeful sensory details integrated into action. Phosphorescent moss and threshold effects pressure Elira's progression.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elira's agency under the causal lens, from decoding eyes to seizing Fragment Delta, with cost legible in visions and chamber sealing. One meaningful tightening forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of vigilance seeded in margins emerges organically through events and images, with a resonant non-literal answer in the Seed's awakening. Minor moralizing in the final paragraph slightly reduces score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature that reflects Elira's prism-minded nature. No head-hopping; purposeful compression and elision are taught and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and enhances clarity without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of archivist tropes with gravity inversion, transformed through specific details like the margin doodle. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
