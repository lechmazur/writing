<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to defy hopelessness is clear and intensifies, driving her choices; interiority is concrete through embodied actions like chanting and filtering awareness. The final renunciation of the kerosene rag is earned by prior causality with visible cost, though lacking deep internal contradiction limits the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as the mosaic absorbs the rag and a star appears, reweighting hope with felt cost; the accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with the mosaic sequence providing coherent escalation and persistent constraints shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the blooming fortress constraining choice through the mosaic's precise steps; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, charging the final image with phosphorescent dust and stamen-lanterns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency in dancing the mosaic sequence, tightening options under the accumulative lens; cost is legible when the rag is absorbed and the star holds, foreclosing a path with visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of defying despair emerges organically through images like the mosaic and star, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext operates in gestures like the rag's dissolution into song.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic, rhythmic prose; perceptual signature is clear in Lira's filtering of ambient awareness, and elision (e.g., mosaic's song) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with strong rhythm and propulsion, though minor overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., "petals that curl from mortar cracks like slow-burning fuses") slightly dulls peak beats without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes fireworks design with magical realism in a fresh, non-obvious way; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes, and the closure image feels inevitable through specific particulars.</comment>
