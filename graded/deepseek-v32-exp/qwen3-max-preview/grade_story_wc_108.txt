<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied ("heart hammering," "knees cracking"), with motivation rooted in betrayal driving higher-stakes choices. The final transformation—burning the film to achieve liberation—is earned by prior causality, and contradictory impulses ("trembling certainty") act simultaneously in scene. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost ("the fire spreads slowly, respectfully"), under a hybrid causal-textural lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the plot escalates via because/therefore linkages from decoding to burning the film. Persistent constraint of betrayal shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting ("rusted library under stars") is vivid and sensory, pressuring choices by housing the decoder cast and projector. The seashell and cast as micro-settings constrain actions and charge the final image. Details are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of liberation escalates under the hybrid lens through protagonist agency—decoding notes and burning the film—narrowing options with unmistakable cost (library consumed). Pressure tightens coherently from discovery to action, avoiding coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of transformative betrayal and vulnerability as power emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("The softest parts hold the sharpest truths") that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature ("move like fear given legs"). Voice modulates rhythmically under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., shell whispers) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and legible, though slightly dense in peaks ("painted the rusted library in flickering gold"). No coherence issues or artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes betrayal and adaptation with a fresh, non-obvious angle (stunt double using seashell and cast). Tropes are transformed through specific details, and risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
