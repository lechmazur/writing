<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in the poet's "savage need"; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (trembling fingers, certainty like a seed); final choice to "Unfold" is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens, with cost legible in the quartz dimming and the world remembering to listen; orientation is clear early, and lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the quartz colonnade and frozen lake constraining choice and charging the final image; sensory details are purposeful and integrated with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (to touch the untouchable) escalates through poet's agency under accumulative lens; cost is unmistakable in her surrender and the environment's response, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of freedom and expression emerges from particulars like "paraphrase the divine"; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice has a distinct perceptual signature with rhythmic control; poetic diction is consistent and heightens pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; minor overwriting in figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off, with no loops or artifacts harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details like "lantern-moth hush"; risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
