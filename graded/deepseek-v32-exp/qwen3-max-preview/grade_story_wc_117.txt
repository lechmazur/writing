<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her past, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as not panicking during the eclipse and instead singing. The final passing of the curl is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the shared stillness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the hair curl's passage, under an accumulative drive lens that holds. Orientation is clear early, and the eclipse integrates seamlessly without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "crushed sage and slow-burning cedar" constraining choice and charging the final image. Sage Ridge functions as a micro-setting that alters tactics and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency in responding to the eclipse, under the accumulative lens, with cost visible in the shared stillness and curl's passage. One meaningful tightening deepens the stake of nurturing wonder.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of ordinary magic emerges through events and images, not statement, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext operates in gesture and silence, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is lyrical and consistent, with purposeful elision taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and supports peak beats without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style heightening stakes. Specific details transform familiar tropes through character and setting.</comment>
