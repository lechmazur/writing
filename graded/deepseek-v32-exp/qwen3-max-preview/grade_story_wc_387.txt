<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final stance of witnessing hidden effort is earned, though interior contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in the whispered "I see you" and fading footprints, under an accumulative/textural lens that holds. Orientation is clear early, and the resonant reconfiguration charges the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens through density increase and cadence shifts, driven by protagonist's agency in whistling and acknowledging hidden labor. Cost is legible in the final whisper.</comment>
