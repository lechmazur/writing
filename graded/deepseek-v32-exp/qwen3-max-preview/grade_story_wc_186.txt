<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied with clear motivation intensifying under pressure; micro-choices like adjusting the tripod reveal values, and the final conduit realization is earned by prior causality with visible cost in weeping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost felt in the custodian's weeping and the prism's pulse; orientation is clear early, and causality holds from star-tracking to vision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices through the collapsed pavilion and glass hum, charging the final image; sensory details like powdered silica and wind are selective and POV-filtered, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is agency-driven under the Accumulative lens, with the custodian's star-aligning tightening stakes; cost is legible in the vision's fragility and her emotional response, foreclosing paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally from images like the shard of hush and thistle-blown hope, offering a resonant answer to meaning in patterns without moralizing; subtext deepens through retrocognitive echoes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice has a distinct perceptual signature with poetic rhythm control under pressure; POV is stable and elision is taught, with diction matching the custodian's worldview and no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats like the prism's glow, maintaining clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-collapse mysticism and stellar retrocognition feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming familiar tropes.</comment>
