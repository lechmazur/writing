<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and drives the narrative; interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., "her gloves trembling only slightly." The final choice to subsume remorse is earned through prior struggle, with visible cost in "hollowed but whole." No stock phrasing or diagnostic labels undermine peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orientation is clear within 120 words; accumulative/textural lens holds, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). Cost is legible in "hollowed but whole" and "contagion spent." The pavilion's discovery and transformation are tightly linked to Elira's agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and POV-filtered, e.g., "rain-slicked ruin" and "coral icebound pavilion." The environment constrains choice by forcing tactile interaction and charges the final image with "petrichor and possibility." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict with remorse) escalates under accumulative lens through density increase in emotional absorption. Agency is clear in her choice to touch the pavilion, with cost unmistakable in "hollowed but whole." One meaningful tightening occurs at the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of transforming grief emerges organically through images and actions, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "petrichor and possibility" reweighting prior salt and silence. No moralizing; subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature e.g., "taste memories" and "liquid shadow." Rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping. No dialogue, but internal coherence is maintained under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, e.g., "She sanded. She ground each jagged recollection." No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; clarity is preserved in peak beats. Sentences advance story and atmosphere concisely.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable, e.g., chef tasting memories and coral pavilion storing remorse. Risk-taking in accumulative style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passed; emotional specificity avoids templates.</comment>
