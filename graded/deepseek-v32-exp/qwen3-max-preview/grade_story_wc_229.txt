<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in observed trauma; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion like blistered fingers and shallow breath; final choice to use the cork is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her relief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost ("relief, thick as honey"); causal lens holds strong from motivation to outcome; orientation is clear within first paragraph with who, where, and when anchored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory with purposeful detail like peeling paint and jasmine scent; the cobalt lighthouse and cork constrain choices and charge the final image, affecting tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of guiding ships escalates through Elara's agency using the cork; cost is legible in her relief and the ships' turning; causal pressure tightens options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of whispers over shouts emerges organically from events and images; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the sea sighing and ships humming, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct with lyrical perceptual signature; voice controls rhythm under pressure; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; clarity and propulsion maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of magical realism and character-driven stakes feels inevitable; specific details like cork from lightning-struck tree transform tropes; lyrical risk-taking heightens coherence.</comment>
