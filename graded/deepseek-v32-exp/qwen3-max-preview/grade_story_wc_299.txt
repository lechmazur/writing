<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Jasper's characterization is deeply embodied, with internal conflict shown through specific micro-choices like holding the cloth to his ear instead of measuring it. His motivation intensifies under pressure, leading to an earned renunciation of emotional insulation with visible cost. The trait "confidently uncertain" is dramatized in his shift from factual calibration to embracing uncertainty, fulfilling the quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Jasper types "Project Echo," reconfiguring his purpose with felt cost. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The final image of him listening charges the ending with conceptual cost, satisfying the quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The quarry office trailer and speaker cloth constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory detail filtered through Jasper's POV. The setting pressures his isolation while the valley's acoustics directly shape his epiphany. The cloth's transformation from calibration tool to tuning fork demonstrates specificity that passes the quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens occurs through density increase as the cloth's altered perception triggers Jasper's agency, leading to his decision to start the project. The cost is legible in his tightened throat and pulse thudding with possibility. This meaningful deepening reweights the stake in purpose discovery, meeting the quick test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the speaker cloth and valley echoes, offering a non-literal answer to finding meaning in fragments.

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, evident in professional lexicon ("acoustic transparency coefficient") and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful elision in backstory is anchored to present stimuli and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift, satisfying the quick test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "echo valley longing" is coherent and voice-motivated. Sentences advance story and character simultaneously, with clear propulsion in peaks like the decision to type "Project Echo." Quick test met with zero artifacts in closure.</comment>
