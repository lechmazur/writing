<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and intensifies; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, and the final renunciation is earned through prior causality with visible cost in the surrender of the apron's glow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost under the accumulative/textural lens; orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the mirrors shapes tactics.</comment>
