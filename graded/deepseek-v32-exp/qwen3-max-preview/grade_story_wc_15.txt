<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Weaver's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, driving higher-stakes choices; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, though lacks deep contradictory impulses. Final choice to mend the plate is earned with visible cost in labor and ancestral gravity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the plate's transformation and canyon's response. Orientation is clear early, and structure coheres in a single scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices—the labyrinth and plate function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by weaver's agency in sewing, under accumulative lens; cost is felt in the effort and transformation, narrowing options toward reverence. Stakes are dominant and coherent, though pressure builds gradually rather than through sharp turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images—broken precedents becoming sacred blueprints—without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the child and storm stepping out, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure supports accumulative design. No head-hopping, and elision (e.g., sleepwalking paths) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density, but minor overwriting in figurative language slightly muddles peak beats. No major loops or artifacts; rhythm varies naturally, and closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in fresh synthesis—weaver mending memory into stone—with risk-taking in lyric style. Concept feels inevitable in hindsight, and specific details avoid tropes, though closure relies on familiar transformation arc.</comment>
