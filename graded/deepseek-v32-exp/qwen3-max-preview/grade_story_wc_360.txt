<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., using halo fragment). Interiority is concrete, but internal conflict is more summarized than dramatized in scene. Final renunciation (walking away) is earned with cost, though some telling reduces impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with cost (halo dims, she walks unnamed), under Accumulative lens. Orientation is clear early; structure uses mosaic shards taught by pattern. Cost is legible in final image, and lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with topaz workshop and halo fragment constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered. Atmosphere supports theme through consistent, tactile imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens through borrowed personalities and halo use, driven by protagonist agency. Cost is legible in halo dimming and unresolved empathy. Stakes tighten meaningfully, though some beats are summarized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of emotion as mathematics emerges through events and images, not statement. Ending offers resonant non-literal answer with final glyph. Subtext in ambiguity and glyphs; no moralizing, complexity embraced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic and consistent, elision taught and paid off. No head-hopping; prose reflects character's mind under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and serves theme. No obscurities in peak beats; craft supports closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of transposed empathy and mathematics of emotion, transformed through specific details. Risk-taking in structure and style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
