<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's "logically emotional" trait is embodied through vibrational syncing and adaptive choices under pressure, with interiority shown in concrete actions like breath and heartbeat matching. Micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final transformation to "keeper of balance" is earned by prior causality. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws are balanced with competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hybrid drive lens (causal and accumulative) holds strong; closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost ("she sank to the floor, exhausted"). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality links ice's song to scavenger attack and resonant resolution. Key lock and vibrational matching pay off earlier setups without retroactive patches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (ice guides steps, marina feels "reverent") and charges the final image with the Heartstone's pulse. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV (e.g., "breath misting in salt-laced air"). Spatial choreography is coherent, and the drift-ice marina evolves from graveyard to alive under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protecting Heartstone) escalates through protagonist agency: adapting to ice, then countering sonic harpoons with vibrational matching. Cost is legible in exhaustion and transformed role. Under hybrid lens, pressure tightens from environmental harmony to external assault, resolved by her mediation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of harmony vs. violence emerges through events and images (e.g., sonic absolution transmuting dissonance), not direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via "consonance" as strength. Subtext operates in vibrational language and ice guidance, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature ("logically emotional mind calculating resonance thresholds"). Voice is poetic yet consistent, blending technical and mystical lexicons. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., key's purpose) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("gentle as a mother’s lullaby, fierce as a glacier’s birth") is purposeful and coherent. Sentences advance story momentum; no register drift or artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sonic fantasy and literary style feels inevitable; vibrational matching and "fleshly ethereal" tone heighten stakes. Tropes (lighthouse keeper) are transformed through specific logic and moral calculus. Risk-taking in hybrid structure pays off with clarity.</comment>
