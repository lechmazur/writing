Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost in the reaper's weeping and the atlas page's pulse. The structure coheres through symbolic actions, and orientation is clear early. The drive lens holds without contradiction, shaping the final image.</comment>
