<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits of hearing unspoken words and craving reprieve; interiority is concrete and embodied (e.g., "chest echoed like a cathedral of unfinished hymns"); final action of tracing stars is earned by prior causality with visible cost (weeping, spent state).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with felt cost under accumulative lens (voices released, she weeps and rests); orientation is clear early (who, where, when anchored by ~120 words); structure builds coherently through density increase to climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory with purposeful detail (aurora archway, frozen stone); astronomical instrument and archway constrain choices and charge the final image by enabling the tracing action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes (freeing trapped creativity vs. personal pain) are signaled early; escalation driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens (voices grow furious, she traces stars); cost is legible through weeping and spent state.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and imagery (stardust, constellations); ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through silence and harmony after release, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct with poetic perceptual signature (e.g., "moonstruck dreamer," "constellations only she could see"); no head-hopping or register issues; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and dense with high information density; no loops or scaffold issues; metaphors serve accumulative style without muddle in peak beats (e.g., climax tracing).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific with non-obvious synthesis of creativity and stardust; tropes transformed through grounded details (instrument, archway); risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
