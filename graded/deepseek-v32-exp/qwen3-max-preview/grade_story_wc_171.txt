<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion shown through actions like clutching the clipboard and kneeling. Her internal conflict about past failures intensifies under pressure, compelling her to muster conviction. The final choice to use ritual is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the mustering of peace after decades of war. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her voice carrying "neither triumph nor despair," reinforcing her complex characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot follows an accumulative/textural lens, building through ritual imagery to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where soldiers sign the treaty, reconfiguring peace with cost felt. Orientation is clear early with who, where, and when anchored. The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and closure lands on-page with Elira's smile signaling a charged poise. Persistent constraints like the clipboard and terrace shape tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details like "volcanic stone" and "scent of burnt sage" filtered through POV. The ancient terrace constrains choice by serving as the ritual site, charging the final image where moons cast halos over the battlefield. Micro-setting elements like the ebony clipboard are integral to action and closure. Spatial choreography is coherent, with bodies and objects tracking cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of peace is signaled early and escalates through Elira's agency under the accumulative lens, with one meaningful tightening as she writes the treaty and soldiers respond. Cost is legible in the "shattered remnants of her own conviction" and the blending of thumbprints into a "mosaic of consent." Protagonist-driven escalation narrows options, foreclosing the path of continued war with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of redemption's price emerges through events and images, not direct statement, with subtext in gestures like pressing her palm to the page. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the ritual's success, reweighting prior failures without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, such as the clipboard etched with failed treaties. Thematic resonance is built from character struggle and closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, evidenced by poetic diction and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, such as the "operatively gentle cadence" reflecting Elira's state. Purposeful compression in lyrical passages is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is legible and supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; metaphors like "shield and scripture" are purposeful and coherent. Line-level craft is flawless, with clear propulsion and strategic telling that compresses backstory without momentum loss. Read-aloud ear test passes with natural variation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of peace negotiation and ritual, transforming tropes with specific, grounded choices in character and setting. The core concept of redemption's price feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in lyrical approach heightening stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth and human complexity avoid generic templates, supported by vivid details like the "iridescent ink." Bold choices cohere into a singular artistic stance.</comment>
