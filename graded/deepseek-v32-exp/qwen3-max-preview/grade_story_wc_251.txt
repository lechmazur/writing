<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and intensifies, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion; her final stance as "the soil" is earned by prior causality, though contradictory impulses are not deeply explored in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, cost legible in the town's shifts; orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobalt library and grotto constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details are vivid and purposeful, with spatial choreography coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elira's agency under the accumulative lens, cost felt in characters' whispered realizations; stakes tighten meaningfully from windows to spectral arbors.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of quiet rebellion emerges through images and events without moralizing; the ending reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity, such as "the forest of second thoughts."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic rhythm; perceptual signature is strong, and elision is taught and paid off, though minor register consistency questions arise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no major artifacts, but slight figurative density in peaks may mildly obscure clarity without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grotto and rebellion feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors universals.</comment>
