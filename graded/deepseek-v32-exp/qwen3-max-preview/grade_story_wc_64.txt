<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The gardener's motivation is deeply rooted in embodied grief, with micro-choices like tracing the tapestry and stitching with her own thread revealing a hierarchy of values. Her final shift from lullabies to questions is earned by prior causality, with the cost legible in her weeping and the silo's release. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her blithe exterior versus internal recognition of shared choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where intentions are reweighted as gestures, with cost felt in the gardener's transformed perspective and the silo's exhale. The Accumulative lens holds, building through image density and cadence shifts. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the tapestry's unraveling drives a coherent tightening that forecloses her prior stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The cobalt silo and tapestry function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image of thresholds. Sensory details like "dew-damp grass" and "liquid twilight" are selective and POV-filtered, woven into action. The sovereign case and needle evolve tactically, altering stakes without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by the gardener's agency in decoding threads, deepening the stake of understanding grief. Cost is legible in the silo's trembling release and her emotional shift. A meaningful tightening occurs as each unraveled thread narrows options, culminating in the realization about intentions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the tapestry's knots and the needle, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to intentions as messy gestures. Subtext operates through image and implication, such as the sovereign case holding "dust" instead of confessions. No moralizing; the ending reweights prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that biases observation toward grief and curation. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in phrases like "threads curling like smoke," and any elision (e.g., the silo's origin) is taught and paid off. Voice remains coherent through emotional peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language like "liquid twilight" is purposeful and consistent, though minor overwriting risks exist in dense metaphor clusters. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the decoding beats, clarity intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes cemetery tending with metaphysical exploration in a non-obvious way, transforming tropes through specific details like the tapestry decoding. Risk-taking in lyric heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable from established pattern. No derivative echoes.</comment>
