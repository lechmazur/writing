<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final acknowledgment of the ghost is earned by prior causality, and his observational trait drives key turns without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in the sigh and image of the ghost, under an accumulative/textural lens that holds. The discovery sequence is causally linked, and orientation is clear early, with no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details filtered through POV. The circus ticket office constrains choices (e.g., dust patterns leading to ceiling tile) and charges the final image, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency through observation and tool use, tightening the stake of discovery under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the ghost's acknowledgment and the weightless burden theme.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of ghosts as stories refusing burial emerges through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with closure for the living, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., dust patterns) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with purposeful figurative language. No major artifacts or loops; minor overwriting (e.g., "weightless burden") doesn't harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost-seeing through dust analysis feels inevitable, with risk-taking in accumulative design. Specific details (e.g., mainspring barrel) heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
