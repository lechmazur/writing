<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority (e.g., fingers twitching, tears sizzling) and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of suppression is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the lock snapping open and her transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost (lock opening, creativity uncorked) under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality is tight, with the cave's resonance driving the resolution without coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the crystal cave's auroral glow constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through POV, integrating into action and theme without generic elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of internal conflict between suppression and expression escalates under Accumulative lens through protagonist's agency (visualizing portraits, drawing wings). Cost is legible on-page in the lock's release and her transformation, foreclosing past paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of creativity as an unstoppable tide emerges through particulars (lock, cave, portraits) without direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the freeing of portraits, reweighting prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic and character-specific, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and serves closure, though slight density in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices (crystal cave, broken lock). Risk-taking in symbolic narrative heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
