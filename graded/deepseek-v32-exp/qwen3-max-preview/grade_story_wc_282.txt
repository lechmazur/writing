<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative from observation to participation. Interiority is concrete through embodied actions like pressing the fossil for calibration. However, lack of contradictory impulses in scene prevents a higher score, though the final choice is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as the leaf dissolves and her purpose is reconfigured, cost legible in the loss of the object. Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with causality building to the climax. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the fossil's role shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like bioluminescent lichen and damp stone, integrated into action and charging the final image. The coastal cave network constrains choices and responds to emotional heat, serving as a micro-setting that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, as she modulates her biothermal output in response to the leaf's float. Dominant stake of becoming a voice for the unknown tightens with a visible cost in the leaf's dissolution and her renewed purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of translation and memory emerges through images and events, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the leaf's transformation into motes of light, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, filtering details through thermal and emotional cues. Voice is poetic and controlled, with rhythmic prose that heightens pressure without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and consistent. Read-aloud test passes with clear propulsion, especially in peak beats like the leaf's float.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and organic, synthesizing post-human world with emotional mapping. The leaf's evolution from relic to relay feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors universals.</comment>
