<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elias's amoral philanthropy and secret sentimentality are concretely embodied through micro-choices like placing the egg and whispering the call, with the final release earned by prior causality and visible cost in his emotional shift ("felt clean").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the echo's absorption and Elias's transformation, anchored early in the salt flat setting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Salt flat environment constrains choice and charges the final image through sensory details like "cracks in the earth began to glow," integrating POV bias and thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, escalation is driven by Elias's agency in the ritual, with cost visible in the "echo fading" and his emotional cleansing; stakes deepen through density increase.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of atonement through echo emerges non-literally from images and actions, with the ending offering a resonant reweighting ("echo was enough") without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with lyrical, perceptual specificity ("the ghost of a bird’s song clinging to his collar"), and no head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or artifacts; figurative language coheres and propels momentum, e.g., "the cracks that remembered how to hold beauty."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of amoral philanthropy with ecological atonement feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet, lyrical closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
