<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's claustrophobia and motivation are embodied and drive micro-choices; final renunciation is earned with visible cost in the spent gold fleck and emotional weight. Interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing, and the resolution forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the gold fleck's disintegration and "heart heavy with quiet triumph"; accumulative/textural lens holds via pattern of memory and resonance; tidal constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice via tidal timeframe and facility decay; sensory details (salt, humming cables) are purposeful; recurring objects (gold fleck, drawing) charge the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (standing by the unremembered) escalates under accumulative lens through protagonist's agency (using fleck, activating machine); cost is unmistakable in the fleck's destruction and emotional toll at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance emerges through particulars (child's drawing, ghostly figures) without moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the conceptual repricing of "witness" and carried silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; lyrical prose reflects character's mindset under pressure; elision (e.g., grandfather's journals) is taught and pays off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold issues; figurative language ("live wire sparking against stone") is consistent and purposeful, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (metaphysical phase transitions, undersea cables) feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; specific details anchor universals.</comment>
