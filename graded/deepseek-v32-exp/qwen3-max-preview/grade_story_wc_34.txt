<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority; the balladeer's loneliness and desire for connection drive consistent micro-choices, and her final decision to build a bridge is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her tears. Contradictory impulses of isolation and yearning act simultaneously in scene, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the ghost's response and her decision to invite others reconfigure meaning with felt cost ("tears fell... from the tinkersong wonder"). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices; the misty courtyard and terminal constrain action, and the bolt plate as a micro-setting object charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven through action with POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from personal encoding to communal invitation with cost legible in the emotional release. Stakes of belonging deepen through a meaningful cadence shift that reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the encoded messages and ghost's reply, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to loneliness without moralizing. Subtext operates through image and implication, with earned wisdom from concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that modulates under pressure. Purposeful compression and lyrical diction are taught early and pay off at closure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with clear propulsion in peak beats like the encoding sequence and ghost's response.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes ghost-in-code and balladeer with unique specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
