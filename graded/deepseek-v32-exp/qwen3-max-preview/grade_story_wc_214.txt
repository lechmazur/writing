<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The janitor's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices. His shift from archivist to janitor is earned, and his empathy drives key turns, though deeper flaws or contradictions are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as the comet's efflorescence and the janitor's tears reconfigure meaning. Cost is legible in the "unrecorded peace" and his emotional response, with orientation clear early and lens held throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting—station, lantern glass, cosmic elements—constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "velvet dark" and "wind-chime sensors" woven purposefully. The lantern glass as a micro-setting object actively shapes perception and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on finding strength in vulnerability, escalating through the comet's arrival and the janitor's empathetic tracing. Under the Accumulative lens, density increases with the comet's efflorescence, and agency in empathy drives the climax with visible cost in his tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of flourishing stillness and strength in vulnerability emerges through images and events, not direct statement, with subtext in the comet's "silent bloom" and the janitor's recognition. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice and rhythmic control under pressure. Perception is character-specific, as in "filtering the streaks into golden threads," and elision is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "sky wept embers" is coherent and purposeful, and closure is sharpened by precise imagery without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of a cosmic janitor finding meaning in vulnerability is a fresh synthesis, transformed through specific details like the lantern glass and comet's efflorescence. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
