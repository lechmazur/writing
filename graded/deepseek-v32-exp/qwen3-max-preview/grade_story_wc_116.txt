<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The keeper's motivation to witness change is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion shown through trembling and weeping. The final softened state is earned by the refuge experience, foreclosing a path with visible cost. However, some passivity in agency slightly limits the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure is Earned Stasis with felt cost in the keeper's alteration ("softened, like wax"). Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres through the journey into the refuge and back, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (moss, scrolls, beetle wings) are purposefully woven into action. The library and refuge constrain choices and charge the final image, with environment shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative lens, stakes escalate through density increase in the refuge experience, driven by keeper's agency in unfolding the swan and kneeling. Cost is legible in the altered state, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of change and observation emerges organically through images and events, with subtext in silence and decay. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material with exquisite fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Poetic prose is consistent and voice-motivated, with purposeful elision in folds and silence taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with varied syntax and clear propulsion; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and supports peak beats, though minor overwriting risk in dense imagery doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystical archive and existential themes, with specific, irreplaceable elements like the origami swan. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
