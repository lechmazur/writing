<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying as she discovers the letter. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion shown when she weeps silently. Her stoicism yields to sensitivity, earning the final clarification. Micro-choices under pressure reveal her values, and the resolution forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara feels "clarified" and the pavilion "sighed." Cost is legible when she weeps and the inkwell empties. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the structure coheres with one meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "brackish water" and "crusted barnacle-crowns" woven into action. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the setting evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving memory against oblivion escalates under the Accumulative lens through discoveries like the doll and letter. Protagonist agency drives deepening, with cost legible in her weeping and the inkwell's emptying. One meaningful tightening forecloses options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and absence emerges through particulars like the notes and letter, not direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the pavilion holding "witnessed absence." Subtext operates in gestures and silence, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "silt that had settled for decades, swirling like ghosts." Voice is poetic yet controlled, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "algae-streaked steps" is purposeful and clear. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs, and closure image is undulled by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes surveyor and archeologist of dreams with fresh, non-obvious angle. Specific details like the inkwell and notes transform familiar tropes. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
