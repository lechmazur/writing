<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and bottomless, driving sanctification action; interiority is concrete through embodied perception (e.g., "pulse of floorboards"); micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values; final endurance earned by prior causality with visible cost in cottage unclenching.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in "vanished cottage finally unclenched its ghostly fingers"; orientation anchored early; displaced object method shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting (bay, reeds, streetlights) is vivid and sensory-selective; environment constrains choice (shard placement on moss-slick stone) and charges final image; POV filters details through character's perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honoring memory) escalates under Accumulative lens via protagonist's agency in sanctification; cost legible in cottage's release and bay's deepened lullaby; one meaningful tightening forecloses path with felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (memory, reverence) emerges organically from particulars like orris root and vanished houses; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext operates in imagery and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature biases noticing toward atmospheric details; no head-hopping; rhythmic control under pressure supports closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "silence pooled like spilled ink"); clarity and propulsion uphold closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of memory and normality through specific details (orris root, sanctification); risk-taking in lyrical design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; transformation of tropes via character-driven choices.</comment>
