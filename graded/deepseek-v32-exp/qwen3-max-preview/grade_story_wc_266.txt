<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Characters show concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, with motivation clear and aligned with actions. Elira's humming and Torvin's listening reveal character-particular traits, and the final vigil earns endurance with visible cost. However, contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene, preventing the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in the shared burden "stitched with starlight." The accumulative lens holds, with pattern taught early and orientation clear. The ridgeway's whispered detours and star-punch holes create a coherent drive to the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the veiled ridgeway constraining choices through indirect routes and listening to the land. The final image of the child's shoe and whistle charges the closure, and sensory details like "moss-slick railings" are purposefully filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the accumulative lens through the guides' agency, culminating in the discovery of artifacts and vigil. Cost is legible in the "shared, sanctified" burden, and the dominant stake of finding courage tightens meaningfully. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images and events, with the ending offering a non-literal answer: "Courage doesn’t rust... It waits." Subtext operates in gestures like punching stars and the vigil, resisting moralizing. The reweighting of prior material is earned through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature, e.g., "listening for the absence of voices." Rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping. Elision in the ridgeway's paths is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "roots that curled like question marks" is coherent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive, and closure is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of courage as artifacts waiting, with risk-taking in the lyric structure. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, and specific details like the star-punch transform familiar tropes. Bold choices heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
