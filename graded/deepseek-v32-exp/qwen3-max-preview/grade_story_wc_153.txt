<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in memory loss and release of letters. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as trembling sweat versus fierce tenderness, enhancing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the dissolution of letters and planting of the shard. The accumulative/textural drive lens holds throughout, with orientation anchored early. The final image reweights options without exposition, and cost is legible in the "seed of stone" and new droplets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the mangrove labyrinth constraining choices (roots tripping, branches curling) and charging the final image. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, filtered through POV, such as "moss-slick roots" and "salt-thick air," evolving consistently with the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with stakes tightening through interactions with leaf-windows and release of letters. Cost is unmistakable in the loss of memories and letters, foreclosing paths. Pressure coheres and deepens with each beat, such as the shard pulsing "like a heartbeat restarting."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of apology and choice emerges organically through images and events, not direct statement, with subtext in leaf-messages and the shard's absorption of sorrow. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final droplets tasting "of salt and forgiveness," avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with a consistent perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. POV is stable and single, with purposeful compression in phrases like "the moment before deciding." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "knit them closed with fierce tenderness." Momentum is maintained through concise, image-driven sentences, and no artifacts obscure clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Story synthesizes elements with originality, such as the mangrove labyrinth and leaf-windows, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details like the gargoyle shard are irreplaceable and charged with cost.</comment>
