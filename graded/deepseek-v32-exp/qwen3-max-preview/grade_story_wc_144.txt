<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her trait of decoding failure into direction. Her calm under pressure and embodied perception through blindness show concrete interiority. The final choice to repair the drone is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the saved research.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with cost: the drone flies, voyage proceeds, and orchids unfurl. Causal lens holds strong from repair process to resolution. Orientation is clear early, and the anchor's groan escalates pressure meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like dew and light refraction constraining choices. The depot's pulse and tools like the basin charge the final image, integrating environment into action and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear: repair drone before tide turns. Escalation via the anchor's growing groan creates time pressure. Protagonist agency drives the repair, with cost legible in the unfurling orchids and proceeding voyage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of mending trajectories emerges through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the drone's flight and orchids, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature through Elara's blindness. Voice is poetic and consistent, with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet clear, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language serves purpose without muddling peak beats. Propulsion maintains momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of blind artisan, hummingbird drone, and light refraction method feels organic and inevitable. Specific details and risk-taking in voice heighten stakes without obscuring clarity, offering a fresh angle.</comment>
