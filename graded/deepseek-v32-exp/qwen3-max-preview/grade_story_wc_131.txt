<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying to compel higher-stakes choices. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to not emerge yet but feel resonance is earned by prior causality with visible cost (tears streaking dust).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost on-page ("tears streaking dust on her cheeks"). Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening through the object returns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory detail filtered through POV. The library environment and objects (tape fragment, cache items) constrain choices and charge the final image, shaping tactics and resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (visibility vs. invisibility) escalates under Accumulative lens through protagonist agency (leaving objects), leading to a deepening that changes knowledge and options. Cost is legible in the warmth spreading through her ribs and the staff notice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of visibility as resonance emerges through events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a non-literal answer through the final image of quiet return, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and consistent, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; elision and compression are taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is voice-motivated and clear, though slightly dense in peaks, but no clarity loss at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of invisibility and connection through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry; premise feels inevitable in hindsight with transformative details.</comment>
