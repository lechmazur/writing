<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., hands shaking, cautious exuberance). The final choice to perform the symphony is earned by prior causality, foreclosing the path of silence with visible cost. However, internal contradiction is more trait-based than simultaneous impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a Resonant Reconfiguration (silence shifts from abandonment to awe) and felt cost (chiming ink well, falling dust). Causal lens holds strong from deciphering to performance, with orientation clear early. Persistent constraint of acoustic resonance shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory (dust-laden air, vaulted ceiling), constraining choices through archive acoustics that charge the climax. The ink well and chandelier recur with reweighted meaning, integrating environment into action and theme without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring trust escalates through protagonist agency from deciphering to performing, with cost legible in the risk of semantic dissonance. One meaningful tightening occurs as the performance tests promises, narrowing options and altering knowledge under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of trust and harmony emerges through particulars like musical notation and interconnected promises, not statement. The ending offers a non-literal answer with the silence of awe, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and image (e.g., ink well chiming).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (lyrical, professional lexicon). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (curator's warning), and prose rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping. Purposeful elision (e.g., Syrathi history) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied syntax without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "dust fell like snow"), and read-aloud rhythm accelerates with scene needs. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of linguistics and music ("symphonies of truth"), transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in structure and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
