<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply realized with clear, conflicted motivation; interiority is concrete and embodied, such as the ghost mimicking past gestures. The final renunciation of regret is earned through prior causality with visible cost, satisfying the quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost via the ghost's photo and message, reconfiguring the narrator's stance under the accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the final image making cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the silent lagoon and central spire charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, with the environment actively shaping the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes are dominant and internal, escalating through the protagonist's agency in collecting fragments and interacting with the ghost. Under the accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, and cost is unmistakable in the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and the final message, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to regret without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and images, such as the camera reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a perceptual signature, evident in the narrator's selective attention to echoes and fragments. Voice is coherent under pressure, and any elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing momentum without obscuring clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of regret and self-haunting, with risk-taking in structure and concept that heightens stakes. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight and is fully committed to.</comment>
