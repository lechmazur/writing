<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and rooted in fidelity to the broken; her interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "laugh—a gritty, whiskey-rough sound"). Micro-choices under pressure, like broadcasting her song, reveal her values, though her steadfastness lacks deeper contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with her broadcast triggering a carrier wave, reconfiguring the conflict under a causal lens; cost is legible in her isolation and the storm's veil. The portico and radio persist as constraints shaping tactics, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the cobalt portico and stormlit observatory pressuring choices and charging the final image; sensory details like "frost-glazed metal grates" are woven into action, and the portico's harmonic lattice is indispensable for the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes between individuality and collective harmony escalate through Elira's agency, from decoding messages to broadcasting; cost is visible in her effort and risk, and the climax narrows options under the causal lens with a meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from prophetic fragments and Elira's actions, resisting moralizing; the ending image of "unfold shadows into wings" offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinctively poetic and gritty with stable POV; rhythmic control under pressure and perceptual signature (e.g., "static bloomed into syllables") are consistent, and any elision in prophetic fragments is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no major artifacts; minor overwriting risks ("oracle bones tossed by a drunken god") don't harm closure clarity, and propulsion is maintained through concise, image-driven sentences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and well-integrated, with specific details like meteor dust ink and AI ghosts avoiding cliché; the synthesis of prophetic decoding and ideological conflict feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in voice heightens stakes.</comment>
