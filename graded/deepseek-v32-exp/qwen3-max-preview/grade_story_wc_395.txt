<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with compelling interiority and micro-choices (e.g., lying to pursue the investigation). Her transformation into an anchor is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her continued attention and deception. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her self-deception about archival curiosity versus descent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she becomes the anchor for the lost crew, with felt cost in her perpetual vigilance. Causal drive lens holds strong, with her actions (triggering the restore) leading to the climax. Orientation is clear early, and the ending reweights options without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and constrains choices, such as the archive enabling the resonance trigger. The patch as a micro-setting object charges the final image and shapes tactics. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, reflecting POV bias in the dim terminal and humming servers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from investigation to triggering the restore, narrowing options and changing knowledge. Cost is legible in her altered role and lies. Dominant stake (finding the truth) tightens meaningfully, with no coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and absence emerges organically from events and images, such as the patch and resonance. Ending offers a non-literal answer through the conceptual repricing of deletion as lingering presence. Subtext operates in silences and gaps, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and close third-person, with distinct perceptual signature in the poetic, attentive voice. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, e.g., in the climax description. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., gaps in posts) is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "resonance chamber." Sentence rhythm varies naturally, supporting momentum without obscuring clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of digital ghosts and corporate euphemism feels inevitable, with risk-taking in structure and concept heightening stakes. Specific details (e.g., the patch, numbers) transform familiar tropes through grounded choices. Bold choices cohere without gimmickry.</comment>
