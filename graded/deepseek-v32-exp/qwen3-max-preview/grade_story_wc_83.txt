<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies from trauma to cartography of potential, with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., initiating simulations). Final endurance is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in her "brittle, broken" smile and whispered names.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise as she locks coordinates and leaps into the dark, reconfiguring options with cost legible in the geode's pulse and her whispered names. Causal lens holds strong from geode use to simulation outcomes, and orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory details (e.g., zero-gravity halls, geode's violet filaments) filtered through POV, with the geode as micro-setting constraining choices in simulations and charging the final image. Setting pressures tactics via isolation and resources.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding meaning escalates through protagonist's agency in running simulations and pursuing coordinates, with cost legible in her emotional state and the geode's responses. One meaningful tightening occurs as she queues thrusters under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging meaning from loss emerges organically through events and images (e.g., geode pulses, hunt for pools), with subtext in whispers and bleak exhilaration. Ending offers resonant, non-literal reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control under pressure (e.g., "drifting through the floating observatory’s zero-gravity halls"). Perceptual signature is character-specific, and elision (e.g., trauma memories) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dense, propulsive prose with varied syntax and high information density, no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "pooling in the hollows between seconds"), enhancing clarity without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of trauma, sci-fi, and metaphysical hunt feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details (e.g., geode from crater). Risk-taking in style and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
