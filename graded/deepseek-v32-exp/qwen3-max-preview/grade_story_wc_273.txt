<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices like spilling ink deliberately. However, internal contradiction is minimal, lacking deep conflicting impulses in scene, though serene anger adds nuance. Final choice to disappear is earned through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost as the tracker vanishes, reconfiguring time perception. Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern-building. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraints (ink, time slowing) shape tactics. Cost is legible in the disappearance image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like wind-carved encampment and ink spill constraining choices and charging the final image. Micro-setting (ink, drone) alters tactics, and environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, from investigation to ink spill revelation. Cost is unmistakable in her disappearance, foreclosing options. Dominant stake (understanding time) tightens meaningfully with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on time and crisis without moralizing. Subtext in ink patterns and disappearance reweights prior material, embracing complexity through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Poetic, voice-motivated diction remains consistent, and purposeful elision (ink vanishing) pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythm and no major artifacts. Minor overwriting in figurative language is pattern-taught and serves accumulative design, without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (tracker, drone, ink) feels inevitable, with fresh angle on time perception. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and transformation of tropes through specific detail.</comment>
