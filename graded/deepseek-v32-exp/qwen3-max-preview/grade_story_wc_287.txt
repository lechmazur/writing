<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority; the gardener's motivation evolves from personal loss to active hope, evidenced in micro-choices like prism placement. Emotions are tactile (e.g., "knees aching, palms smudged"), and the final stance of "measuring hope by millimeters" is earned through prior causality. No stock phrasing or diagnostic self-awareness undermines the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly, building through imagery to a Charged Poise closure where the city's "reverence" reconfigures stakes. Orientation is immediate, and cost is legible in the gardener's physical exertion and emotional resolution. The lockmaster's tooth as a persistent constraint shapes tactics without forcing doors open.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the fire escape and harbor moonlight constraining choices (e.g., prism angles on railings) and charging the final image of "sapphire and amber" alleys. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding generic description. The environment actively pressures the protagonist's moves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes of instilling resilience escalate under the Accumulative lens through the gardener's deliberate actions, each prism placement deepening textual density. Agency drives the escalation, with cost visible in her aching body and the community's awe. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the final reweighting feels earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fragile beauty emerges through particulars like the rosebush's "crimson sigh" and prism reflections, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the child chasing light, reweighting prior material without statement. Subtext operates in gestures and objects like the lockmaster's note.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature ("rhythm of oars in water") that modulates under pressure. Voice controls rhythm and diction without head-hopping or register drift. Elision (e.g., the lockmaster's vanishing) is taught and pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful (e.g., "moonlight fractured into a dozen trembling beams"). Rhythm accelerates and breathes with scene needs, and closure image is undulled by overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of urban gardening, light reflection, and locksmith lore feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is transformed through specific, lived detail and a non-obvious moral calculus on hope.</comment>
