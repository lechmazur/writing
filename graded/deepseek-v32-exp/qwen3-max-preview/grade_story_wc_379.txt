<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to place the locket in the mailbox is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in Leo's weeping. Contradictory impulses, such as her patience versus active seeking, are shown in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with cost as the humming softens and Leo weeps, under a causal lens that holds throughout. The mailbox as a persistent constraint shapes tactics and the final image, with orientation anchored early and no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the courtyard and locket constraining choices and charging the closure. Details like the jasmine scent and iron gate are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's POV, and the mailbox functions as a micro-setting that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes of unresolved grief escalate through Elara's agency under the causal lens, driven by because/therefore linkages like humming leading to Leo's door. Cost is legible in Leo's emotional release and the softened humming, with one meaningful tightening that narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of listening healing grief emerges through particulars like the locket's humming and mailbox, with subtext in gesture and silence. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer in the softened humming, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct with lyrical control and rhythmic variation under pressure. Dialogue is natural and sparse, carrying subtext, and elision is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, especially in peak beats like "fluttering like a trapped wing," and sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief and magical realism feels inevitable, with risk-taking in quiet resolution heightening stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details like the off-key humming transform tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
