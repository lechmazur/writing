<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion. Micro-choices under pressure reveal values, and the final act is earned by prior causality. However, lacks deep contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens; the blackout lifting and implied change reweight stakes. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the sundial and quill holder shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the luminous fort and blackout pressuring choices and enabling the protagonist's actions. Sensory details are purposeful, and the environment constrains choice, charging the final image through the coded angles and fading light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silent revolution) escalates through protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens; her actions narrow options and carry visible risk. Cost is legible in the meticulous planting of seeds, though the escalation lacks a dramatic turn, capping the score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from symbols and silence, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to revolution through geometry. Subtext operates in implication, and the ending reweights prior material without moralizing, supported by the cradle of sparks concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature that reflects the protagonist's mindset. Voice modulates with pressure, and elision (e.g., coded angles) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, and sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs. Closure image remains clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of silent revolution via geometry is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Specific details (sundial, quill holder) and risk-taking in structure heighten stakes without gimmickry, demonstrating authentic vision.</comment>
