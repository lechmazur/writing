<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The calligrapher's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and micro-choices (e.g., building puppets after the argument) revealing a hierarchy of values. Interior contradictions are shown in his shift from moral evasion to accountability, earned through prior causality. The final choice to return to Mira is motivated by his earned serenity, with visible cost in the transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as he decides to return to Mira, reconfiguring his stance under a causal lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible in "his serenity wasn’t cultivated—it was earned." The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and the story follows Track A with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with the radar dome and campfire stick actively shaping tactics. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV (e.g., "rain drummed against the curved steel shell"). The environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from realizing moral evasion to performing puppet shows despite violence. The dominant stake (ethical storytelling) tightens through his choices, with cost legible in the turning point where "violence as punctuation" alters tactics. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the puppet shows reweighting truth, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the calligrapher's realization about accountability. Subtext operates in gestures and implications, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature that reflects the calligrapher's mindset. Voice modulates under pressure (e.g., "half-lit epiphanies"), and any elision is taught and paid off. Rhythm and diction control heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (e.g., "stories burn twice"), and sentence-level rhythm varies naturally. Minor overwriting in dense metaphors does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes elements uniquely, with a non-obvious angle on ethical storytelling through puppet shows. Turns feel earned in hindsight, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The combination feels organic and inevitable, supporting closure.</comment>
