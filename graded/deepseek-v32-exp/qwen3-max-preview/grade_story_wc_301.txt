<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies through methodical mapping; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "wept with raw solace"); final choice to map through neglect is earned by prior causality with visible cost; contradictory impulses act in scene, such as clarity arriving in "jagged bursts" alongside disciplined documentation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as she inkes a route "through the heart of her own neglect," charging the final image under an accumulative/textural lens; orientation is clear within 120 words; cost is legible in the "echo and the ivy" shifting for her healing; the lens holds without ambiguity, with persistent constraints like the patched accordion shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated, with the station and ivy acting as archive and crucible that constrain choices (e.g., graffiti clues direct her path); sensory details are selective and purposeful, such as "air thick with moss and memory"; the environment charges the final image through the rearranged ivy, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of self-forgiveness escalates under accumulative lens through protagonist's agency, such as discovering graffiti that deepens her mapping; cost is unmistakable in her weeping and the accordion's "wheezing gasps"; one meaningful tightening occurs at "Point Zero," foreclosing external direction and turning inward with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars like graffiti wisdom and emotional topography, avoiding direct statement; subtext operates in images like the accordion's sighs and ivy as archive; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "path scribbled in bathrooms," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a perceptual signature biased toward emotional cartography; voice is controlled under pressure, with rhythmic prose like "each step a note in a dirge"; purposeful elision (e.g., graffiti phrases) is taught early and pays off at closure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated (e.g., "contour lines of shame"); sentence-level propulsion accelerates with emotional beats, such as the minor scale "shuddering through the empty station"; no artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of self-forgiveness through mapping and graffiti feels inevitable in hindsight; specific details like the patched accordion and ivy as archive transform familiar tropes; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure reconfigures meaning with bold specificity.</comment>
