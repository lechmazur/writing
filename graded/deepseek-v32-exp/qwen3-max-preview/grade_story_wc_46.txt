<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "damp knees and calloused palms"). Micro-choices under pressure, like polishing the glass, reveal hierarchy of values. Final endurance is earned by prior causality with visible cost in memories.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with felt cost as the sea glass reflects light, reconfiguring her purpose. Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with memories tightening stakes. Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting (serpentine grotto, mist) constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details filtered through POV (e.g., "mist curled like sleeping dragons"). Sea glass as micro-setting alters tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict over trauma and vow) escalates through accumulative density of memories and polishing. Agency in endurance drives deepening; cost is legible in solace offered to villagers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (stillness as strength, light without fire) emerges through particulars like sea glass polishing; subtext in gesture and image. Ending offers non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic yet consistent; dialogue (child's line) is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and clear; read-aloud test passes with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma and rebellion through specific details (sea glass, grotto). Risk-taking in quiet narrative heightens stakes; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
