<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in harvesting insights from failure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., trembling fingers from precision). Final renunciation of the flute is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost as she leaves the flute and becomes a keeper of thresholds. Accumulative/Textural lens holds, orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful (e.g., Thunder-echo Range, driftwood markers), with sensory detail integrated into action. Environment constrains choice (driftwood arrangement) and charges the final image (flute as monument).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harvesting insights) escalates through protagonist agency (uncasing flute, stepping through). Under Accumulative lens, density increases with her journey, and cost is legible when she leaves the flute spent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from events and images (e.g., leaving the flute, codex on ethics). Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control (e.g., "avalanchingly quiet"). Voice is poetic yet precise, and elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, and peak beats avoid muddle (e.g., "world flickered. Not a rupture. A seam.").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of failure and mystical insight, with specific details (e.g., collapsed realms) transforming tropes. Risk-taking in quiet ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
