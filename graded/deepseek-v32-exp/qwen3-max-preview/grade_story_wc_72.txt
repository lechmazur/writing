<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The historian's embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as hesitating before breaking the ampoule, reveal a credible arc from certainty to nuance. The statue's incisively kind telepathy constrains interactions, earning the final choice with visible cost. Minor archetypal traits in the historian prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual repricing as the historian's realization reweights the city's fall into transformation, cost legible in the statue's dissolution and her new purpose. The accumulative/textural lens holds through cascading revelations, and the ampoule's structural weakness shapes tactics decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The underwater garden constrains choice (e.g., pressure suit, breaking ampoule against statue's weakness) and charges the final image with stirring coral and revealed mosaics. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, reflecting the historian's awe-driven perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, from retrieving the ampoule to breaking it, forcing a trade-off between dogma and nuance with cost in the statue's dissolution. The dominant stake of truth versus fluidity tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the glyphs and garden's awakening, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to certainty versus mystery without moralizing. Subtext in imagery (e.g., coral as transformed citizens) deepens reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending poetic description and telepathic dialogue that advances plot. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, such as in the historian's gasped thoughts, and elision (e.g., the city's history) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and propulsion without loops or scaffold, though minor mixed metaphors ("scalpel dipped in honey") slightly muddle peak beats. Sentence rhythm varies naturally to support revelations.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes with non-obvious angles (inoculation against dogma, fluid transformation) through specific world logic and character choices. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
