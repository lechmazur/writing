<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The poet's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. Her ethically playful trait constrains actions, and the final renunciation of the rope carries visible cost, earning the change through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (village weaving the bridge), under the Accumulative/Textural lens held throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the rope as a persistent constraint shapes tactics, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the grotto and rope functioning as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV bias to mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by poet's agency under the Accumulative lens, from personal reflection to communal action, with cost legible in her forfeiture of the rope. The dominant stake (understanding choices) tightens meaningfully, reweighting options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the rope and Silas's story, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to impossible choices without moralizing. Subtext operates in imagery and implication, with earned wisdom from concrete experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful compression (e.g., "texture of time") is taught and paid off, and elision enhances clarity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the revelation scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of familiar concepts (impossible choices, energy beings) made specific via character and stakes. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens meaning, and the transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
