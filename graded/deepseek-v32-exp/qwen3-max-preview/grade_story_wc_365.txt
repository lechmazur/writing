<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and intensifies, driving her to higher-stakes choices. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion like tracing the floor and weeping. The final realization is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her emotional response. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; micro-choices under pressure reveal her values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly with because/therefore linkages: shard use enables transition, leading to truth discovery. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—Elira's weeping and responsibility realization. Orientation is clear early; persistent constraint (shard) shapes tactics. Cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like oily floor and dust motes filtering through Elira's POV. The repair bay and shard constrain choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; details evolve with the transition to Sigma-7. Economy of detail supports momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering truth) escalates through Elira's agency under causal lens: shard use, universe transition, and data core touch. Cost is unmistakable in the emotional weight of knowing. One meaningful tightening forecloses options and forces a trade-off. No coincidence; resolution earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of truth and responsibility emerges from events and images, not direct statement. Subtext operates in the revelation about her mother. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars; ambiguity lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic yet consistent, reflecting Elira's specialized perception. No head-hopping; purposeful compression enhances density. Elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats. Read-aloud flow is smooth; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting in phrases like "cyclically spontaneous" but no clarity loss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of parallel universes and sensory mapping, transformed through specific character choices. Emotional truth is specific and avoids templates. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight; elements are organic.</comment>
