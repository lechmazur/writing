<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prophet's motivation is vividly embodied and drives the climax; Kael's role supports without overshadowing. Micro-choices under pressure reveal values, and the final toss of the mallet is earned by prior causality with visible cost in exhaustion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with felt cost (exhaustion, transformation) under an accumulative/textural lens; orientation is immediate, and structure coheres without causality breaks, with the persistent constraint of turning obstacles into instruments shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is integral to action, with the orchard afloat and sea constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, reflecting POV bias and enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Prophet's agency under the accumulative lens, with the darkening sea tightening pressure and cost legible in exhaustion and transformation; stakes are clear and interwoven with theme.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of turning obstacles into instruments emerges organically from events, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through harmonic rain; no moralizing, and subtext operates in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistently poetic with distinct perceptual signature (clouds as music); POV is stable and rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity, and any elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and coherent, supporting momentum without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Concept is uniquely synthesized with inevitable feel; risk-taking in accumulative structure and lyrical execution heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure reweights prior material with originality.</comment>
