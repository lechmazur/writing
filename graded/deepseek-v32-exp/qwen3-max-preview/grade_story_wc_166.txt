<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in rebellion against the nostalgia ban, with embodied emotion shown through dance and physical sacrifice. Interiority is concrete, but internal conflict is underdeveloped, lacking contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Final choice to teach villagers is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her completion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost legible in her bleeding feet and collapsed completion. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity, reinforced by the villagers' arrival and her decision to teach.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice, as the twilight garden under stars provides the space for her dance and charges the final image with the villagers' approach. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven through action to support atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, from finding the moonstone to dancing until completion, with cost unmistakable in trembling muscles and bleeding feet. Stakes tighten meaningfully, though the middle lacks a sharp reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and rebellion emerges through concrete actions and images, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the villagers' response. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping. Dialogue, though minimal, is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language serving pressure and closure. Minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "gravitational sighs and stellar sighs" risks coherence) but no loops or scaffolds that obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes nostalgia ban and tide dancer with specificity, transforming tropes through grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyric design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
