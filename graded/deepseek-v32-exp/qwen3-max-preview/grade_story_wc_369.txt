<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The worker's motivation is clear and rooted in arboreal curiosity, with interiority shown through embodied actions like feeling the sextant's grief. Her shift from fixing to following is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her transition to pilgrim. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as patience versus urgency, culminating in a credible renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where she becomes a cartographer of sorrow, with cost felt in her altered stance. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through imagery and emotional density. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern pays off without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like damp stone and stormlit tower, selectively filtered through the worker's POV. The sextant and trees function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image, essential to the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering tree-witnessed sorrow escalates under the accumulative lens through the sextant's healing and dream projection. Protagonist agency drives the deepening, with cost legible in her decision to follow, foreclosing the path of repair.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of sorrow and memory emerges organically through images like trees absorbing dreams, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the worker's mapping, reweighting prior material with meaningful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic yet grounded prose. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision (e.g., the astronomer's fate) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity without muddle in peak beats like the sextant's projection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes quantified sorrow and arboreal witness with originality, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure effect remains legible and coherent.</comment>
