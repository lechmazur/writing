<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to archive rather than heal is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority (e.g., "dread pooling in her ribs") and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation (sovereignty without healing) is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the closure. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as resolve amidst dread, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost ("not healed, not whole, but sovereign"), under an Accumulative/Textural lens that holds. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the seashell as a persistent constraint shapes tactics. The vow and shell's silence mark completion with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (velvet garden, weeping willow) is vividly sensory and purposeful, constraining choices by housing quarantined memories and charging the final image. The shell and garden function as micro-settings that alter tactics, with details like "petals that sighed" filtered through POV. No generic descriptions; spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (archiving memories for sovereignty) escalates under the Accumulative lens through density increases in memory revelation. Protagonist agency drives tightening, with cost unmistakable in the renunciation of healing. The vow and harmonic surge represent a meaningful deepening that forecloses alternatives.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (translating isolation into independence) emerges organically from particulars like the seashell and archiving act, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through "fluency in its language," reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures and images, such as the shell's exhale.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, e.g., "resonance structures unfold" reflecting the skeptic's mind. Purposeful compression and poetic diction are taught and legible, with no head-hopping. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, supporting closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language (e.g., "petals sighed like forgotten lullabies") is consistent and clear, even in peak beats. No artifacts obscure causality or closure; sentence-level propulsion is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes memory archiving with resonance structures in a non-obvious way, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Specific details (seashell half, velvet garden) and emotional specificity avoid tropes. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise is transformed through grounded choices.</comment>
