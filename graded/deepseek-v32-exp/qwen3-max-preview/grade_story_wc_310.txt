<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as "the stellar doubt that pulsed behind her ribs." Final choice to stop drawing lots is earned by the vision and realization, with visible cost in her trembling and scattered coins.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change where she embraces purpose without lots, landing with cost under a hybrid accumulative/causal lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the vision triggers a coherent turn that reconfigures stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the ambered observatory deck and coins constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "frozen in honeyed light" are filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding meaning escalates through the static burst vision, driven by protagonist agency. Cost is legible in her trembling and the scattered coins, forcing a trade-off that forecloses her prior reliance on chance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of meaning in entropy emerges through events and images, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "we’re the distillate," avoiding moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like pressing the drachma to her forehead.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and close third, with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic prose like "a lullaby hummed by a universe remembering how to breathe." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, though slightly dense in peaks, but clarity remains untouched at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes entropy, prophecy, and meaning in a fresh, non-obvious way. Risk-taking in structure and tone heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
