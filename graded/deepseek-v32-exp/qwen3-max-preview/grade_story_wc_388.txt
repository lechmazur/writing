<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, driving key choices like pressing the diamond into the soil. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion (e.g., trembling from thrill). Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final commitment to continue is earned by prior causality with visible cost (sorrow for buried truths).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost (sorrow and determination). Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from reassembling letters to discovering the plaque. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of the diamond shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the orchard and diamond constraining choices (e.g., clearing the storm) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, reflecting urgency and professional bias. The environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from reassembling letters to using the diamond and finding the plaque. Dominant stake (truth vs. lies) tightens meaningfully, with cost legible in sorrow and renewed resolve. No coincidence; turns narrow options and deepen knowledge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images (e.g., diamond as tuning fork, reassembling truth). Subtext operates through implication, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The final image reweights prior material with conceptual cost (smothered truths).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that reflects the protagonist's observational bias. Voice is controlled and rhythmic under pressure, with purposeful compression (e.g., "Truth is not found. It is dug."). No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level craft supports momentum without obscuring causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes fresh, non-obvious angles on familiar tropes (conspiracy debunker in wasteland). Specific details (Stillpoint, reassembling letters) feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure and voice heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure effect is legible.</comment>
