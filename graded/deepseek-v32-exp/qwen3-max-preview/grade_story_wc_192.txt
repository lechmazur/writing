<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and rooted in embodied emotion; interiority is concrete with micro-choices under pressure, such as trembling knuckles and deliberate breath. The final choice to step through the threshold is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the release of the doorknocker. However, some abstraction in the "teaching suffocation to breathe" concept slightly limits immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens, with the threshold dissolving and her step into the lantern-field reweighting stakes. Cost is legible in the doorknocker's clatter and the sanctuary's sigh. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, though causality is minimal but appropriate for the mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the charcoal dust under bare feet and the sanctuary's evolving breath charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, with starlight pooling and ash stirring, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of overcoming suffocation escalates through protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with her press against the door and scar-linking deepening pressure. Cost is felt in the threshold's surrender and the lesson's completion, though stakes remain somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions, such as the dissolving threshold and the final line on suffocation, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and gesture, with earned wisdom from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and deep, with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control under pressure, evident in phrases like "bare feet whispering over charcoal dust." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off at closure, though occasional ornate diction may slightly distance immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, as in "stitch pulled from a fraying tapestry." Momentum is maintained, and closure image is clear, though slight overwriting in peaks exists without harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of concepts like linking through scars and teaching suffocation to breathe feels inevitable in hindsight, with specific details and bold lyrical risks that heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation of tropes through grounded choices avoids derivativeness.</comment>
