<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with embodied emotion under pressure. The final choice to graft legacy onto redemption is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the ritual. Micro-choices, like handling the coin, reveal a hierarchy of values. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the graft ritual. Orientation is clear by ~120 words. Cost is legible in the lagoon's hum and the figure's formation. Pattern of memory shards is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the obsidian lagoon and black sand constraining choices and charging the final image. Details are filtered through POV, like the sand "whispering of lava cooled." Spatial choreography is coherent, and environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconciling legacy escalates through emotional deepening under accumulative lens. Protagonist's agency in the graft ritual narrows options with cost legible in the lagoon's response. No coincidence; pressure coheres from established pattern.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of scars singing emerges through events and images, not direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the graft ritual and final image of coin pulsing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and close, with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic yet grounded, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., memory shards) is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "like whale-song trapped in glass." Sentence propulsion aligns with scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of firefighter/arsonist's daughter feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric structure heightening stakes. Core premise is transformed through specific detail and emotional truth. Turns are earned from character choice, not late rule changes.</comment>
