<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in legacy; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "trembling fingers"); final choice to seal truth is earned by prior actions with visible cost ("staggered back, spent"). Contradictory impulses act in scene, aligning with quick test for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost ("truth, made luminous"); causal drive lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages; orientation anchored early ("iron gate of the lighthouse prison"). Persistent constraint of mistrust legacy shapes tactics, and cost is legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful ("lighthouse prison," "jagged reef"); sensory details selective and integrated with action; environment constrains choice (lattice mechanism) and charges final image (light holding voices). Meets 9+ test by shaping closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. disbelief) signaled early; escalation driven by protagonist agency under causal lens (using lattice to summon witnesses); cost unmistakable ("heart hammering," "spent"). Agency narrows options and reweights stakes with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (lattice, light fractures) without moralizing; subtext operates in image and implication; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer ("Truth, made luminous"). Earned through specific events and character struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited; voice has distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control ("copperlight repose," "wind gnawed"); diction consistent and voice-motivated. No head-hopping; elision taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold; figurative language coherent and purposeful (e.g., "hover, suspended like a held breath"). Clarity and propulsion maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise offers fresh synthesis of cry wolf legend with generational twist; tropes transformed through specific choices (lighthouse prison, lattice); risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
