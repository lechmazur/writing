<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as when she feels the "cold brass bite" of the stamp. The final choice to witness and speak is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in her resolved stance. Contradictory impulses are less prominent, but micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she verifies the truth and resolves to speak, with cost felt in the "weight of what stillness had preserved." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory details and pattern breaks. Orientation is anchored early, and the Master Index revelation pays off established set-ups without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and constrains choices, such as the moss-slick shelves and hidden vents preserving the Master Index. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the protagonist's perception. The environment charges the final image, with the library's submersion acting as a tactical silencing that shapes the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering truth escalates through protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, as her discoveries narrow options and deepen knowledge. Cost is legible in her resolve to "carry not just facts, but the weight of what stillness had preserved." One meaningful tightening occurs when the Master Index reveals deliberate erasure, foreclosing passive acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth and stillness emerges organically through events and images, such as the contrast between "silence" and "testimony." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the final image of "truth reclaimed." Subtext operates in implication, like the ledger entries revealing elite stockpiles.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and close third-person, with a distinct perceptual signature in the protagonist's "tranquilly perceptive" lens. Voice modulates under pressure, and elision (e.g., the blackout) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction remains within the character's lexicon, even in peak beats like the Master Index discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, such as shadows that "moved like hesitant thoughts." Syntax varies naturally, and clarity is maintained even in climactic beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of ideas, with the sunken library and logical indexer transforming familiar tropes through specific detail. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The closure feels inevitable in hindsight, grounded in character choice and world logic.</comment>
