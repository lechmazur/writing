<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The seer's motivation is clear and rooted in embodied pain, with micro-choices like tracing the stone revealing hierarchy of values. Final arrival is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in her kneeling and not flinching.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost felt in the stone stilling and her welcome of the past. Orientation is clear early, and lens holds without contradiction.</comment>
