<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion. The final choice to send the drone is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the heavier chest and emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the drone ascends, reconfiguring hope and cost. Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is clear early, and persistent constraints (drone border) shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "ozone and burnt sugar" constraining choices (arcade's power grid used for smuggling). The storm bottle charges the final image, elevating stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the causal lens, with tighter drone surveillance forcing a reroute decision. Cost is legible in the risk and emotional weight, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images and actions, not statement; subtext in gestures like Marla's nervous rhythm. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "broken promises learned to fly," avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with consistent POV and perceptual signature. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven; elision is taught and paid off in closure, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, e.g., "thunderstorm in a bottle," and propulsion is maintained through peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and ingeniously synthesized, with specific details transforming tropes. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
