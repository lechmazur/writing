<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is visceral and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion in the climax ("wept, not from sorrow, but from recognition"). The final choice to witness rather than rebuild is earned by prior causality, showing a credible renunciation with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with on-page cost in the weeping moment; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pattern-based revelation of the shadow's spiral. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the closure unit is legible with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image—the vault's damp stone and henge's alignment shape the shadow analysis. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, with the environment actively guiding the protagonist's tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, from footage comparison to dusk waiting, tightening the stake of interpreting silence. Cost is legible in the emotional payoff and foreclosed path, with one meaningful deepening that reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence as vessel emerges through particulars like shadow shifts and the map's tear, offering a non-literal answer at closure without moralizing. Subtext in the folded chapel image reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, precise diction reflects the protagonist's methodical curiosity. No head-hopping; purposeful compression in the shadow analysis is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold; figurative language ("silence was not void but vessel") is coherent and pattern-taught. No artifacts obscure causality or closure, and sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cartography, silence, and temporal analysis feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core concept transforms familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices in character and closure.</comment>
