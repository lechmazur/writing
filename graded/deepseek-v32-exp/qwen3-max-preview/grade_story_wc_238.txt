<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in regret, with embodied emotion (e.g., "she trembled") and micro-choices under pressure. Elias's response reveals character through torn dialogue. Final reconnection is earned by prior causality, with cost in the orchard's loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as they reconnect with flawed frequency, cost felt in the orchard's impending cutting. Hybrid lens holds with causal and accumulative elements. Orientation is clear early, and structure is tight with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (archive, orchard) is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "yellowed paper and forgotten crescendos" filtering through POV. The archive constrains choices and charges the final image, while the orchard tightens stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is emotional reconciliation, escalating through her apology and the induced currents method. Agency drives escalation under Hybrid lens, with cost legible in the "sour notes" and orchard's fate. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Themes of imperfect miracles and regret emerge through events and images (e.g., perfume bottle, induced currents), not direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with complexity, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (e.g., "You always hated metaphors"). Elision is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats. No scaffold or register drift obscures closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of gossip-column exorcist and imperfect miracles feels inevitable, with risk-taking in method (induced currents) heightening stakes. Specific details anchor universals, transforming familiar redemption tropes.</comment>
