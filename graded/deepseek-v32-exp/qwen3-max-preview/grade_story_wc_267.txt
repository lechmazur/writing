<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bellhop's interior conflict between safety and silence is embodied through trembling hands and micro-choices, culminating in an earned decision to reinstall the bolt. His motivation intensifies under pressure, with no stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies. The final choice forecloses the path of silence with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost as the piano note breaks the silence and the stain flushes gold, reconfiguring safety's value. The Causal lens holds tightly, with the bolt's removal and return driving because/therefore linkages. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress, piano bench bolt, and staircase stain constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details (e.g., "dust danced in the chandelier's glow") filtered through the bellhop's POV. Setting actively pressures tactics, such as the bolt preventing music, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of safety versus silence escalates through the bellhop's agency in reinstalling the bolt, narrowing options and altering knowledge under the Causal lens. Cost is unmistakable when music "shak[es] loose something long frozen," with a visible price paid in the risk to safety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the bellhop's struggle, with subtext in gestures like the bolt's hiding and the stain's shift. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the cost of safety without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the image of "space between notes."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature ("frozen hymn," "frostbitten hope") and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision (e.g., the concerto collapse) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats (e.g., "dust danced"), and propulsion remains clear, though minor overwriting ("seraphically mundane") slightly tempers the score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of silence, trauma, and music feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific choices like the bolt and nerve regeneration. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the final image recharges prior particulars with undeniable freshness.</comment>
