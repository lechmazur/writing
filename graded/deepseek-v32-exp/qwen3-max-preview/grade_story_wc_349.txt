<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vendor's motivation to unwrite herself is clear and drives choices; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, though minor stock phrasing in past roles ("daughter, debtor, deserter, dreamer") slightly limits uniqueness. Micro-choices under pressure, like incising the counter, reveal values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as vendor feels lighter by distributing her burden, with cost legible in "each gleam was a story unlived." Orientation is clear within 120 words, and structure coheres through patterned transactions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image; glass orchard library and bottled moonlight are tactile and pressure tactics (e.g., patron drinks beneath a forgotten tree). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vendor's need to unwrite herself) escalates under accumulative lens through transactions that deepen her void; agency in selling bottles forces trade-offs with cost visible in incisions and ledger entries. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of absolution through quantified absence emerges organically from images and actions, not statement; ending reweights prior material without moralizing, e.g., "choose your emptiness" as foundation for beginnings. Subtext operates in implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled, rhythm modulates with pressure (e.g., "wind carried half-sentences like fallen leaves"). No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("captured instants of lunar glow, suspended between tides and time") but no artifacts obscuring closure. Sentences advance story without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers fresh synthesis of familiar tropes (e.g., memory erasure) through specific world logic and character depth; risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
