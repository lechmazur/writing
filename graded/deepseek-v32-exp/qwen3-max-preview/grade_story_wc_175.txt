<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and devotional, rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (fingers trembling, brushing dew-slick stone). Micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values, and final renunciation (leaving the structure) is earned by prior causality with visible cost of ephemerality. No contradictory impulses in scene, but quiet endurance fits the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in dissolution ("rain would loosen the knots... only the memory of a shape"). Inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held throughout with pattern breaks (breeze stirring monarchs) reweighting stakes. Orientation clear by ~120 words; persistent constraint of ephemerality shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective (grotto, mist, ferns curling), sensory details purposeful and POV-filtered. Environment constrains choice (ancient stump as anchor) and charges final image (grotto blushing, peace). Spatial choreography coherent; micro-setting (moth wing, moss) alters tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honoring vanishing histories) escalates under accumulative lens via density increase in building process and cadence shift (breeze, monarch alighting). Agency in renunciation and endurance forecloses path with cost (temporary structure, no audience). Cost legible in dissolution and farewell.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of ephemerality and reverence emerges from particulars (moth wing, monarch migration, knots unravelling) without moralizing. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through final image (memory of shape) that reweights prior material. Subtext in gesture and silence (bow, not touching).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV stable third-person limited; voice distinct with poetic, perceptual signature (noticing silence, blushing stillness). Rhythmic control under pressure (syntax varies with cadence shifts). No head-hopping; elision (e.g., village elders memory) taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language consistent and purposeful (monarchs like embers, knotting air with intention). Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with closure; no register drift or muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ephemerality and devotion feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet, lyric approach heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details (moth wing, lichen spiral) transform familiar tropes through grounded choices. Closure integrates premise fully.</comment>
