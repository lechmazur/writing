<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like walking barefoot and sketching. Interiority is concrete with somatic markers and embodied emotion, culminating in an earned change where crying without counting tears forecloses a path with visible cost. The final choice is rooted in prior causality, and contradictory impulses act in scene, such as the freeze not from fear but stillness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, building through sensory details and internal realizations. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in "I let myself cry without counting the tears." Orientation is clear early, and the pearl of stillness reconfigures meaning without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the arboretum constraining choices like barefoot walking and sketching. Micro-setting elements (photograph, pearl) charge the final image, and sensory details (e.g., "wind-rattled glass," "damp soil") are filtered through POV bias, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency, such as the freeze leading to realization and crying. Cost is legible in the shifted weight of the photograph and emotional release. Dominant stake (internal conflict between trauma and healing) tightens through a meaningful deepening that reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of stillness within chaos emerges organically from images and events, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the pearl metaphor, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the photograph evolving from burden to compass.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "noticing: how moss climbs stone in spirals." Voice is lyrical and consistent, with purposeful compression and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story, character, and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; figurative language is purposeful, e.g., "pearl of stillness." Read-aloud ear test passes with natural modulation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of trauma recovery through specific elements (arboretum, pearl) feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed with emotional specificity, and risk-taking in quiet narrative heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh angle avoids template plots.</comment>
