<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices like carving proofs revealing hierarchy of values. The final shift from regret to integration is earned by prior causality, with cost felt when the die vanishes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the protagonist touches the reflection and loses the die, with cost legible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, driven by pattern and density increase. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The infinite staircase constrains choices and charges the final image, functioning as micro-setting that alters tactics. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV, with vivid imagery like "stone became liquid glass" mirroring internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, through actions like carving and speaking proofs, leading to a ripple event with cost when the die vanishes. Dominant stake (capturing missed opportunity) tightens meaningfully, foreclosing options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in the die and staircase motif. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer by weaving regret into progress, without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, philosophical voice that reflects the character's perception. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and purposeful elision (e.g., patterned proofs) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, enhancing clarity. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and no artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar ideas (regret, perpetual motion) with a fresh, non-obvious angle through specific character and setting. Risk-taking in style and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
