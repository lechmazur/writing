<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The glazier's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied micro-choices like dropping the stone revealing his values. However, the absence of on-page internal conflict or contradictory impulses under pressure prevents a higher score, as the characterization remains steady without deeper flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise with felt cost in the "noctilucent reckonings" reconfigure meaning, under a coherent accumulative/textural lens. The early orientation and taught pattern—from prism use to final image—ensure structural integrity without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details like "mist clinging low over the water" are selective and POV-filtered, with the prism as a micro-setting object that charges the final image by transforming the widow's window, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by the glazier's agency in dropping the stone, deepening stakes through spectral shards that reweight the mundane with legible cost, though the internal conflict lacks multi-layered pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images like the rings fracturing dawn's gold, with the ending offering a non-literal answer via "compass points" that reweight prior material without moralizing, achieving resonant subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature evident in phrases like "read between lines—not just in books... but in ripples," and rhythmic control under pressure, though no dialogue is present to test indirection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts; figurative language like "fracturing dawn’s gold into spectral shards" is purposeful and clear, avoiding loops or scaffold in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of observation and physics, with the glazier's specific perspective making the mundane feel inevitable and charged, though it leans on lyrical familiarity without major structural risks.</comment>
