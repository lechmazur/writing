<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elira's motivation to transform scars into stories is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices like humming the lullaby to prevent ink crystallization. Contradictory impulses of fear and hope act simultaneously, and the final renunciation of shame is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the scars becoming waypoints. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority is concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost when scars shimmer as waypoints, under an accumulative/textural lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of scars shapes tactics. The world's exhale mirrors Elira's transformation, reinforcing cost without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image: the floating rock platform vibrates and demands surrender, while sensory details like "ink the color of midnight moss" are filtered through POV. The body (scars) and object (quill) evolve tactically, with the platform's resonance altering Elira's options at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming scars is signaled early and escalates under accumulative lens through density increases in rune-writing and stress overcoming. Protagonist agency drives escalation via humming and superstitions, with cost legible in scars reconfiguring. One meaningful tightening forecloses the path of shame with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of alchemizing pain emerges organically from particulars like runes and rituals, with subtext in gestures and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing: "stories do not erase pain — they alchemize it." Earned through concrete struggle and imagery, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, e.g., "the ink softened. The rune deepened." Voice is poetic yet character-specific, with purposeful elision taught early. No head-hopping; syntax reflects Elira's mindset without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "wool soaked in honey" is coherent and purposeful, enhancing momentum without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with rune-writing, and closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of transformation ritual feels inevitable, with specific details like crystallizing ink and floating platform. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure reweights prior material with authenticity.</comment>
