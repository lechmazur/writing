<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion (e.g., trembling hands). Her final choice to redefine mercy is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the survivors' responses. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her gentle nature wielding justice, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with closure as a Conceptual Repricing where mercy is redefined, costing the old passive mercy. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the magistrate's whispered memory and survivors' actions. Persistent constraint of past trauma shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the plaza and mosaics constraining choices (e.g., tessera as compass). Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, charging the final image. The shattered sky and ash-laden air mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of redefining mercy escalates through Elira's renaming and the magistrate's confrontation, driven by her agency under the accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable in the survivors' participation and the foreclosed path of passive mercy. One meaningful tightening occurs with the crowd's response.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of aberrant mercy emerges through events and renaming, not direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the survivors' whispers, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like placing the tessera in the magistrate's hand.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Elira, with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic yet coherent, with no head-hopping. Elision in retrocognition is taught and paid off at closure, enhancing texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied syntax, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "ash clung like powdered grief." Rhythm accelerates with crowd participation, and closure image is clear without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concept of renaming mercy is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details like the blue tessera transform familiar tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
