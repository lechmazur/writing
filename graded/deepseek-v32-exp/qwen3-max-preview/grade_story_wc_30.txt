<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The librarian's characterization is deeply embodied, with her moon-phase attribute influencing micro-choices like blurred edges during waning, and her motivation to preserve wonder drives the narrative through concrete actions such as smelting the creel. Internal conflict is shown simultaneously through her questioning during new moons and acceptance of contradictions, earning the final endurance. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing; the emotional progression feels authentic and cost-driven.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) in the final image of wonder molting and migrating, legible cost in her softened certainty. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lunar constraint persistently shapes tactics. The structure's mosaic-like shards (atrium, pool, shelves) cohere under the lens, teaching its pattern early and paying off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the tidal atrium's bioluminescent tides and lunar quartz spectacles constraining choice (e.g., the pool revealing faces) and charging the final image of "today still gleaming." Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as salt-slick floors and algae pulses, avoiding generic description. The creel as a micro-setting object evolves tactically, deepening closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, stakes escalate through a single meaningful deepening—her acceptance of contradictions during the smelting action—which reweights the dominant stake of preserving wonder with cost legible in her "edges blur." Agency is clear in her decision to lower the creel, foreclosing static certainty. No coincidence; pressure coheres from identity migration to charged poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the creel's echoes and migrating identities, culminating in a non-literal answer that wonder "molts, moves, migrates" without moralizing. Subtext operates through images (e.g., the clock ticking backward) and the librarian's embodied realization. The final conceptual repricing reweights prior material with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature ("brass cogs ticking softly") and rhythmic control that modulates with pressure (e.g., shorter sentences at climax). No head-hopping; elision (e.g., "after tomorrow disappears") is taught early and pays off. Voice remains consistent under stress, with diction matching the librarian's specialized worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety, with sentences advancing multiple layers (e.g., "smelt the raw ore of experience"). No loops, scaffold, or overwriting artifacts; figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated. Propulsion is maintained even in reflective beats, and the closure image is sharpened by concise, vivid phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines through a non-obvious synthesis of mechanical and mystical elements (titan-gear librarian, lunar quartz), transforming tropes via specific details like the creel's evolving use. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the core concept of migrating identities feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth anchors the fresh premise.</comment>
