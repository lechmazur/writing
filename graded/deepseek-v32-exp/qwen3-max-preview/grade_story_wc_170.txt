<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied with consistent motivation, such as listening with the "hollow between her ribs," and the final calm smile feels earned by prior causality. However, minor lack of interior contradiction under pressure limits the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative drive lens holds strongly; closure lands with cost in the terrace's sigh and her vanishing, reinforced by the borrowed heartbeat as a persistent constraint. Orientation is clear early, and the resonant reconfiguration is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the prism parapet and mirrors constraining choices and charging the final image of doorways and horizons. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, as her humming triggers mirror revelations, with cost felt in the release and her departure. One meaningful tightening is sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of possibility emerges organically from images and events, offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the final seeding of "gentle fractures." No moralizing; subtext operates in implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic with stable POV; perceptual signature is clear in lyrical prose and rhythmic control. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, supporting propulsion without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Concept is highly original and well-synthesized, with the borrowed heartbeat and mirage painting feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
