<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by terminal curiosity rather than suicide, with embodied interiority like "hollow behind her eyes." Her micro-choices under pressure, such as climbing onto the floe, reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final renunciation of euthanasia is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with Elara's realization that endings are thresholds, felt cost in her changed actions. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory details to the glacier shearing, and orientation is clear early with who, where, when anchored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the drift-ice marina constraining choices (e.g., ice accepting Elara) and the parasol tip as a micro-setting object charging the final image. Sensory details like "groan of ice" and "wind carried whispers" are selective and filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hearing endings) escalates under the Accumulative lens through density increase, culminating in the glacier shearing. Protagonist agency drives escalation via her decision to climb the floe, with cost legible in her transformed perspective and declined euthanasia.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the parasol tip and glacier sigh, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on endings as thresholds. Subtext operates in images and actions, avoiding moralizing, and the final image reweights prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, lyrical rhythm, and purposeful compression. Voice remains coherent under pressure, with elision taught early and paid off at closure, and no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with zero loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, advancing story without muddle, and sentence-level propulsion supports the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of euthanasia tourism and Arctic acoustics, transformed through specific details. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
