<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ghost bride's motivation is clear and drives the plot, with Elara's rapid but earned realization through the bead's resonance. Interiority is concrete, and the final choice carries cost, though Elara's change could benefit from more contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, as the orchard awakens and Elara accepts the debt. Cost is legible in the final image of fruit and weeping, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting constrains choices (e.g., bead pressed to tree) and charges the final image with sensory specificity. Vivid details like "frost-laden winds" and "fruit the color of twilight" are purposefully woven into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the ghost bride's agency under the accumulative lens, culminating in Elara's acceptance and the orchard's awakening. Cost is felt in the transformation, though stakes could be more visceral earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of debt and heritage emerges through images and events, not statement, with the ending offering a non-literal answer. The final fruit with runes reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and lyrical, with a distinct perceptual signature in descriptions like "lovingly venomous echo." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic but clear, with varied rhythm and no major artifacts. Figurative language enhances momentum, though some sentences border on overwriting in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost story and alchemy feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style heightening stakes. The transformation of haunting into heritage is fresh and specific.</comment>
