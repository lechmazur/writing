<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and consistent, driving key choices like redirecting steam, but lacks on-page contradictory impulses, capping at 8.8 despite strong embodiment and micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in the terminal's pulsed renewal and Elira's continued work, under a coherent accumulative lens; the sextant's repurposing charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting vividly pressures choices (e.g., geothermal line discovery) and charges closure with the sextant's light patterns; sensory details are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is agency-driven under accumulative lens, as Elira's redirection of steam transforms stakes; cost is legible in the terminal's partial revival and her ongoing effort.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hope through redirection emerges from particulars like the steam repurposing and final equation, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "mapped stress fractures like poetry"); voice remains coherent under pressure, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold; figurative language (e.g., "bending entropy into architecture") is purposeful and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes civil engineering with decay in a fresh, non-obvious way; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
