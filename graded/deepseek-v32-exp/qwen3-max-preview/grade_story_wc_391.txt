<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The mapper's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in patience and transformation. Interiority is embodied through sensory details like the viaduct's hum, but internal contradictions are more thematic than dramatized in scene. The final endurance feels earned, with cost visible in the revolution's spread.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the revolution deepens into the environment, with cost legible in the old regime's retreat. The accumulative/textural lens holds strong, and orientation is anchored early by the frozen lake and viaduct.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the basalt sanctuary and frozen lake constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as the viaduct's iron bones gleaming after rain, integrating environment into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes center on transforming the viaduct through patient witnessing, escalating under the accumulative lens via density increases like the children's arrival and the regime's silence. Agency in mapping and unyoking drives the tension, with cost felt in the confusion and retreat of the old rulers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of patience over rage emerges organically through images like frost spreading and moon paths, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the revolution becoming "the air they breathed," reweighting prior stillness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects the mapper's purposeful grace. Voice modulates with pressure, such as in the restrained wildness of "translating gusts into glyphs," and elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences like "She sculpted patience from impatience" doing multiple jobs. Minor overwriting in peak beats, such as "restrained wildness humming under her skin," but no artifacts harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of revolution through patience and lunar tracking, transforming tropes with specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative narrative heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
