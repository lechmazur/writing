<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tutor's motivation is clear and intensifies through her interactions; her "patiently nimble" hands and micro-choices like folding origami reveal character under pressure. The final decision to descend to the basement is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the transition from lies to truth. Interiority is concrete and embodied, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she receives the key, reconfiguring her ability to communicate with the building under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is tight, from her curiosity to the archivist's revelations, with cost legible in the building's sigh of recognition. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "moss between flagstones" and "meteors streaked silently overhead" filtering through the tutor's POV. The rooftop garden and building itself constrain choices and charge the final image, as the building's sentience directly shapes the climax and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, from borrowing sugar to the key exchange, tightening the stake of understanding the building's language. Cost is unmistakable in the shift from agreed-upon lies to truth, foreclosing the scaffold of deception with visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the seal and key symbolizing communication and truth. Subtext operates in the lies and silences, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the building's recognition. No moralizing; complexity lingers in the reciprocal relationship with the sentient structure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to the tutor, with a distinct perceptual signature in her poetic observations. Voice modulates under pressure, and dialogue with the archivist carries subtext and advances plot. No head-hopping; purposeful elision in the lies is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet clear, with high information density and varied rhythm, e.g., "painting the sky with fleeting silver scars." No loops or scaffold issues; figurative language is coherent and supports peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates toward closure without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The premise is highly original, synthesizing the concept of sentient buildings with a character-driven arc. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the desk seal and borrowed sugar, with risk-taking in the poetic style heightening stakes. The closure feels inevitable in hindsight, and the element integration is seamless.</comment>
