<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Historian's emotionally rational trait is embodied through concrete micro-choices like tracing the script, and her resolve is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the final stride. Interiority avoids stock phrasing, showing contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in "crimson surrender" image; causal lens holds tightly from discovery to planned revelation. Orientation is anchored early, and persistent constraint of the lie shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (hidden compartment) and charges the final image (rosebush puddle); sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered, avoiding generic description. Environment actively pressures the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under causal lens, with cost unmistakable in her resolve to recapture public imagination. Dominant stake (truth vs. myth) tightens meaningfully through the letter's discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of noble lies emerges through particulars like family curations, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in imagery (e.g., rosebush surrender) and avoids thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice modulates with pressure (e.g., "curated silence"). No head-hopping, and elision (e.g., mentor's warning) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language (e.g., "veins of forgotten time") is coherent and purposeful. Closure image remains clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes historian trope with specific lived detail; risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry. Execution feels inevitable in hindsight, though premise is not entirely novel.</comment>
