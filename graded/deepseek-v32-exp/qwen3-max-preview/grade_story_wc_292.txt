<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices like transcribing the stanza despite alarms. Her "nervously confident" trait is shown through trembling fingers and steady voice, earning her closure through agency. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; internal conflict is dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages from journal discovery to weather control. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost: the jet stream shifts, reversing exile through her actions. Orientation is clear early; no plot amnesia or teleporting props.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the weather station pressuring choices and the copper nail constraining the final image. Sensory details like "flickering emergency lamps" and "rain rose from the earth" reflect POV bias. Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reversing exile) escalates through Elara's agency under causal lens, culminating in her questioning the storm. Cost is legible when the wind answers, forcing a trade-off. No coincidence; pressure tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory and grief emerges through events and images, not statement, with the storm as memory. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via "some maps aren’t drawn on paper." No moralizing; subtext in copper nail and stanzas.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature and poetic rhythm. Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., "Clouds unspooled backward." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "glaciers wept into steam." Read-aloud test passes; sentences advance story without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of weather control, coded stanzas, and reversible exile feels inevitable. Tropes transformed through specific details like the copper nail. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
