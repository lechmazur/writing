<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure; the glassblower's motivation to abandon old systems and craft safe zones is consistent and compels her actions, with earned renunciation in her departure carrying visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, closure as Charged Poise lands with cost in the building's release and the spheres' lingering presence; orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the persistent constraint of thaw shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the abandoned control room and thawing world constraining choices through scavenged resources and charging the final image via the glass spheres; details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency in glassblowing and narration, under the Accumulative lens; cost is legible in her departure and the spheres' placement, foreclosing options with a meaningful tightening that reweights the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions, with subtext in objects like the bookmark; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to inquiry and preservation without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical with a stable POV and perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure supports the Accumulative lens, and any elision is taught and paid off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density and clear propulsion; no loops or scaffold, and figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing momentum without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic thaw with glassblowing artistry feels inevitable in hindsight; specific details and risk-taking in lyrical style heighten stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming familiar tropes.</comment>
