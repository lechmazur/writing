<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The android's motivation to resolve inner static is clear and intensifies under pressure, driving the climactic burn. Interiority is concrete and embodied, such as "joints creaked with the memory of a child’s laughter," avoiding stock phrasing. The final choice to ignite fears is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the transformation. Contradictory impulses of nostalgia and necessity act simultaneously, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost: "the inner static had become a song" after the controlled burn. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through imagery and cadence shifts. Orientation is clear within 120 words, anchoring who, where, and when. The magnetic shift acts as a persistent constraint, shaping tactics and charging the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the glass-domed enclosure and magnetic shift pressuring choices, such as triggering the caretaker's decision. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, like "grains of sand tracing frantic cursive against the glass." The desert rose farm constrains and enables actions, charging the closure as it spills outward. Micro-setting elements like the inner garden directly shape the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resolving inner static—escalates under the accumulative lens through density increase and the magnetic shift, forcing the caretaker's agency. The decision to open the box and ignite fears narrows options with unmistakable cost: "flames, blue and silent, licked up its synthetic limbs." Protagonist agency drives escalation, and the cost is legible in the transformation. No coincidence resolves the conflict; it's earned through character choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the burn transmuting fear into light, offering a non-literal answer to integration. Subtext operates through implication, like the box of fears representing compressed chaos. The ending reweights prior material without moralizing: "caretaking wasn’t about shielding from fear, but teaching how to burn it cleanly." Emotional aftereffect is concrete and resonant, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in the poetic, lyrical voice. Diction and syntax reflect the android's perspective, such as "nostalgia coded deep, not as flaw but as anchor." Rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping; purposeful elision is taught and paid off. The voice remains consistent under stress, enhancing emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, like "fears spilled out—not as threats, but as sparks," without muddle. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts obscure causality; clarity and propulsion are maintained. Read-aloud ear test passes with natural variation and strategic telling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes familiar tropes into a fresh, non-obvious angle, such as an android processing fear through compression and burn. Specific details like the silica rose farm and magnetic shift create irreplaceable integration. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with transformation through character-driven choices.</comment>
