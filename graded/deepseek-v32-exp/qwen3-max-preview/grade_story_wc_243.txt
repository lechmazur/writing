Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The final renunciation of mourning in favor of witness forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an accumulative/textural lens; cost is felt in the acceptance of loss and commitment to memory. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The final image of walking home beneath a starring sky reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>
