<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The collector's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as kneeling beside dread and playing the flute. The final choice to harmonize is earned by prior causality, with cost in the "luminous ache." Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost ("luminous ache" and "fuller" steps), under an accumulative/textural lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the gorge's distortion shapes tactics persistently. No causality breaks or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated, with Echo Gorge's distorted notes guiding choices and charging the final image ("gilding every fissure"). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the collector's POV, and the environment constrains action meaningfully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, from listening to playing the flute, triggering confessions and laughter. Cost is legible in the tooth's pulsing and the collector's "fuller" state. Stakes are clear and tighten meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, with a resonant, non-literal answer to grief and healing in the integration of laughter. Subtext operates in gestures and implications, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and rhythmic control under pressure. Perceptual signature is character-specific, and purposeful compression (e.g., "luminous ache") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity and propulsion. Minor overwriting risks are outweighed by overall craft excellence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of soul collection and harmonic healing, with risk-taking in lyrical style that heightens stakes. Specific details (e.g., crocodile's tooth) feel organic and indispensable, transforming tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
