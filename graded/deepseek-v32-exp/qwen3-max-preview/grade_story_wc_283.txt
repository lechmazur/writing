<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's interiority is concrete and embodied; micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values, and final renunciation is earned with visible cost when she leaves jars at crossroads.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure lands with Conceptual Repricing as echo's clear speech reweights prophecy, with cost legible in her recognition and slowed hourglass turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (warehouse shelves, jars) and charges final image; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, e.g., "dust motes hung like suspended breath."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens; cost is unmistakable when echo speaks clearly, forcing a trade-off in her method and outreach.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, e.g., "prophecy wasn’t prediction—it was raw possibility."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; POV stable, voice lyrical and consistent, with purposeful compression, e.g., "sand falling not as time, but as truth shedding its skin."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high information density with clear propulsion; figurative language is coherent and supports peak beats without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar tropes through specific details; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, e.g., buttons as archaeology of choice.</comment>
