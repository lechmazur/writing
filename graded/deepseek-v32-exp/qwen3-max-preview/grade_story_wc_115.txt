<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as "flashlight trembling in her grip, not from fear but from drowsy alertness." Final choice to twist the wheel and accept the weight is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the shift from drowsy alertness to steadiness. Contradictory impulses act in scene, e.g., her skepticism versus her driven exploration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing as the protagonist redefines the ghost shift as her mind's machinery, with felt cost in "the weight hadn't vanished. But it had shifted." Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through layered memories and details. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and persistent constraint of guilt shapes tactics. No causality breaks; the radio reveal is earned and transformative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details like "tunnel exhaled a breath of mildew and rust" filtering through POV. The valve wheel and tunnel environment constrain choices and charge the final image, as the wheel's turning leads to her realization. Micro-setting elements are integrated into action, e.g., her kneeling to touch the wheel alters her stance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of internal conflict over guilt is signaled early and escalates through protagonist's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Key tightening occurs when she touches the valve wheel and hears the radio, narrowing options. Cost is legible in the dust falling "like silent applause" and her acceptance of the weight. No coincidence; resolution earned through her actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of guilt and memory emerges organically through events and images, such as the valve wheel spinning backward as "guilt rewinds time." Subtext operates in the radio broadcast and her realization. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, e.g., "The factory ghost shift was over. Hers had just begun." No thematic echo or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "drowsy alertness that clung to her like static after sleep." Voice is consistent under pressure, with rhythmic control and purposeful elision. Dialogue, though minimal in the radio broadcast, feels natural and advances plot. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences like "The tunnel exhaled a breath of mildew and rust, and her boots scuffed echoes that scurried ahead like rats" advancing multiple elements. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Closure image is clear and resonant, with no artifacts obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the psychological transformation of ghost story tropes, with a fresh angle on guilt and memory. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, e.g., the radio reveal tying back to her confession. Risk-taking in structure and tone heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific, non-obvious choices deepen character and theme.</comment>
