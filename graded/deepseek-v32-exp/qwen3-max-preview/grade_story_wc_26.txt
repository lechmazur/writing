<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion; her micro-choices under pressure, such as hunting the shadow with patience, lead to an earned final action that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens, with Elira's embedding of the river stone reweighting hope's meaning; cost is legible in the dream changes, and the lens holds without contradiction from early pattern-teaching.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The library above clouds and river stone constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, with the stone's pulse echoing forgotten earth, directly shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elira's agency under the accumulative lens, from discovering the shadow's metamorphosis to acting on it; cost is unmistakable in the altered dreams, and stakes tighten meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of hope's resilience emerges through events and images, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the shadow's adaptation, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice has a distinct perceptual signature with poetic rhythm and controlled diction; POV is stable and elision is taught early, with no head-hopping, sustaining pressure through consistent focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent and supports propulsion, with no muddle in peak beats like the metamorphosis realization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes fresh concepts like the shadow unbound and shareable dreams with specificity; risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes, and the premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
