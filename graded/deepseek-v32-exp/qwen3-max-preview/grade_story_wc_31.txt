<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to "hunt the color of sound" is clear and intensifies under pressure, driving his dive and revelation. Interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., "the key tag felt heavier than iron." Final choice to leave the ledger is earned by prior causality with visible cost in his transformed stance. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws like obsession complicate choices credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, with patterns of vows and keys building to a Conceptual Repricing closure where his discovery reweights truth and sound. Orientation is clear by ~120 words. Closure lands on-page with cost in his realization and the ledger's pulse; persistent constraint of the key tag shapes tactics. No causality breaks or teleporting props.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (e.g., "pages blooming like anemones") reflect POV bias and urgency. The sunken library constrains choice by necessitating the dive and charges the final image with the ledger's glow. Spatial choreography is coherent; micro-setting (key tag) alters tactics. No generic placeholder or momentum stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering sound's color escalates under accumulative lens through density increase in the dive and ledger revelation. Protagonist's agency drives tightening, e.g., diving without hesitation. Cost is legible in his gasping surfacing and redefined purpose. No coincidence or static conflict; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth hiding behind truth emerges through particulars like the key and vows, not direct statement. Subtext operates in gestures (vanished woman's whisper) and the final image of the ledger pulsing. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic echo or sermonizing; complexity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "silence spoke clearer after midnight"). Poetic, rhythmic prose modulates with pressure; diction is character-specific. No head-hopping or register drift; elision (e.g., woman's identity) is taught and paid off. Dialogue minimal but natural where present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical prose with high information density and varied syntax accelerates with scene needs. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language ("drowned stars reborn") is coherent and purposeful. Read-aloud rhythm is strong; no grammatical errors or clarity issues in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sound as color and luminous vows feels inevitable, transformed through specific details like the sunken ship and ledger. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry. No template plots or derivative premise; emotional truth and specificity anchor universals.</comment>
