<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The caretaker's motivation is clear and consistent, embodied through actions like whispering names and tending emptiness. Her micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final renunciation (preservation without restoration) is earned with visible cost. However, internal contradiction is minimal, which slightly limits depth for the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in "The light didn’t last. It never did." The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with patterns of echo and light building to a decisive change. Orientation is clear early, and the cracked chime shapes tactics persistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices, such as the library's architecture enabling wind for the chime. Sensory details (e.g., "dew from crystalline petals") are selective and purposeful. The cracked chime constrains choice and charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preservation without restoration) escalates under the accumulative lens through density increases in description and action. Agency is clear in the caretaker's whispering, leading to a cost (fleeting light) that reweights options. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of impermanent preservation emerges organically from images like the cracked chime and foxglove-hued light. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the caretaker's smile and the fading light, avoiding moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with a stable POV and perceptual signature (e.g., "lit her path by listening"). Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and purposeful compression (e.g., "foxglove regret-hued") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with no muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and clarity is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh, transforming tropes of memory preservation through specific elements like the cracked chime. Synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking in quiet, lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth anchors originality.</comment>
