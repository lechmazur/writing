<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to hush dissonance is clear and rooted in guilt; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "voice cracking like thawing ice"); final choice to tether the glyph is earned by prior causality and shows micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with cost as the firmware weeps and static dissolves; Accumulative lens holds with patterns building to a resonant reconfiguration; orientation is clear early, and persistent constraint of guilt shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the laboratory constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details are selective and reflect POV bias, such as "vacuum tubes throbbing with violet light."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, from writing the letter to using the amber; cost is legible in her use of blood and dust, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness emerges from events and images without direct statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the new constellation, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is poetic and consistent under pressure; no head-hopping or elision issues, with purposeful compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold issues; figurative language is consistent and enhances clarity, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is highly original with fresh synthesis of elements; risk-taking in style and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
