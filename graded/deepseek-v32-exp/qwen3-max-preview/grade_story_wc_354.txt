<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., tracing the worry stone, closing eyes to translate silence). The final choice to teach others is earned by prior causality, foreclosing solitude with visible cost in "hopeful melancholy." Contradictory impulses act in scene, balancing past precision with current revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing, reweighting exile into exploration with felt cost in the final image of the stone as a "compass calibrated to inner north." The accumulative/textural lens holds, with silence translation and magnetic pulses deepening stakes. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the covenant motif pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details (cold stone, humming, auroras) filtering through the tutor's POV. The magnetic nexus and worry stone constrain choices and charge the final image, altering tactics and resonance. Economy of detail supports atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, as correlation intensifies through magnetic surges and internal realizations. Cost is legible in the acceptance of exile and transformation of anxiety. Dominant stake (beauty in difficulty) tightens meaningfully without external antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (worry stone, covenant, correlation), with subtext in silence and gesture. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "beauty blooms brightest in the soil of difficulty," avoiding moralizing. Epiphanies are earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature that reflects the tutor's mindset. Rhythm and syntax modulate with emotional pressure, and purposeful compression (e.g., "translating silence") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Minor overwriting in dense figurative language (e.g., "structured quiet between heartbeats") does not obscure closure. Read-aloud flow is strong, with clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of chess, exile, and cosmic elements feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details (worry stone, magnetic nexus). Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
