<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., tracing postcards, kneeling to examine glass) reveal character. The final understanding and continued work feel earned with visible cost in her emotional response and purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (understanding beauty in obscurity) and felt cost (weeping from realization). Inferred accumulative/textural lens holds; orientation is clear early, and causality is tight from postcard anomaly to cathedral discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful (amber pavilion, cathedral), with sensory details integrated into action. The cathedral window constrains choice and charges the final image, as her discovery hinges on its hidden layers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding night-blooming flowers) escalates through protagonist's agency in uncovering hidden glass layers. Cost is legible in her emotional breakthrough and continued work, under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events (encoded flowers, mural), offering a resonant, non-literal answer about beauty in darkness. Subtext operates in implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature; lyrical prose reflects character's mindset. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., journey compression) is taught and pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops or scaffold issues; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific (decoding botanical symbols in glass), transforming tropes through grounded details. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
