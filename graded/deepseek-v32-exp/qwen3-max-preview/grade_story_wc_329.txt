<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (aching arm, blistered fingers). Micro-choices under pressure reveal values, and final endurance is earned with visible cost. Minor hairline slip in limited internal conflict, but closure choice is motivated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost (locust shell dust, physical effort). Causality is coherent from music to transformation. Orientation is clear early, and pattern pays off at closure without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and selective, woven into action. Setting constrains choices (statues' patrols) and charges the final image (orchard exhaling, apples blushing). Environment functions as micro-setting, altering tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawakening beauty vs. mechanical silence) escalates through protagonist agency (playing music, using locust shell). Cost is legible on-page (physical strain, shell spent). One meaningful tightening under accumulative lens deepens stakes without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images (locust shell as metamorphosis, music as resonance), not statement. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature. Voice is poetic and rhythmic, modulating with pressure. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off. Minor register consistency in peak beats, but clarity maintained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs. No artifacts obscuring closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh, specific details (violinist, locust shell, living statues). Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation feels inevitable in hindsight, and closure commits fully to premise.</comment>
