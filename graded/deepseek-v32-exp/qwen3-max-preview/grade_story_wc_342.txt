<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's face blindness is deeply integrated with her actions and epiphany; micro-choices under pressure (e.g., tracing coin indentations) reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final realization that her limit is a lens is earned through prior causality with visible cost (impending demolition).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she smiles at dawn, reconfiguring her perception of blindness with cost felt through the transient art; Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, and time pressure shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tree trunk library setting constrains choices (demolition deadline) and charges the final image; sensory details (e.g., "bark-worn shelves," "cloud-shadows pooled on bark") are selective, purposeful, and filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving celestial wonder) escalates under Accumulative lens via time pressure and her agency in painting; cost is legible in the art's imminent destruction and her communion with the guild's intent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of perception vs. essence emerges through particulars (coin mapping, face blindness) without moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via her smile and realization, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature (tactile focus); voice is poetic yet controlled under pressure, and any elision (e.g., sparse dialogue) is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety (e.g., "whisper of bristles on wood"); zero loops or scaffold issues; figurative language is coherent and heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes face blindness and celestial cartography with inevitability; risk-taking in lyric style and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels organic to the specific synthesis.</comment>
