<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies, rooted in traits of seeking absences; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "trembling, lungs empty, heart full"); final choice to play the invisible symphony is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the transformed silence. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost as silence hums alive; Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern buildup of water, light, and music; orientation is clear early; ghost's appearance and wordless conversation arise from established pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (wading, angling lantern) and charges the final image (water vibrating, swirling); sensory details are vivid and selective (e.g., "lantern light trembling," "water pooled in its creases"); spatial choreography is coherent with no generic elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens (e.g., angling lantern, mirroring gestures); cost is legible in the emotional resolution and changed silence; dominant stake of unraveling the code tightens through her actions, foreclosing prior stillness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of absences and silence emerges through events and images, not statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer as "the in between spaces finally sang"; subtext operates in wordless conversation and water imagery, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "listening with skin, with memory"); rhythmic control under pressure (e.g., "swirling in eddies that matched the tempo"); no head-hopping; purposeful elision (e.g., ghost's speech in gestures) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "water pooled in its creases, magnifying the stains into shimmering glyphs"); no artifacts obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of ghost story and musical decay, feeling inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in wordless resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry; specifics like water-damaged music and flooded setting avoid template plots.</comment>
