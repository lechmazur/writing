<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation as historian of small gestures is clear and rooted in their crisis actor past, with interiority shown through concrete actions like walking patterns and documenting gestures. Micro-choices under pressure, such as not bowing to the new sovereign, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final choice to spell "listen" is earned by prior causality, foreclosing paths with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive lens holds throughout, with closure as a conceptual repricing where the protagonist's walk redefines power dynamics, costing the sovereign's comfort. Orientation is clear early, and the mosaic structure of shards (gallery walks, survivor arrivals) coheres under the lens, with a decisive change in perception at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Whispering gallery setting constrains choices by enabling the walking patterns and echoing silences, charging the final image with the pawnless chessboard and penumbra. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like the domed ceiling's echoes, filtered through the protagonist's POV to mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of meaning in the interregnum escalates under the accumulative lens through protagonist agency, as walking spells attract survivors and unbind vows, culminating in the sovereign's trembling. Cost is legible in the dissolution of chains and the terror of being seen, with a meaningful tightening that reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of absence and small gestures emerges through particulars like the pawnless chessboard and unbinding actions, with subtext in gestures like the widow's ring placement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the luminous absence image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic diction and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful elision, like the spelled words, is taught early and pays off at closure, with no head-hopping and consistent voice modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold issues; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, as in "silences shaped like breaths." No artifacts obscure causality or closure, and sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of crisis actor, interregnum, and historian concepts feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in accumulative structure and imagery heightening stakes. Specific details like the pawnless chessboard transform tropes through grounded choices, offering a fresh angle on power and memory.</comment>
