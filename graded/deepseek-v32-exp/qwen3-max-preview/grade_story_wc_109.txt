<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The oracle's obsession with absence is consistently portrayed through embodied micro-choices, such as tracing pages and whispering summaries, culminating in an earned renunciation as she enters the mapped night. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with emotions filtered through tactile details like "calloused fingers" and "salt-stiffened shawl." The final choice feels inevitable due to prior causality, with visible cost in her descent into darkness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she enters the territory she charted, with cost legible in the "marbled hush" welcoming her. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building density through summarized silences. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the single-scene structure tightens coherently toward the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the finale, with the ridge fort's "cold, salt-crusted stone" and "ambered hush" shaping her actions. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, reflecting POV bias—e.g., thunder as a "muted heartbeat." The storm-tossed environment actively pressures her solitude, altering tactics and deepening the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, as her summarizing silence intensifies stakes toward the map's completion. Cost is unmistakable in her departure, foreclosing other paths. The dominant stake (mapping the night) tightens through her whispered coordinates, with no coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like "unsung pauses between heartbeats," offering a non-literal answer to absence through the final image of the "labyrinth of quiet." Subtext operates in gestures and implications, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material with conceptual cost, inviting reflection without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature—e.g., "silence not empty, but dense with memory." Voice is poetically controlled under pressure, with rhythmic syntax that accelerates and breathes with scene needs. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., "listening sideways") is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("like honeyed resin trapping ancient breath") is consistent and purposeful, never muddling peak beats. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, supporting momentum without artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The concept of mapping silence is a non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric style heightening stakes without gimmickry. Specific details (e.g., "drowned cartographer") anchor freshness, and the core premise integrates fully with character and closure. Authenticity of vision is unwavering.</comment>
