<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interior contradiction and micro-choices under pressure are vividly embodied; his shift from revolutionary to translator is earned with visible cost in the weeping scene. Motivation intensifies through collaboration, and flaws complicate choices without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong; closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the final haiku and realization. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraint (mirrors) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is integral, with the baroque asteroid and time streams constraining choices (e.g., covering mirrors) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is agency-driven under accumulative lens, with stakes tightening through the mirror method and collaboration; cost is legible in the protagonist's weeping and the reconfiguration of purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in silences and gestures; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the haiku and translation concept without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic diction and rhythmic control under pressure; dialogue natural and goal-driven when present, and elision (e.g., time streams) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats, and propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ideas (visible time, archaeological dispute) feels inevitable; risk-taking in style and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and transformation through specific detail is evident.</comment>
