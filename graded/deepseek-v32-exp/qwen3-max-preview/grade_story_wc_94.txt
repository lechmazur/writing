<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority; the poet's "furiously tranquil" state and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., not opening the envelope) reveal contradictory impulses. Motivation to understand "cartography of scars" compels higher-stakes choices, and the final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as she honors the question without opening the envelope, with cost legible in "the silence was enough." Orientation is clear early, and the vigil concept shapes structure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory (e.g., "stormlit observatory," "lightning streaked dome"), constraining choice by mirroring her inward gaze. The darkroom timer and envelope recur to charge the final image, meeting the 9+ test for environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict over censorship and scars) escalates under accumulative lens through ritualized actions; agency in renunciation (not opening the envelope) forecloses a path with cost ("silence was enough"). One meaningful tightening occurs as the timer clicks zero, driven by protagonist choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events (e.g., envelope as "secret treaty," scars as "coordinates"), with subtext in silence and storm. Ending offers a non-literal, resonant answer through her becoming "her own atlas," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; poetic diction and rhythmic control ("ticking was a metronome to memory") heighten pressure without head-hopping. Purposeful elision (e.g., not opening the envelope) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, but slight overwriting in peaks (e.g., "oracle of ink and bone") causes minor figurative strain. No loops or scaffolds; rhythm and syntax propel the accumulative drive clearly, though not flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of censorship, cartography, and vigil; specific details (bus timetable, darkroom timer) transform tropes. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
