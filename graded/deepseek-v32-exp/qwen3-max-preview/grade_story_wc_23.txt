<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The navigator's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., waiting for moon phases after static incident). Her final endurance and build action are earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the closure. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; internal conflict is dramatized through physiological ties to lunar cycles.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the flickers answering her song, under an accumulative/textural lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear early (who, where, when), and the reverse migration concept shapes tactics without causality breaks. The persistent constraint of moon phases charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details filtered through POV (e.g., rusted gantry, censer foot's ghost-heat). The station and censer foot constrain choices and charge the closure, acting as micro-settings that pressure navigation. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve with the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigating loss) escalates through protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with one meaningful tightening when she whispers coordinates and receives a reply. Cost is legible in the static incident and the effort of building lattices. Pressure coheres until the final image reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images (e.g., reverse migration, resonance), without direct statement or moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to loss through the flickers, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates with emotional intensity (e.g., "dial tone becomes a dirge"), and purposeful elision (cryptic calls) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction remains within the navigator's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "moon phases that tune her bones"). Closure image is sharp, and read-aloud rhythm supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, synthesizing reverse migration, lunar physiology, and cryptic communication into a non-obvious whole. Risk-taking in structure and style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Details are particular and transformative, with the closure feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
