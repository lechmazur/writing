<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and obsessive, driving all choices. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as her heart quieting at the climax. The final reclamation feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her decades-long search. Contradictory impulses are less emphasized, but her singular focus is consistent and compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, building through descriptive layers to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page with cost as the dream becomes present, fulfilling her longing. Orientation is clear early, and the structure is taut with one meaningful tightening. The final image of "luminous absence—filled" charges the ending with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with the archipelago and palette constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "salt-damp sand" and "dawn's first blush" are purposeful and filtered through POV. The environment actively shapes tactics, such as using the jetty for light capture, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of capturing the dream escalates under accumulative lens through density of attempts and theoretical components. Agency is clear in her active pursuit and final application of light. Cost is legible in the blend of loss and surrender, foreclosing other paths. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of longing as a map emerges implicitly through events and images, not statement. Subtext operates in light-capturing and the dream's return. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality, anchored in concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct, poetic perceptual signature. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, such as the quiet rhythm at the climax. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without scaffolding. Figurative language like "liquid memory" is purposeful and coherent. No loops or artifacts; sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative build. Read-aloud test passes with natural cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, synthesizing dream-preservation and light-painting into a organic, specific vision. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight, with no derivative echoes.</comment>
