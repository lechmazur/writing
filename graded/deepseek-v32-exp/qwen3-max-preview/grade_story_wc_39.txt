<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation evolves credibly from survival to redemption, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., repairing music box with sounds, leaving anonymous jars). Interiority is concrete and embodied, avoiding stock phrasing. Final renunciation of recognition is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the poet's disappearance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the poet's departure and lingering jars, reconfiguring meaning of continuity. Cost is legible in the final poem and anonymous gifts. Orientation is clear early, and pattern taught through sound-capturing builds coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices (e.g., loft stores jars, dunes inspire sounds). Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered, charging the final image. The feral loft and music box recur with reweighted meaning, supporting atmosphere and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal survival to communal redemption under Accumulative lens, driven by poet's agency in capturing and gifting sounds. Cost is visible in his anonymity and the emotional impact on townsfolk. One meaningful tightening occurs when he shifts to leaving jars unclaimed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of gleaned redemption emerges organically from particulars (jars, music box repair), with subtext in gestures and images. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final poem and lingering jars, avoiding moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and lingering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, modulating with emotional intensity. Purposeful compression (e.g., sound descriptions) is taught and pays off. No head-hopping; dialogue, when present, is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative build, and closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Concept of sound-bottling and music box repair is fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific details (e.g., jars as reliquaries). Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure is legible.</comment>
