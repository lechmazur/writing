<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Characterization is deep and consistent; the mystic's motivation to prove objects absorb emotions is clear and drives the narrative. Her micro-choices, like sketching in the notebook, reveal her values under pressure. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with no stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot under the Accumulative/Textural lens coheres, with closure as a Conceptual Repricing—the frost melting from release reweights the premise with cost. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The decisive change in the mystic's realization ("Proof was not in replication, but in resonance") lands with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful; the quartz arbor and prism constrain choice and charge the final image, amplifying the communion. Sensory details (e.g., "mist curling like breath") are selective and filtered through POV, avoiding cliché. The environment actively shapes tactics and outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the Accumulative lens through the mystic's agency in communing, leading to a revelation that narrows options. The cost is legible in the frost's release and her decision not to publish. One meaningful tightening deepens the dominant stake without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through "Emotion is mass. Memory is gravity." Subtext operates in gesture and implication, avoiding moralizing. The conceptual repricing reweights prior material without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and stable in single POV, with a poetic perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is taught and paid off at closure. The narrative stance remains consistent and effective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, and diction is purposefully elevated without violating POV lexicon. Closure image remains sharp and undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality is high with a fresh premise of communing with emotions in objects, executed through specific details and a non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight and transforms familiar ideas.</comment>
