<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elira's sympathetic skepticism is consistently embodied, with internal conflict between doubt and wonder driving her actions. Her motivation to sculpt space for reflection is clear and compels higher-stakes choices, such as transcribing feelings instead of solving the mystery. The final renunciation (leaving the score for others) is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in Elira's acceptance of harmony over solution. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, building through emotional harmonics and pattern density. Orientation is anchored early, and the tile's constraint shapes the final image decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the tower, whales, and stars creating a cohesive atmosphere. The magic tile as a micro-setting constrains choice and charges the final image, influencing Elira's transcription and the story's closure. Details are purposefully integrated into action and reflection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (seeking harmony) escalate under the accumulative lens through Elira's agency with the tile, leading to a cadence shift in her understanding. Cost is legible in her decision to transcribe and leave the score, foreclosing personal resolution for communal reflection. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from particulars—memory, connection, and wonder—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the score as an "unheard symphony," reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures and silences, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature that reflects Elira's skepticism and wonder. Voice modulates under pressure, and purposeful compression (e.g., "transcribing feeling") is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purpose-driven, even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, supporting the accumulative texture without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of skeptic, magic tile, and entangled memories, transformed through specific, grounded choices. The core premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in the lyric structure heightening stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth avoids template plots.</comment>
