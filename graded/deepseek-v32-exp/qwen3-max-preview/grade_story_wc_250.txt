<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The guardian's motivation is deeply rooted and consistent, with interiority shown through concrete actions like tracing wood grain and using the mirror. Her silent empathy drives higher-stakes choices, such as weaving light for the drowned woman, and her final renunciation is earned with visible cost in the woman's transformation. The character's flawed, enduring nature is embodied without stock phrasing, making her choices compelling under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost when the drowned woman smiles and sinks gently, reconfiguring meaning under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The structure is taut, with clear orientation by ~120 words and no causality breaks. The persistent constraint of the canal's hunger shapes tactics, and the final star image charges the closure with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the cobalt dock and shutters constraining choices and charging the final image—e.g., the iron grates sculpt light glyphs that directly alter the drowned woman's fate. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the guardian's POV, and the environment evolves causally with events, avoiding static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as the guardian's weaving intensifies to confront the drowned woman, narrowing options with cost legible in the touch and smile. The dominant stake of guiding lost souls tightens meaningfully, and the resolution forecloses paths through the guardian's actions, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions, such as the mirror capturing "fragments of light no eye should witness," offering a resonant, non-literal answer to teaching darkness without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and gesture, and the final star piercing the clouds reweights prior material with complexity and ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects the guardian's calm intensity—e.g., "silence was her dialect." Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in shutter-click sequences, and any elision (like the boy's memory) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with figurative language like "drowned sapphire" serving pattern and closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts; sentence-level rhythm accelerates with the weaving action. Minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "hope's geometry") doesn't obscure causality, but prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of silent empathy, light-weaving, and canal mythology feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric style heightening stakes without gimmickry. Specific details like the dental mirror's stolen origin transform tropes, and the closure reconfigures concepts with bold, singular vision.</comment>
