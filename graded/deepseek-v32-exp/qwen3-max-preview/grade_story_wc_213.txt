<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's patience and credibly curious nature are embodied through micro-choices like smiling at the rope's tremble, earning the final trust restoration with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and consistent, avoiding stock phrasing. No significant weaknesses in characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly; orientation is clear within 120 words. Closure lands with cost in the bell's toll restoring trust, and the calibrated triggers shape tactics. No causality breaks or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image—the bell rope and sanctuary pressure the protagonist's actions. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like the "wind-polished stone dust" and "swollen journal."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in the transition from false alarms to trust. Stakes are clear early and tighten through the wait for the storm, though no external antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of listening over noise emerges through particulars like the calibrated triggers and the bell's resonant toll, offering a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext is rich in imagery, such as the rope as a "dormant serpent."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "spire a needle stitching heaven." Lyrical prose is consistent and voice-motivated, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language, like "prayer caught mid-breath," is coherent and serves momentum. Minor overwriting in peaks but clarity untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of the tester role with microclimate tracking feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical heightens stakes. Specific details, like the dew-point triggers, avoid derivativeness and support closure.</comment>
