<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and intensifies through discovery, with embodied emotion like "mossy delight." Micro-choices under pressure, such as prodding the speck, reveal hierarchy of values. The transformation is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in her weeping and moss blooming.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the arbor harmonizes past memories, cost legible in Elira's tears causing moss growth. Accumulative/textural lens held throughout, with orientation clear early. No causality breaks; the prophecy's reinterpretation as perpetually unfolding past is decisive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices: the arbor's leaves and moonstone specks directly influence Elira's actions and charge the final image. Sensory details like "petrichor and starlight" are purposeful and integrated into action. Micro-setting (speck) alters tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding messages escalates through agency-driven discoveries, like prodding the speck, under accumulative lens. Cost is legible in emotional resonances and transformation. One meaningful tightening deepens the stake, foreclosing prior paths without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory and past emerges through particulars like monuments and specks, not statement. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer with the past harmonizing. Subtext operates in gestures and imagery, avoiding moralizing. Earned through concrete experience and struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic and consistent, modulating with emotional pressure. Minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and supports closure without muddle. Minor overwriting is purposeful and does not harm clarity at peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers fresh synthesis of mystical arboreal communication and memory, transformed through specific details like moonstone specks. Emotional truth and risk-taking in lyrical style heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Inevitable in hindsight with bold choices.</comment>
