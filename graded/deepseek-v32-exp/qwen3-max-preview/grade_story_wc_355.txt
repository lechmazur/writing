<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her pacifist archivist role, with embodied micro-choices under pressure, such as adjusting frequencies intuitively. Her final reverence feels earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure lands with resonant reconfiguration as the clasp opens and silences are preserved, costing the fireworks' chaos. Orientation is immediate, and causality is tight from frequency attempts to success.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice, with the workshop's tools and clasp charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven through action without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes of recovering silence before fireworks escalate through Elara's agency in tuning frequencies, with cost legible in the clasp's surrender and her reverence. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of empathy through silence emerges organically from concrete actions and images, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., frequency mechanics) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold obscuring closure. Minor overwriting in figurative language doesn't harm clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept is highly original, synthesizing silence as empathy with specific, irreplaceable details. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
