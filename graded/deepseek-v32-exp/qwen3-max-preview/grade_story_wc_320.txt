<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with concrete interiority and micro-choices that reveal character. The final understanding—finding the beginning in endings—is earned through prior causality, though internal conflict is minimal but sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as the city awakens, under an accumulative lens; cost is felt in the transformation, and orientation is clear early. The lunar perigee and tuning method shape tactics persistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the radio tower city and gorge pressuring choices and charging the final image. Micro-setting elements like the fragment and gloves constrain actions and enhance atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the accumulative lens through the protagonist's agency in tuning and discarding assumptions, with cost legible in the city's awakening. One meaningful tightening deepens the dominant stake of finding silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and imagery, offering a non-literal answer on beginnings and endings without moralizing. Subtext in the fragment's role and the final broadcast enriches resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is poetic and consistent, elision is taught and paid off in closure. No head-hopping or register issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats like the tuning sequence. No artifacts harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of cosmic and Hollywood elements, with specific details and risk-taking in lyrical style. The premise feels inevitable and transformative, heightening stakes.</comment>
