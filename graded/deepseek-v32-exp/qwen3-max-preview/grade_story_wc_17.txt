<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in trait; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "trembling fingers"). Micro-choices under pressure, like kneeling to listen, reveal values. Final choice to leave sketch is earned, foreclosing a path with visible cost ("heart heavier").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is Charged Poise with cost legible in "satchel lighter, her heart heavier." Orientation is clear early; persistent constraint of walls' memories shapes tactics. No causality breaks; closure reconfigures meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details (e.g., "whisper of leaves," "cold flagstone") filtered through POV. Ivy-veiled passage and fireplace constrain choices and charge the final image ("passage exhaling"). Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering what walls dream) escalates through protagonist's agency in finding and reading diaries. Cost is unmistakable in emotional weight during reading. Under Accumulative lens, density increase reweights stakes with no coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of legacy's burden emerges from particulars like diaries and sketching echoes. Subtext operates in gesture and image; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Final image reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and lyrical rhythm. Voice is consistent under pressure; purposeful compression is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent; no overwriting in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports accumulation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, transforming tropes through grounded details. Emotional truth and risk-taking in lyrical style heighten stakes. Synthesis feels inevitable, with originality in echo cartography concept.</comment>
