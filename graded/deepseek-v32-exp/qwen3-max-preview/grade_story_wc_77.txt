<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to unbosom fear is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotions like "fingers clawing at my shirt" revealing character under stress; final change is earned through causality with visible cost when extracting memories.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost ("no longer cursed, no longer hunted"); inferred Hybrid lens holds with causal progression from inciting incident to climax; orientation is anchored early in the funhouse setting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image—funhouse mirrors reflect dread, and the opera clasp pulses with fear; sensory details like "mildew and ghost of cotton candy" are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of overcoming fear escalates through protagonist's agency under Hybrid lens; key turn via dream dictionary reading and unbosoming narrows options with cost legible in memory extraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through imagery and action, not statement; ending offers resonant non-literal answer—fear as a reflection—reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled under pressure, e.g., "lingering luminance" as character-specific idiom; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "kaleidoscopic fractures" is purposeful and clear in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fear confrontation in a funhouse with a whispering advisor; specific details like melted carousel horses feel inevitable; risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
