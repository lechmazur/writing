<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "ink-stained fingers trembling at 3 a.m."). Contradictory impulses (jealousy vs. acceptance) act in scene, and the final endurance is earned with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) where the chaos gains shape, with cost legible in "the grave is smaller now." Orientation is clear early, and pattern of memory shards is taught and pays off. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful (cabin "breaths with old timber sighs"), and the birch bark scroll as micro-setting constrains choices (repels then accepts ink) and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict with memory) escalates under accumulative lens through protagonist's agency (hunting past selves), with cost unmistakable in the scroll's transformation. One meaningful tightening forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory and identity emerges through particulars (e.g., encounters with past selves), not statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("chaos has a shape"). No moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and rhythmic under pressure. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (memory flashes) is taught and paid off. Dialogue not present, but internal monologue is strong.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story efficiently, even in peak beats (e.g., "I soar again... hunting"). Minor overwriting in dense imagery but clarity intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of dream chronicling and self-confrontation feels inevitable; risk-taking in non-linear structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details (birch bark scroll, feral nostalgia) avoid template plots.</comment>
