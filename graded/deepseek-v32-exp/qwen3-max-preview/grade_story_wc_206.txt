<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Repairman's interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (trembling hands); guilt from past lie drives contradictory impulses, and final choice to sing is earned by stone's reaction, foreclosing deception with cost. Micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal/accumulative) holds; closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (dancer's movement reclaims light) with felt cost (weeping from wonder). Orientation clear early; causality tight from stone's wilting to song's success.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Resonance chamber constrains choice by enabling sympathetic vibration; sensory details (chiming glass, humming pipes) are selective and purposeful, charging final image. Micro-setting (music box) evolves with plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (reclaiming light) escalate under hybrid lens via protagonist agency (singing to remind); cost legible in emotional shift and shadows unmade. One meaningful tightening from stone's wilting to dancer's turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (truth through decay) emerges from particulars (covenant of rust, mending forgotten things); ending offers non-literal answer via dancer's motion, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single PVO stable with distinct perceptual signature (poetic, rhythmic prose); elision (past lie) taught and paid off in closure. No head-hopping; voice modulates with pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("truth blooming only when surfaces surrendered") is coherent and purposeful, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of magical realism and redemption arc; covenant of rust concept transforms tropes through specific detail. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
