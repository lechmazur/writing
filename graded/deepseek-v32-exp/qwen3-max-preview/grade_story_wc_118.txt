<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The historian's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., probing the fireplace) revealing embodied emotion. However, interior contradiction is minimal, and the final choice, while earned, lacks visible cost on the page, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise as she decides to descend and weave, reconfiguring options with cost legible in "the world might remember how to stand upright again." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with patterns building to a resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the silo library and tapestry constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, such as the "brittle ghosts of civilization" mirroring internal stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens, as discoveries narrow options and deepen knowledge, with cost felt in her decision to mend the axis. However, the stakes remain somewhat abstract, lacking a visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events, with the ending offering a non-literal answer to memory and meaning without moralizing. The tapestry and diaries create subtext, but the concept of "displaced axis" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and perceptive, with stable POV and rhythmic control, as seen in "silence grew teeth." No head-hopping or elision issues, though the poetic register risks overshadowing character specificity in peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax, but occasional figurative stacking (e.g., "ash still clung like regret") slightly muddles clarity without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of post-apocalyptic memory preservation with existential mending, transforming tropes through specific details like dragons as weavers. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
