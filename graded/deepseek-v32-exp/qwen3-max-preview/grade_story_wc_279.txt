<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotions like "lilac unease." Micro-choices in altering the mandala reveal values, and the final renunciation of fixing in favor of witnessing is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the tile flake cracking.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a conceptual repricing where the final image of rain traces reweights meaning with cost legible in the spent tile flake. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the emergent hush pattern pays off at closure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grotto setting constrains choices and charges the final image through sensory details like "damp sand" and "mist," actively shaping the protagonist's tactics. The environment functions as a micro-setting that alters options, with the mandala and whispers directly tied to the location's properties.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, as her interjection in the mandala synchronizes whispers, deepening stakes. Cost is unmistakable in the tile flake fracture and her transformed perception, foreclosing her prior path with visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the sand mandala and whispers, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to meaning without moralizing. Subtext operates through imagery and implication, such as the "unlearning" framing, and the ending reweights prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and controlled under pressure, e.g., "mist curled like breath." No head-hopping; purposeful elision in the grotto's phenomena is taught early and pays off at closure with clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variation without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "whispers synchronized" serves pressure and closure. No artifacts obscure causality, and sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, though some density may border overwriting without harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elements like emergent hush and sand mandala feels inevitable in hindsight, transforming familiar concepts through specific detail. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure effect remains legible and coherent.</comment>
