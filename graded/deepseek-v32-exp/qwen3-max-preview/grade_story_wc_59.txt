<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prince's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as "hollow-eyed and humming lullabies to cold metal." Micro-choices reveal values, and final endurance is earned with visible cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost as "beauty had stirred" and the egg's pulse reweights the world. Orientation is clear early, and causality is intact with no breaks. Cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the suspended palace and mechanical wasteland constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, like "steam-whistle shrieks" and "mineral tears." Environment shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early; escalation under accumulative lens through prince's agency, culminating in activation with cost legible as beauty stirs but egg hasn't hatched. Pressure coheres and deepens, though no major reversal, fitting the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of beauty vs. machinery emerges through events and images, not statement; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer with "beauty had stirred." Subtext in egg's symbolism and prince's struggle avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, reflecting prince's mindset. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, such as in hypothesizing, and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush and rhythmic with high information density, but minor overwriting in dense figurative language does not obscure clarity. No loops or artifacts; syntax varies naturally, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise is fresh synthesis of familiar tropes, transformed through specific details like the egg and mechanical world. Emotional truth is strong; risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
