<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Traveler's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion in tracing the thread and writing obituaries. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final act of mapping is earned with visible cost in solitude. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; characterization is consistent and deeply particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as the traveler folds the parchment, with cost legible in the 'lonesome splendor' and the thread's pulse. Accumulative lens holds throughout, with orientation anchored early in the garden. Persistent constraint of the thread shapes tactics and the final image, ensuring coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly described with selective sensory details (damp stone, falling leaves) that reflect the traveler's POV and charge the final image. The garden constrains choice by providing a quiet space for reflection, and micro-setting elements like the thread and rosebush alter tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake in understanding the geography of healing escalates through the traveler's agency in writing, deepening the map of absence. Under the accumulative lens, density increases with each obituary, foreclosing paths with felt cost in solitude. Cost is legible on the page in the final folding and leaving of the parchment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of absence and memory emerges through events and images like the thread and obituaries, not direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting prior material—mapping absence makes the gone present—without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person with distinct perceptual signature and poetic rhythm; voice modulates with emotional intensity without head-hopping. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue present, but internal voice is coherent and specific under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density with varied syntax and rhythmic control; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, accelerating with scene needs. Read-aloud test passes with natural momentum and clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original concept of writing obituaries for the living is fresh and transformed through specific details like the thread and Elira's story. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in lyrical style heightening stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth and specificity avoid generic templates.</comment>
