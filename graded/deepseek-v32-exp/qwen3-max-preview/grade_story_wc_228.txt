<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion (e.g., "hands trembling") and micro-choices (turning left) that reveal hierarchy of values. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. Final renunciation (leaving the shell) is earned by prior causality with visible cost, though minor lack of overt contradiction in impulses keeps it from highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost on-page ("something inside her had shifted"), under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The persistent constraint of the cave and shell shapes tactics and final image, with cost legible in the abandonment of the shell.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (e.g., "salt crystals glittered like frozen stars"), filtered through POV bias. The coastal cave network constrains choice and charges the final image, acting as a micro-setting that alters tactics. Economy and selectivity reinforce tone without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with a meaningful deepening as painting reweights the dominant stake of self-reconnection. Cost is legible in the physical and emotional toll ("fingers ached," leaving the shell). One tightening is sufficient, though it lacks multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images (mirror, shell, cave) without direct statement, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of reflection in motion. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, avoiding moralizing. The final image reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature reflected in rhythmic control and selective attention (e.g., "drips that sounded like metronomes"). Voice remains coherent under pressure, and any elision (e.g., compressed time) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with no muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative design, though minor poetic density prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the specific synthesis of familiar elements (personal renewal) through grounded choices in character and setting, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the core premise is transformed through lived detail.</comment>
