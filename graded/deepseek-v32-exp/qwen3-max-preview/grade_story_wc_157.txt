<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rogue scholar's motivation is clear and rooted in backstory (father fined for dreaming in Basque); micro-choices under pressure (planting seed, leaving beetle) reveal defiance and hierarchy of values. Dr. Vex's hesitation is earned by the lullaby connection, showing internal conflict. No stock phrasing; emotions embodied in actions like humming dead syntax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the garden symbolizing spreading resistance; cost is legible in the risk of defiance and Bureau's oversight. Hybrid lens (causal-accumulative) holds from scholar's actions to collective movement. Orientation is clear within 120 words; causality tight with Dr. Vex's support altering options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Greenhouse setting pressures choices (humidity dials, surveillance moths) and supplies resources; sensory details (damp moss, pinned wings) are selective and POV-filtered. Micro-setting (gourd seed) constrains tactics and charges the final image of the garden. Spatial choreography is coherent with clear navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes of resistance escalate from individual act to collective movement under Hybrid lens; scholar's agency (planting, warping plots) drives tightening, with cost in defiance against Bureau. Dr. Vex's support adds secondary pressure; closure reweights options with visible cost in the growing rebellion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of linguistic resistance emerges through concrete events and images (gourd rattle, vine patterns); subtext operates in gestures (beetle glyph, temple tap). No moralizing; ending reweights prior material with "garden" metaphor, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature (noticing chitin, syntax). Prose rhythm modulates with pressure; dialogue minimal but goal-driven (Dr. Vex's tap). No head-hopping; purposeful compression in lyric mode is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical but clear with high information density; no repetitive patterns, loops, or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated; sentences vary in structure, advancing story with propulsion. Minor overwriting in peaks but no muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original premise of taxable thoughts and secret language club offers fresh synthesis; tropes transformed through specific details (gourd rattle, community gardens). Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure feels inevitable from established pattern.</comment>
