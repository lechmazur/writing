<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zeta's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by curiosity and embodied in micro-choices under pressure, such as humming tones despite cracking voice. The final choice to trigger resonance is earned with visible cost (slumping in exhaustion), though internal conflict is minimal, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in Zeta's exhaustion and the bell's whisper, under a causal lens where her actions directly lead to the outcome. Orientation is immediate, and the structure tightens through because/therefore linkages, such as using the arrow tip to feed the algorithm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the acid sea and workshop constraining choices (e.g., acid threatening the hull) and charging the final image through tactile details like "brass-plated wings dripping green mist." Sensory selection reflects Zeta's professional focus, integrating seamlessly with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the causal lens through Zeta's agency, as she presses on against environmental pressure (acid waves, shrieking gears) to achieve transliteration, with cost unmistakable in her vocal strain and slumped posture. One meaningful tightening forecloses other options, though the escalation is linear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of yearning emerges organically from particulars like the hunter's arrow tip and kaleidoscopic glyphs, culminating in a non-literal answer with the bell's whisper for the "next world." Subtext operates through recursive imagery, avoiding moralizing while inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic-mechanical voice ("drunken cog-toy," "gears interlocking mid-air like mechanical fireflies") that reflects Zeta's perception. Rhythm and diction heighten pressure without obscuring clarity, and elision (e.g., the algorithm's nature) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with varied sentence structures and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "longing encoded in motion"), and propulsion remains sharp through peak beats like the transliteration sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story synthesizes steampunk and philosophical elements with originality, as the yearning algorithm and kaleidoscope method feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in tone and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors universals like desire.</comment>
