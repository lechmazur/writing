<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, with interiority shown through embodied actions like synchronizing with the flame. However, lack of contradictory impulses or deep internal conflict limits complexity, though final endurance is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change (coup thwarted) under causal lens, and cost is legible in her exhaustion. Flame as persistent constraint shapes tactics, but cost could be more vividly felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting vividly constrains choices (observatory and flame charge the final image) with purposeful sensory detail. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 gate, though environment is essential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist's agency (stitching counterpatterns) under causal lens, with cost unmistakable in her exhausted sleep. Stakes tighten meaningfully from discovery to action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through imagery (wisdom disguised as foolishness) with resonant, non-literal answer in the ending. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 gate, but no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; poetic voice remains coherent under pressure. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 gate, but elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or muddle; figurative language is purposeful and consistent. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 gate, but clarity is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes stitching, adjacent possibilities, and conspiracy uniquely; risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 gate, but freshness is evident.</comment>
