<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Priest's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, and final choice is earned by prior causality with visible cost (empty palette, deeper silence). Contradictory impulses act in scene as rhetorical devices both resist and invite possession.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing: possession disperses into silence, reconfiguring meaning with cost (empty palette, readiness for next). Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; orientation is clear early, and causality is tight through rhetorical questions warping geometry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful; dimensional anchor and indigo palette constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details (static, incense, shimmering walls) are filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preventing possession) escalates through priest's agency via rhetorical questions, narrowing options and leading to unraveling with cost (palette empties, silence deepens). Under accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through silence as cathedral, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and implications.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and rhythmic, modulating under pressure. Rhetorical questions function as dialogue, advancing plot with natural subtext and goal pursuit.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control; no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, clarity maintained even in peak beats like the question mark painting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is highly original with non-obvious synthesis; tropes are transformed through specific details (audio tape cassock, rhetorical exorcism). Turns feel earned, and risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
