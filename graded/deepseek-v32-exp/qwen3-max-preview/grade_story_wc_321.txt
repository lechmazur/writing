<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The deckhand's resilient positivity is consistently embodied and motivates his investigative actions; his final choice to merge timelines is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his acceptance of permanent transience. However, his characterization leans slightly single-note, lacking internal contradiction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the convergence of ferries, under a causal lens strengthened by the deckhand's agency; cost is legible in the final image of "permanent transience." Orientation is clear early, and structure coheres with a single POV transitioning seamlessly to the grotto.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory details like "phosphorescent pebbles" and "coral arches" are selective and purposeful, filtered through the deckhand's POV; the grotto and radio constrain choices and charge the final image, elevating setting beyond ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from observation to active intervention, driven by the deckhand's agency in studying patterns and using the radio; cost is felt in his relentless work and the conceptual price of transience, tightening under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of transience and stewardship emerges organically through images like the hourglass and radio, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via "permanent transience"; no moralizing or abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with rhythmic control that reflects the deckhand's perception; POV is stable and single, with purposeful compression in phrases like "when clocks run sideways" taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax, with no loops or artifacts; figurative language like "shimmering with ghostly ripples" is coherent and advances momentum, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes temporal oscillation and stewardship with non-obvious specificity; risk-taking in lyrical style and conceptual depth heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
