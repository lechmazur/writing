<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ripple-mark's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with deliberate actions. Her embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing fissures and humming, reveal a hierarchy of values. However, limited internal conflict or contradictory impulses slightly reduces depth, though her earned endurance forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, as the hush blooms and the storm is tuned, with cost legible in the ice melting and beings settling. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight, with the echo stone and ice patterns shaping tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory details, such as the "glacial wall webbed with hairline fractures," and the environment constrains choice by supplying the ice patterns essential to the method. The harmonic caves pressure decisions and charge the final image of balance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, as Ripple-mark's actions with the stone and ice cracks lead to a meaningful tightening where the hush spreads and cost is unmistakable in the ice's release and the beings' transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as architecture emerges organically from events and imagery, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the tuned storm without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the ice dripping as a "returning song."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct with a poetic, rhythmic control and a consistent perceptual signature focused on vibrations and fractures. POV is stable and single, with purposeful elision and no head-hopping, enhancing the accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language, such as "bloom of hush," is consistent and purposeful, with clear propulsion and no obscurity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of silence as a weapon and ice cracks as scores, with risk-taking in the poetic style that heightens stakes. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight and is fully integrated into character and closure.</comment>
