<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation to discover time's texture is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, and the final acceptance of flux is earned through prior causality. Micro-choices under pressure, like placing the jade cicada and the softly spoken dialogue, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with felt cost in the shared pause, under an accumulative/textural lens that holds throughout. Orientation is anchored early, and the persistent constraint of time as granular shapes tactics and the final image, with cost legible in the companion's exhale and the tide turning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory details that reflect POV bias, and the grotto actively pressures choices, such as the pool and cicada constraining observation. The jade cicada as a micro-setting object charges the final image, reweighting meaning without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake in understanding time and the relationship escalates through protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with the companion's arrival deepening pressure. Cost is unmistakable in the pause, foreclosing immediate resolution and altering options through the chronicler's observational method.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transition periods emerges organically through events and images like the cicada and thresholds, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the charged poise, reweighting prior material with ambiguity and emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in the chronicler's lyrical, observant voice; rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and dialogue carries subtext and advances plot naturally. No head-hopping, and purposeful elision in foresight method is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds; figurative language is purposeful and coherent, enhancing momentum. No artifacts obscure causality or closure, and sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, such as in the grotto's breathing description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of time as granular and transition as sacred, with specific details like the jade cicada and tangential foresight method feeling inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical, accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure reconfigures meaning.</comment>
