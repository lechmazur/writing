<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and intensifies from burden to rediscovery, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. Her final laughter is earned by prior causality, showing a decisive change with visible cost. However, internal conflict is subtle rather than sharply contradictory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows an accumulative/textural lens, building through sensory details and memory to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page with cost in Elira's laughter and lingering warmth, and the lens holds without ambiguity. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral to choices, with the ruined orchard and fog acting as micro-setting that constrains the light projection and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes of rediscovering joy escalate through Elira's agency under the accumulative lens, from finding the fragment to creating the projection. Cost is legible in her laughter and the reactions of passersby, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of rediscovery emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in the light projection symbolizing revived joy. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, modulating with emotional intensity. Elision is taught and paid off, and dialogue, though minimal, feels natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has lyrical rhythm and high information density without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats, though slightly dense in places. Propulsion remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of light-painting and memory through fog as emulsion feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the concept is fully committed.</comment>
