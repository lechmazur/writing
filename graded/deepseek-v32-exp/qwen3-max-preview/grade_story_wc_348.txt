<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. Internal conflict is shown through contradictory impulses, and the final choice to redesign the polymer is earned by prior causality with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing as she redefines grief and work, with felt cost in "Loosened grief didn’t mean gone grief." Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; orientation is clear early. Persistent constraint of the river's patterns shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the braided ravine and river foam constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered; micro-setting (chrysalis, foam) functions as environment that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency, deepening through insight from river patterns. Cost is legible in her decision to redesign the polymer, foreclosing rigidity for dissolution. Dominant stake of internal conflict tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars, with subtext in images like the chrysalis and river. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer to separation and connection without moralizing; earned wisdom through concrete experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature. Voice modulates under pressure; elision is taught and paid off in closure. No head-hopping; diction matches character's professional and emotional state.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief, science, and nature feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style that heightens stakes. Specific details transform tropes; closure reweights prior material without gimmickry.</comment>
