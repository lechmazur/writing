<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure driving the arc. The final uncloaking and gardening actions are earned by prior causality, revealing a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as offering bread despite no birds, deepening motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the dripping water and smile reconfigure meaning. Cost is legible in the final image, and orientation is clear early. Persistent constraint of loss shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the overgrown courtyard and tea house constraining choices (e.g., guerrilla gardening in cracks) and charging the final image. Sensory details are filtered through POV, avoiding cliché and integrating action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, from offering bread to uncloaking and gardening, each narrowing options with cost. Dominant stake of finding sacredness tightens through these acts, foreclosing paths with felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the bread and seeds, with subtext in gestures. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the dripping water image, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply internal, with a distinct perceptual signature in rhythmic, poetic prose. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and elision (e.g., bakery loss) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats, though minor density in descriptions prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable, with risk-taking in quiet, reflective style heightening stakes. The "creeping normality" concept is transformed through specific detail, and closure integrates freshness without gimmickry.</comment>
