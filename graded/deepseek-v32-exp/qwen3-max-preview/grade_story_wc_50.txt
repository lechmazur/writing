<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The locksmith's motivation to preserve wonder is clear and consistently drives his actions; his peripheral focus is embodied in specific choices, such as aligning mirrors to catch light, and his final decision to leave the cavern feels earned by prior causality with visible cost in the preserved echoes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the timer becomes a fulcrum, and the Accumulative lens holds strong through patterned details; cost is legible in the locksmith's labor and the sealed archive, with orientation anchored early by the marble cavern and broken timer.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The marble cavern constrains choices and charges the final image through its quartz veins and light angles, enabling key discoveries; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the locksmith's POV to deepen atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by the locksmith's agency in harvesting echoes, with cost unmistakable in the cracked stalactite and emotional resonance; stakes tighten through light-based revelations that foreclose other paths, aligning with his motivation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of wonder versus reason emerges organically from concrete actions like embedding shards by emotional temperature; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of preserved glimmers, avoiding moralizing while reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that controls rhythm under pressure; purposeful elision (e.g., "seeing from the corners of their eyes") is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "echoes harvested" is consistent and clear, propelling the narrative with no muddle in peak beats such as the stalactite cracking.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The concept of harvesting echoes through light angles is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and specific details like the dream journal glyph deepen originality.</comment>
