<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, embodied through patient actions and micro-choices; the shift from seeds to hands is earned with visible cost in time and effort. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in the collector's shifted mission; accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with orientation anchored early. Persistent constraint of patience shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details (snow, fog, buoy) filtering through POV to pressure choices by enabling silence; the dock and rope constrain actions and charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving ancient methods) escalates through protagonist's agency in coaxing lessons; cost is legible in time invested and mission shift, tightening under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through knots and silence, with subtext in gestures; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("collecting hands") that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with lyrical prose reflecting the collector's perceptual signature; dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in silence and implication.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and coherent, supporting momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Concept feels fresh and non-obvious, synthesizing tradition preservation with specific knot lore; risk-taking in quiet, accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
