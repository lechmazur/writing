<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices (e.g., trembling hand when intending to clip Lindy). Internal conflict between scientific curiosity and awe is dramatized, and the final renunciation of control is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing) as she shifts from studying plants as subjects to belonging, with cost legible in tearing notes and lying in mud. Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory density to the transmuted leaf. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting (mossy trellis, storm season) is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices (e.g., trellis as focal point) and charging the final image of the new shoot. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, with weather affecting action and tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, from studying Lindy to nearly dissecting it, then releasing control. Cost is unmistakable in her weeping and discarded notes, narrowing options and reweighting stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of connection vs. analysis emerges through particulars like Lindy's glow and the nursery's rearrangement, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext operates in gestures (tearing notes) without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control (e.g., lyrical prose under pressure). No head-hopping; voice is consistent and purposefully compressed, with elision taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, with no artifacts obscuring closure. Sentence-level rhythm supports scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of human-nature connection through specific details (Lindy's defiance, nursery transformation). Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
