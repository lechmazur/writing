<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her past, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. Her final decision to step off the terrace is earned by prior causality, such as decoding the logbook and understanding the bench's memory, with visible cost in her dissolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Elara unfolds into light, under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the bench's sigh and her transformation. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the prism terrace and bench constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Elara's POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early with Elara's quest to understand thresholds. Escalation is driven by her agency in decoding the logbook and analyzing grain, leading to a cost-legible closure under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of thresholds and sacrifice emerges through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Elara's realization and transformation, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; prose is poetic yet controlled, reflecting Elara's mindset. No head-hopping, and elision (e.g., wood grain analysis) is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, even in peak beats like the closure, maintaining clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing corn mazes, prism terraces, and emotional decoding into an inevitable arc. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
