<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in purposeful curiosity, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. Micro-choices under pressure, such as kneeling and photographing, reveal values. Final renunciation to leave is earned with visible cost, though internal conflict is minimal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as the inspector carries the image, cost legible in her whisper and tight throat. Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with orientation clear by ~120 words. Persistent constraint of time and silence shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with lunar details filtered through POV bias. The hourglass as a micro-setting object constrains choice and charges the final image, influencing the climax and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes of witnessing escalate through temporal countdown and emotional density under the Accumulative lens. Agency in her vigil leads to a cost legible in the silent aftermath, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of legacy and silence emerges through events and images, with subtext in the unreceived message. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature. No head-hopping; diction and rhythm control heighten pressure, and any elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has varied rhythm and high information density without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, with no obscurity in peak beats like the grain's fall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of lunar elegy and chemical messaging, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in quiet ending heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors universals.</comment>
