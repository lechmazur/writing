<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The coachman's motivation for restoration is clear and consistent, embodied in concrete actions like collecting and planting seeds, with micro-choices under pressure revealing his values. However, internal contradiction is minimal, leaning more on determination than conflicted impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a charged poise with felt cost in the final image of sown earth and trailing dusk, under a coherent accumulative lens. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of seeds and birds shapes tactics without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the jetty constraining choices and charging the final image through sensory details like "moss-furred planks" and "scent of kelp and closure." Sensory hierarchy reflects the coachman's priorities, integrating environment into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes of restoration escalate through protagonist agency in interpreting bird calls and planting seeds, with cost legible in the effort and symbolic act. Under the accumulative lens, a meaningful deepening occurs via density increase in the interaction with birds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of restoration emerges organically through images and actions, with subtext in gestures like crushing pods and bird dialogues, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material through the garden's implied growth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, such as in the conjugation of dead languages. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "sun bled orange into indigo") slightly dulls momentum without harming closure. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements like seed pods and dead languages feels inevitable, with bold risk-taking in lyric style that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise transforms familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
