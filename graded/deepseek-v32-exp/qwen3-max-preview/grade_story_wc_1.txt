<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., tracing the ledger, studying frost) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her transformation from survival to purpose is earned through causality, with visible cost in the closure. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; contradictions like "survival was subtraction" act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost: "she lived in the pause" after discovering the ledger's true purpose. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with patterns (frost, ledger) escalating to a decisive realization. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image: the canyon "held her like a secret" and supplies frost patterns that shape her art. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "grit of ash," "indigo and silver sky"). The environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism, and spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens: her retracing of frost and ledger patterns deepens stakes, leading to the discovery that "the ledger hadn't recorded goods—it had recorded escapes." Cost is legible in her transformation and the artifacts she creates, foreclosing other paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: purpose found in pauses through retracing patterns, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "purpose... was the act of retracing." Subtext operates in images like the frost and ledger, reweighting prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature: "the night breathe through her" and "drifting resonance." Rhythm controls pressure without obscuring clarity; elision (e.g., ledger's meaning) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (e.g., "frost pattern unlike any before: a looping cipher"). Sentences advance story and atmosphere; read-aloud test passes with propulsion and clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the non-obvious synthesis of glass art, smuggler's ledger, and frost patterns, transforming survival tropes through specific detail. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The combination feels inevitable in hindsight, with authentic emotional specificity.</comment>
