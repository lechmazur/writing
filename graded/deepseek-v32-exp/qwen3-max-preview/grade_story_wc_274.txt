<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The archivist's internal conflict is concretely embodied ("fingers trembled not from cold, but from the bravely conflicted storm within"), and her final choice to release the letter is earned by prior causality, showing a credible shift from duty to conscience with visible cost (her arrest). Micro-choices under pressure, like placing the letter on the Resonance Table, reveal a hierarchy of values without diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strong from her decision to use the Resonance Table to the societal impact, with closure as a Conceptual Repricing—the truth nests in the populace, reweighting the regime's control with undeniable cost (her arrest and the emotional outbreak). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of the dormant networks shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The frozen library setting constrains choices (e.g., the Resonance Table as a key tool) and charges the final image (snow muffling the world while walls whisper). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like "scent—iron and jasmine—flooded the chamber," filtered through the archivist's POV to mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens—her choice to crack the cryo-wax triggers the broadcast, narrowing options and forcing a trade-off (personal freedom for truth). Cost is legible in her arrest and the regime's scramble, with stakes deepening from individual conflict to societal upheaval.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the Resonance Table turning confession into contagion, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to truth vs. power without moralizing. The ending image of "truth doesn't need volume" reweights prior material, embracing complexity through emotional specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, rhythmic prose reflects the archivist's mindset under pressure. Purposeful compression (e.g., "within the blink that follows surprise") is taught and paid off, and dialogue (Commander Veyra's question) carries subtext without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful (e.g., "weaponized vulnerability"), and sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the broadcast. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis—weaponizing emotional resonance as contagion—feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the non-physical dissemination ("a frequency, not a file") heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specific details (cryo-wax, Resonance Table) anchor the vision.</comment>
