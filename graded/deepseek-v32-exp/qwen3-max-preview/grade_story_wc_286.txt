<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The potter's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as not startling at the bee and molding the unfired pot. Her final renunciation (leaving the pot unfired) is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the acceptance of transformation. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in the unfired pot and the oasis's surrender, under an accumulative/textural lens that holds throughout. The orientation is clear early, and causality flows from the lantern glass's use to the potter's insight. The persistent constraint of kindness shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory details (e.g., "chimney smoke flattened," "wax pooled in forgotten combs") that pressure choices and charge the final image. The abandoned oasis and lantern glass function as micro-settings that constrain actions and deepen theme, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by the potter's agency, such as using the glass and molding the pot, with cost legible in the unfired vessel. The dominant stake (understanding resistance to change) tightens through layered revelations, foreclosing options with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the lantern glass's glow and the unfired pot, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to change and preservation. Subtext operates through implication (e.g., kindness phototropism) without moralizing, and the ending reweights prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct with a zen-like, poetic perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, maintaining stable POV and purposeful compression. The prose's texture and syntax reflect the potter's mindset, and any elision (e.g., fractured timelines) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold, advancing story and atmosphere seamlessly. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with no muddle in peak beats like the closure image. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes familiar elements (wasteland, memory) into a fresh, non-obvious angle through specific details like the phototropic glass and beekeeping oasis. Risk-taking in quiet narrative heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable from prior particulars.</comment>
