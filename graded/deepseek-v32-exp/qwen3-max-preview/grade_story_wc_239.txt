<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, with credible endurance in unraveling illusions. Interiority is concrete but somewhat abstract, limiting emotional embodiment. Final surrender is earned with cost, but contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with cost in the transformation to "the hush after." Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with spiral arbitration advancing coherently. Orientation is anchored early, and persistent constraints shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and atmospheric, with sensory details like "dust motes hung like frozen stars." The library and dictionary constrain choices and charge the final image, integrating tightly with the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency, such as whispering axioms and surrendering. Cost is legible in the dissolution of language and transformation. Stakes are clear and deepen meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in gestures like the dictionary dissolving. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through coherence, avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with stable POV and rhythmic control. Perceptual signature is strong, and purposeful elision (e.g., time eddies) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful. Clarity is maintained even in peak beats like the dissolution into light.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and ingeniously synthesized, with tropes transformed through specific choices like spiral arbitration. Risk-taking in abstract style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
