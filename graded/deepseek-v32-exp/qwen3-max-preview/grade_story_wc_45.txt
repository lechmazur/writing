<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, e.g., "fingers brushing soil" and "gaze fixed." The final choice to leave the tooth and recompose the past is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the transformation of sorrow. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as pity instead of horror, deepening character under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost—the tooth pulsing "like a heart remembering how to beat"—under an accumulative/textural lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with taught patterns, such as the garden's paradoxes, leading to a decisive change in meaning without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details like "cinnamon and ozone" filtering through POV. The secret garden and micro-setting (the tooth, river stone) constrain choices and charge the final image, altering tactics and deepening thematic resonance without generic placeholder elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake in healing and understanding escalates under the accumulative lens through protagonist agency—placing the tooth, invoking repair—leading to a tightening that forecloses options with cost legible in the tooth's rooting. Pressure coheres and deepens without coincidence, driven by her actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars, such as the tooth as a "shard of moonlight," with subtext in gesture and image. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the pulsing tooth, reweighting prior material without moralizing, and embracing complexity through earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a lyrical, perceptual signature; voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping. Purposeful compression and poetic syntax, e.g., "turn mistakes into constellations," are taught and paid off at closure, enhancing rhythm and clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language serves atmosphere and momentum, e.g., "like a heart remembering how to beat." Sentences advance story with clarity, and no overwriting muddles peak beats or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of changeling myth, transformed by specific details like "bone setting" and emotional depth. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise feels inevitable in hindsight, avoiding template plots.</comment>
