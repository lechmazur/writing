<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "fingers trembled—not from fear, but from recognition"). Final choice to carry truth lightly is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the mirror scene and village awakening. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her productive fidgeting contrasting with her guilt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as she accepts her past self, costing her former identity but freeing the village; inferred accumulative/textural lens holds through density of symbolic unraveling. Orientation is anchored early (exiled tutor, time-frozen village). Cost is legible in the mirror's dissolution and tapestries reknitting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "cobblestones held their breath" and "metallic walls gleaming cold." The platinum labyrinth and tapestries constrain choices and charge the final image by mirroring her internal journey. Micro-setting (tapestries) evolves with her actions, altering tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of self-forgiveness escalates under accumulative lens through her winnowing, which deepens emotional pressure and narrows options. Agency drives escalation, with cost unmistakable in the labyrinth softening and village exhaling. One meaningful tightening occurs at the mirror, forcing a trade-off between guilt and acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness emerges through events and images (e.g., woven hush, mirror) without direct statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in "choosing to carry it lightly." Subtext operates in silence and implication, avoiding moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete through the village's release.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature influenced by her chess background (e.g., "tracing the air as if resetting invisible pieces"). Rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping; purposeful elision in symbolic elements is taught and paid off. No dialogue, so voice coherence is maintained internally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere (e.g., "the woven hush thickened around her"). No loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful. Minor hairline slip in occasional dense metaphor, but clarity at closure is unharmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing exiled tutor, time-frozen village, and symbolic labyrinth into an inevitable arc. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices in character and theme. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure reweights prior material.</comment>
