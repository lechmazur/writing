<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. The final act of leaving the locket is earned by prior causality, showing a credible endurance with visible cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; emotional progression is realistic and contradictory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) when she smiles at the curtains stirring. Cost is legible in the final image, and orientation is clear early. The structure coheres with a meaningful deepening that reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the observatory constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, such as the "cold brass rim" and "curtains of intention." Micro-setting elements like the locket and origami shape tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with stakes in emotional renewal tightening through her acts of leaving origami. The climax when she feels the curtains stir demonstrates a meaningful deepening with cost legible on the page. No coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief and renewal emerges through concrete images and actions, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the locket's journey, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic yet coherent, modulating with emotional pressure. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure, as in the curtains' resonance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, such as "time pooled here like spilled ink." Closure image is sharp and undulled by scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable, with risk-taking in accumulative structure and lyric resonance. The core premise of grief rerouted through artificial vessels is fresh and fully committed, heightening stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors universals.</comment>
