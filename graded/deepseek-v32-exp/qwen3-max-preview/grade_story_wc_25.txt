<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's characterization is concrete and consistent, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., pocketing the coin out of curiosity) revealing her values. Her final renunciation of confrontation in favor of passing evidence is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in Delgado's implied removal. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; interiority is embodied through gait-reading and storm-affected perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal drive lens with tight linkages: coin discovery leads to map, then to keyhole and overheard confession. Closure is a decisive change (Delgado's removal) with felt cost in the whispered consequence. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no teleporting or amnesia. The keyhole's non-physical function reinforces the lens without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—the port labyrinth and geomagnetic storm pressure choices (e.g., static disrupting gaits, navigation constraints). The labyrinth and keyhole charge the final image, constraining tactics. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered (e.g., "sway of stacked containers"), avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (uncovering corruption) escalate under causal lens via Lena's agency: coin discovery, map following, and overhearing Delgado. Cost is legible in Delgado's removal, foreclosing options through her quiet action. One meaningful tightening (coin guiding to Sector Theta) narrows options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (whispers vs. shouts) emerges through particulars like the keyhole opening ears, not statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Lena's fulfilled purpose. Subtext operates in gesture and silence (e.g., passing map to Ruiz), avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., reading gaits, storm-adapted time). Voice is controlled under pressure, with rhythmic prose and purposeful elision (e.g., "whispers travel farther than shouts"). No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent (e.g., "whispers echo longer in steel canyons"), and syntax accelerates with scene needs. Read-aloud test passes; closure image is undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes unique elements (labyrinth worker, zodiac coin, folded maps) into an inevitable arc. Tropes are transformed through specific stakes and quiet resolution. Risk-taking in non-confrontational closure heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
