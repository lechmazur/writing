<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., muttering to falcon, tracing maps). Final choice to draw the spiral is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in satisfaction. Minor lack of strong internal conflict prevents higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with resonant reconfiguration (drawing the spiral) and felt cost; accumulative lens holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight from falcon's return to convergence moment. Persistent constraint (phrasebook and condensation method) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details (brittle air, groaning ice) filtering through POV. The window as micro-setting constrains choice and charges the final image by mapping convergence. Economy and integration into action are strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding river origins) escalates under accumulative lens through protagonist's agency (using phrasebook, whispering translations). Cost is legible in satisfaction after effort. One meaningful tightening occurs with condensation delta leading to action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer at closure (rivers begin where language listens). Subtext operates in implication, avoiding moralizing. Specific particulars (condensation, spiral) deepen reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (dry-witted, precise diction). Voice controls rhythm under pressure, and elision (condensation method) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with no muddle in peak beats. Read-aloud test passes smoothly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing atlas editing with thermodynamic linguistics. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, and risk-taking (lyrical accumulation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Closure feels inevitable.</comment>
