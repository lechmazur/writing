<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to reconstitute courage is clear and intensifies through micro-choices with the mirrors and crystal. Interiority is concrete and embodied, such as when she recalls the girl who believed stories could change the world. The final choice to ask "What if we choose differently?" is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her acceptance of brokenness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration as the ice shifts with possibility, reweighting meaning with cost legible in the final image. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The persistent constraint of the setting shapes tactics, and the closure unit lands with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices (e.g., wind and ice guide her steps) and charging the final image with the mirrors and shifting floes. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV, such as "boots crunching brittle frost" and "groaning ice." The environment actively pressures the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency, deepening through mirrored glimpses to a climax where she confronts her own reflection. Cost is unmistakable in the traded-off acceptance of brokenness. The dominant stake of internal courage tightens meaningfully, foreclosing easier paths of vengeance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of empathy and choice emerges organically through particulars like the crystal and mirrors, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the question "What if we choose differently?" that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and image, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature, evident in rhythmic prose like "calmly intuitive, never rushing, never hesitating." Elision is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, supporting pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with zero loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "jagged edge a scar-map of lost futures." Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh specificity, such as using mirrors to capture empathetic anomalies. Risk-taking in lyric design heightens stakes without gimmickry. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, and emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
