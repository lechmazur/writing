<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, with interiority shown through concrete actions like tracing the snow globe and placing it in the ice window. Her final choice to release the child's spirit is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the sigh of release and fading dream cameos. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the snow globe placed in the ice window reforms the miniature streets, releasing the child's spirit with a felt cost in the echo and dream ripples. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds, building through image patterns. Orientation is anchored early in the first paragraph, and causality remains intact with no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The glacier shrine and melted snow globe constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like "candle flames dance against walls of ancient, blue-veined ice" woven into action. Setting pressures the protagonist's decisions, such as placing the globe in the ice recess, and micro-setting elements like the ice altar are integral to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of salvaging pure echoes escalates under the Accumulative lens through dream analysis and the climax of placing the snow globe, with agency driving the tightening. Cost is legible in the release sigh and the fading dream cameos, foreclosing options with visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of connection through windows emerges organically from images like the snow globe and dream cameos, with subtext in the child's message "You'll be safe." Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the globe as a "window within a window."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, reflected in phrases like "truth, when mishandled, shatters like ice underfoot." Perceptual signature is consistent, and rhythmic control under pressure heightens atmosphere without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language like "breath curling like incense" is purposeful and coherent, and sentence-level propulsion accelerates toward closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes ghost whispering, dream analysis, and melted snow globe into a fresh, non-obvious angle. Risk-taking in accumulative structure and imagery heightens stakes, with transformation feeling inevitable in hindsight through specific particulars like the child's cameos.</comment>
