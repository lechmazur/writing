<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, with interiority shown through concrete actions like pacing and muttering. Micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values, and final endurance is earned with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as agonizing yet persisting, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens held throughout, with closure as resonant reconfiguration (earned stasis). Cost is legible on-page in the water shifting and his calm descent. Orientation is clear early, and mosaic structure with shards is taught and coherent, meeting Track B tests.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like damp walls and stagnant puddle filtering through POV. The submerged sundial in the final image charges closure, constraining choice and enriching theme, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of memory vs. progress escalates under accumulative lens through protagonist's agency, such as interactions with Council and cataloging artifacts. Cost is visible in his endurance and the shifting water, with one meaningful tightening foreclosing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events, like the chronometer cog and erosion patterns, without moralizing. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through the submerged sundial's movement, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice remains coherent under pressure, and elision (e.g., patterned descriptions) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity and propulsion. Peak beats, like the bell tower scene, maintain coherence and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise offers fresh synthesis of familiar tropes through specific details like the inverted archive and sedimentary mapping. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
