<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits of defiance against enforced joy. Interiority is concrete through actions like whittling and narrating, with embodied emotions. The final endurance choice (presenting the box) is earned by prior causality, showing visible cost in continued hollow existence. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as lying to officers while internally resisting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost as the protagonist continues whittling after compliance. Inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held throughout with pattern buildup. Orientation is clear by ~120 words: who (performer), where (farmhouse), when (post-Happiness Decree). Cost is legible in the final image of "whittling absence into artifact."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with turbines and farmhouse looming as constraints. Sensory details like "shavings curling like ghosts" are purposeful and POV-filtered. Micro-setting (bouquet, whittling tool) charges the final image and constrains choices. Environment subtly mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal conflict against societal pressure, signaled early. Escalation under Accumulative lens through density increase: interactions with officers and final presentation. Protagonist agency drives tightening, with cost visible in continued hollow craft. One meaningful deepening forecloses options with trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief vs. compliance emerges through events and images, not statement. Subtext operates in gestures like burning pamphlets. Ending offers resonant non-literal answer via Conceptual Repricing, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is flat and parchment-like, reflecting emotional void. Narration of mundane tasks is voice-motivated and consistent. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off at closure. Rhythmic control under pressure heightens stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high information density; figurative language like "mechanical lullaby" is purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs. Read-aloud rhythm supports momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers fresh synthesis of dystopian grief suppression, transformed through specific choices like whittling as defiance. Emotional truth avoids generic templates; risk-taking in quiet ending heightens stakes. Inevitable in hindsight, with bold structural choices that cohere.</comment>
