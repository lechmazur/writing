<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The engineer's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion (fingers trembling, laugh like pebbles). The final choice to modify memories is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the emotional recalibration. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as the child's abandonment memory clashing with her own lab past, driving the resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (the mirror stitched into a new constellation) under an accumulative/textural lens, with felt cost in the rewired grief. The lens holds without ambiguity, and the orientation is clear early ("under a bruised moon... canyon’s throat"). The persistent constraint of memory entanglement shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The canyon setting constrains choice and charges the final image, with sensory detail (wind combing juniper, owls in binary) filtered through POV. The mirror as a micro-setting alters tactics and resonates at closure. Specificity is purposeful, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with a meaningful deepening as memories collide and recombine. Cost is legible in the rewiring of grief into curiosity, narrowing options and charging the final image. The dominant stake of transforming abandonment is signaled early and tightens through will and neural recalibration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images (mirror as palimpsest), with subtext in implication. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to central questions of memory and loss without moralizing. Specific particulars (toy submarine, lab equations) avoid abstraction, and the final image reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature (synaptic terrain mapping) and rhythmic control under pressure. Elision (e.g., mentor's words) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; prose reflects the engineer's chaotic precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats (e.g., "wind combed through juniper like fingers through hair"). Sentence-level craft supports momentum without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes memory, engineering, and plasticity in a non-obvious way, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure and perspective heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is transformed through specific detail (e.g., periscope as lens for inner seas), and the closure effect is legible.</comment>
