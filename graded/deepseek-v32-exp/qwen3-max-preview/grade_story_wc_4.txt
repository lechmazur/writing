<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. Her perceptively calm focus drives higher-stakes choices, such as lingering over photographs to transmute pain, and her final commitment to return demonstrates earned endurance with visible cost in solitude. However, minor lack of contradictory impulses in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as the final image of the dove gray case among blooms reconfigures meaning with felt cost in the archivist's ongoing devotion. The structure is coherent with clear orientation early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, though the accumulative design lacks causal tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the lavender field and factory ruins shaping atmosphere and mirroring internal states through sensory detail. The environment charges the final image, constraining choice by providing a solitary space for healing, but it doesn't directly alter tactics beyond mood enhancement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the archivist's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as her lingering over photographs deepens stakes and reweights pain into grace. Cost is legible in her solitude and time invested, but the lack of a decisive narrowing of options limits the score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of healing through memory emerges organically from particulars like the photographs and setting, with subtext in gestures and silences. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of ongoing healing, avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and close to the archivist, with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, selective observation. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and any elision is taught and paid off, though minimal dialogue limits full evaluation of character distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with varied sentence structures and purposeful sensory detail. No loops or artifacts obscure clarity, and figurative language enhances peak beats without muddle, though minor overwriting in descriptive passages slightly reduces propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of a puzzle archivist transmuting pain through photographs is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, but it leans on familiar archetypes of healing, limiting uniqueness.</comment>
