<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The child's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice not to return is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in leaving the bunker. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a decisive change with felt cost when the child falls into the garden, transformed. Under the accumulative/textural lens, the buildup of silences leads to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, from the bunker to the trellis, with sensory details that reflect POV bias. The trellis and doll constrain choices and charge the final image, elevating the score beyond mere description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the child's agency under the accumulative lens, with the desire for silence intensifying through escape and experience. Cost is legible in the renunciation of the bunker, though the escalation is more textural than causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as silence as starvation versus nourishment, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext operates in implication, avoiding moralizing or thematic echoes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and close third-person, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The poetic voice remains consistent under pressure, and any elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, though minor overwriting in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of familiar tropes through specific details like collecting silences and the xenial trellis. Risk-taking in magical realism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
