<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to crystallize emotion is clear and intensifies, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., not turning to the crying woman). Final endurance in the still chair is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in embracing truth over safety.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; closure is a Charged Poise with cost legible in the final image of sitting in the motionless chair. Orientation is clear early, and the rocking chair's stopping reweights prior material without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gallery setting constrains choices and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "bare feet whispering over hardwood"). The rocking chair as a recurring object shapes tactics and closure, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth vs. safety escalates under Accumulative lens through protagonist's agency (e.g., scattering powder, responding to visitor). Cost is unmistakable in her refusal to remove the mask and embrace of silence, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of embracing brokenness emerges from particulars like the mask and rituals, not statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the charged poise of the still chair. Subtext operates in gesture and silence (e.g., woman's crying).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control (e.g., "voice curled around corners like smoke"). Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and pay off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "mask like frozen screams"). No muddle in peak beats, and closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of art and emotion through specific details (e.g., mask from teacups). Risk-taking in accumulative style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
