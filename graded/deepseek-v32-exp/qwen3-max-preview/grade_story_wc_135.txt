<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative through micro-choices like listening to fisherfolk and cross-referencing memories. Her renunciation of traditional memorials in favor of the naming tradition is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the acceptance of silence. Interiority is concrete and embodied, avoiding stock phrases. The reactive visionary trait constrains actions, but contradictory impulses are not deeply explored in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing through the naming tradition, reweighting loss with undeniable cost on-page: "The absences did not vanish; they became acknowledged." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building patterns from fragments. Orientation is clear early, and causality is strong through Elira's actions leading to the proposal. Persistent constraint of loss shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the harbor and trumpet valve constraining choices and charging the closure. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, e.g., "salt clinging to her woolen shawl." The environment acts as a collaborator, influencing Elira's work. Micro-setting elements like the valve evolve meaning, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of compiling meaning from loss escalates under the Accumulative lens through Elira's agency in gathering fragments. The proposal of the tradition forecloses other paths with visible cost in the acceptance of silence. Pressure coheres and tightens via pattern accumulation, leading to a decisive reconfiguration. Cost is legible in the final image of woven absences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the naming tradition. Subtext operates in gestures like villagers' offerings. No moralizing; the core concept of navigating absences is integrated through events and images. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., Elira's pattern-noticing bias. Voice is poetic and controlled, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off. Diction remains within character lexicon, and rhythm supports pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variation without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear, e.g., "memory could be a compass as true as any star." Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and closure is undulled by artifacts. Read-aloud test passes seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of grief and memory through specific details like the trumpet valve and staggered intervals. Tropes are transformed via grounded choices, and emotional truth avoids generic templates. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
