<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. However, lack of contradictory impulses in scene prevents higher score, as final choice, while earned, lacks internal conflict. Strengths include consistent traits and credible endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing via lantern as anchor, reweighting premise with cost (etching names, softened reverberations). Inferred hybrid lens (causal/accumulative) holds, orientation is clear early, and persistent constraint of past memories shapes tactics. Cost is legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with tunnel as micro-setting constraining choices (memory-field causes death) and charging final image. Sensory details are vivid and selective (damp, diesel, whispers), integrated into action and POV bias. Environment pressures tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under hybrid lens, from routine investigation to realization of memory-field rupture, narrowing options. Cost is legible in worker's death and her acknowledgment, with dominant stake (truth vs. denial) tightening meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images (lantern, echoes), offering resonant non-literal answer on memory and denial without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, and final image reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic yet precise, and elision (e.g., memory cascades) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is integrated without muddle, and sentence-level craft supports momentum. Read-aloud test passes smoothly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh synthesis of investigative and spectral elements, transformed through specific details (lantern, memory-field). Risk-taking in genre blending heightens stakes, and closure feels inevitable with non-obvious angle on familiar themes.</comment>
