<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in character, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final surrender and transformation are earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her metamorphosis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, with cost legible in her becoming "something more, something less." Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the orchard and spices constraining choices and charging the final image. Details are integrated into action, enhancing atmosphere and pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency in the conjuring, leading to a decisive change with cost under the accumulative lens. The dominant stake is signaled early and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, offering a non-literal answer to love and death without moralizing. Subtext operates through implication, and the ending reweights prior material with resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic rhythm and perceptual signature. Dialogue is natural and brief, and elision is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high density and varied rhythm, though minor overwriting in figurative language slightly dulls peak beats. No loops or scaffolds harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of rebirth tropes through specific elements like celestial spices and cosmic intimacy. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
