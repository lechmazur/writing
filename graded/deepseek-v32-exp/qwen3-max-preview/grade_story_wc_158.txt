<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. The "shyly unstoppable" contradiction drives consistent micro-choices, and Earned Stasis is earned with visible cost in her insomnia and persistence. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in "something like rest" between words. Orientation is clear early, and the postcard's evolution tightens pressure. Persistent constraint of insomnia shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly anchored with purposeful sensory detail (e.g., "gargantuan shell," "bioluminescent canopy"). The shell constrains choices and charges the final image, while micro-setting like the postcard deepens atmosphere. Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transmuting pain into beauty escalates under accumulative lens via the postcard's warmth and new message, driving protagonist agency to sing a psalm. Cost is legible in her continued insomnia but moments of rest, though escalation is less dramatic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of "reef-shadow joy" emerges organically from images and events, with subtext in the postcard and lullabies. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the final smile and continuation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and poetic voice. Rhythm and diction control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity; purposeful elision (e.g., postcard's origin) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "centuries of longing had carved her bones hollow." Clarity and propulsion are maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of war aftermath, poet in shell, and blossom armistice feels inevitable and fresh. Risk-taking in accumulative structure and lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details like "reef-shadow joy" avoid template plots.</comment>
