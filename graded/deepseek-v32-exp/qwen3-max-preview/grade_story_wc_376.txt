<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and relentless, rooted in the character's consistent trait of wilting near dishonesty. Interiority is concrete and embodied, as seen in her physical reactions to untruths. The final choice to become the archive is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her reversed wilting and new purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she becomes the archive, reconfiguring her role with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with patterns of lost conversations building to the ending. Orientation is clear early, and the map's route provides coherent structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices, such as her wilting in corridors with ambient untruths. The greenhouse city and toxic sky charge the final image, with sensory details (e.g., humid gloom, ochre glow) filtered through POV. Environment constrains tactics and supports theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding lost conversations) escalates through protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with cost legible when her wilting reverses upon witnessing truth. Escalation is driven by her actions, like following the map and reading letters, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth and preservation emerges through particulars like the unsent letters and the oasis metaphor, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with conceptual repricing (oasis refilling with truth). Subtext operates in gestures and images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature that reflects the calligrapher's mindset. Rhythm and diction control heighten pressure, as in the dense descriptions of the greenhouse. No head-hopping or unmotivated elision; dialogue is minimal but effective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with purposeful figurative language (e.g., "toxic sky pressed like a bruise"). No loops, scaffold, or register drift; syntax varies naturally to support rhythm. Line-level craft is flawless, advancing story and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of a calligrapher seeking lost conversations, with specific details like ligatures of longing. The concept is transformed through grounded choices, and risk-taking in style pays off without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
