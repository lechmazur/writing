<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as the trembling hand and root-anchoring. The protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling the final ritual action. The final choice to heed and merge is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the dream-self rising and roots deepening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the merging and light eruption. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through imagery and patterns to a decisive change. Orientation is clear early, and the covenant's stirring reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details like the humming canopy and scent of iron, integrated into action. The glade and roots constrain choices by anchoring the protagonist, and the clipping charges the final image. Environment shapes tactics and closure, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (restoring the covenant) and escalate through protagonist agency, such as heeding the pull and pressing the clipping. Under the accumulative lens, density increases to a meaningful tightening with cost in the merging and dream-self rising. Agency drives escalation with unmistakable cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events, such as scars and the eclipsed covenant, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the light eruption and stirring, reweighting dreams versus waking. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and rhythmic control under pressure. Perceptual signature is character-specific, filtering through the visionary's bias. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and pay off at closure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the climax, and the final image is sharp and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes time-rifts, dream-paths, and eclipsed covenants into a fresh, non-obvious angle. Specific details like root-binding and scar conduits are indispensable, and risk-taking in style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
