<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure driving the ritual. The duality of the mask and her serene focus reveal contradictory impulses, and the final consecration is earned through prior causality with visible cost in spent focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative drive lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the pavilion's satisfaction and her spent muscles. Orientation is clear early, and the kinetic parapet persists as a constraint shaping the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with the pavilion and parapet constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details (e.g., hum of sandstone, scent of sage) are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving wisdom's echo) escalate under accumulative lens through density increase and protagonist's agency in conjuring clearings. Cost is unmistakable in her exhaustion and the pavilion's transformed state.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions (e.g., mask duality, clearings) without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the preserved echoes, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature biased toward stillness and awareness. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and purposeful elision (e.g., prophet's words) pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and legible, enhancing momentum rather than obscuring clarity, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in fresh synthesis of concepts (e.g., conjured clearings, kinetic parapet) that feel inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative, lyric approach heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
