<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion in "weep, not from grief, but from snowmelt ardor." Micro-choices like tracing the punched card reveal hierarchy of values. Final choice to preserve memory is earned by prior causality, though internal conflict is minimal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost as the sound "settles" and "roots," legible in the helix embedding. Accumulative/textural lens holds, orientation is clear early. No causality breaks; persistent constraint of the rope shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (e.g., reconfiguring rope in sanctum) and charges the final image with the helix in bedrock. Sensory details are vivid and selective, like "ceiling glows like a bruise." Micro-setting (rope, tools) is integral to pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens, with cost legible in the three-day cooling and emotional release. Dominant stake of preserving names tightens through process, but escalation is gradual rather than sharp.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the helix recharging memory, offering a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in "silences between heartbeats" deepens resonance. Earned wisdom from concrete actions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic yet consistent, e.g., "technically gentle hands." No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent, e.g., "aurora ripple overhead... threading light." Sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of memory preservation through lost wax casting feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details ground universals, e.g., punched card whispering syllables.</comment>
