<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to discover collective grief is clear and intensifies, driving his actions; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as tracing epitaphs and tying ribbons; final realization is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where grief is redefined as a current, with cost legible in the final image; orientation is clear early, and structure builds coherently to the resonant ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Greenhouse setting is integral, constraining choices like tying ribbons to rafters and charging the final image; sensory details are vivid and selective, filtered through Elias's POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake in understanding grief escalates under accumulative lens through butterfly migration and ribbon-tying; agency in Elias's carving and reflections leads to a deepening with cost felt in the closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of grief as a migratory force emerges organically from particulars like poems and carvings; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, modulating with emotional intensity; no head-hopping, and elision (e.g., spectral guidance) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and coherent, though slightly dense in peaks; sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of gravestone carving, spectral mentorship, and butterfly migration feels inevitable; specific details and risk-taking in lyric design heighten stakes without gimmickry, transforming familiar tropes.</comment>
