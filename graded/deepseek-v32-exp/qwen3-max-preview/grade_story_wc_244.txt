<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, compelling higher-stakes choices under pressure. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal values, such as offering the moon rock without correction. However, internal contradictions could be more dramatized in scene rather than summarized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost in the transferred warmth and station's transformation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through pattern and connection. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the final interaction with the man.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid, purposeful sensory details filtered through POV. The station's evolution from abandonment to community is integral to the narrative arc, and spatial choreography remains coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the Accumulative lens, with pressure tightening through story exchanges. Cost is legible in emotional trades, and the dominant stake of curing loneliness is signaled early and deepened meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, with subtext in gesture and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to loneliness through reciprocity, avoiding moralizing and reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Prose is poetic yet clear, and elision is taught and paid off. Dialogue, when present, feels natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythm and no figurative muddle in peak beats. Minor overwriting in descriptive passages doesn't harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of elements, transforming tropes through specific detail. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
