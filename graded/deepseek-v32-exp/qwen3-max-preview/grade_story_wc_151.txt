<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Motivation is deeply rooted in past loss, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as encoding the widow's words. The final endurance is earned, though internal contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong, with closure as Conceptual Repricing in the final image reweighting ephemerality and hope. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the chalk's transience shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and POV-filtered, with the golden arcade and chalk constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens through density increase in encoding acts, with agency driving stakes and cost unmistakable in ephemerality. Dominant stake is signaled early and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like chalk codes and analog contrast, with a resonant, non-literal answer in the final lines rejecting digital speed for depth. No moralizing or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic rhythm and perceptual signature consistent under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats like the widow's encoding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is a fresh synthesis of analog nostalgia and chalk codes, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
