<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's rationality and involuntary truthfulness are consistently embodied, driving micro-choices like occluding speech; final renunciation of the glass eye is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in release. Interiority is concrete and contradictory, e.g., truth as both curse and companion, avoiding diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory density to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she leaves the glass eye; closure lands with cost in "fulfilled in release," and orientation is clear within 120 words. Persistent constraint of truthfulness shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Hanging orchard constrains choice through swaying bridges and decay, while the glass eye as micro-setting charges the final image; sensory details like "moss-slick roots" are selective and POV-filtered, integrating environment with internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of psychological safety escalates through protagonist's agency in encounters (e.g., helping the three figures) and deepens with the cost of relinquishing the eye; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with unmistakable cost in surrender.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of safety through surrender emerges implicitly from particulars like occluding words and leaving the eye; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in "safety bloomed not from control, but from surrender," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature and lyrical rhythm; voice modulates under pressure (e.g., "occlude with silence, with metaphor"), and elision is taught and paid off in closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "fruit hung like forgotten chimes" is coherent and purpose-driven, and closure image is undulled by muddle or overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-viral empathy, truffles as neural softeners, and occlusion as communication transforms tropes through specific world logic; risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
