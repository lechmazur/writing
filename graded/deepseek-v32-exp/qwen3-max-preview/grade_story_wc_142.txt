<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's dual allegiance is concretely embodied through her micro-choices, such as redirecting foot traffic and painting murals, with the foundation stone chip pulsing as a tactile anchor. Her motivation intensifies under pressure, compelling the climactic mural painting, and her internal conflict between anarchic spirit and pragmatic design feels simultaneous rather than alternating. The final renunciation of direct confrontation in favor of communal reorganization is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the postponement of privatization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with pattern-based escalation through graffiti and community response leading to a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. The final mural map reweights options with undeniable conceptual cost—privatization stalled but not defeated—legible in the image of "hundreds gather... singing old carnival hymns." Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the mosaic structure (multiple shards like Midway Promenade, tilt-a-whirl tower) is taught early and coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the raft city's salt-stained wood and rusted railings constraining Lira's tactics, such as aligning graffiti with moon phases and wind direction. Sensory details like "neon lights flickering like tired fireflies" are filtered through her POV, and the carnival atmosphere charges the final image of the community reclaiming space. The micro-setting of the foundation stone chip actively warms and pulses, influencing her decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—navigating gentrification without surrendering memory—escalates under Lira's agency through accumulative density: her graffiti redirects scouts, camouflages rent hikes, and culminates in the mural that mobilizes the community. Cost is legible in the postponed privatization and the "hopeful desperation" fueling nights, foreclosing the path of passive acceptance. One meaningful tightening occurs when corporate scouts arrive, forcing Lira's highest-stakes choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars like the eviction notices turned into origami cranes and the mural map "as it remembers itself," offering a non-literal answer to central questions of ownership and memory. Subtext operates in gestures like the children tracing images and elders whispering coordinates, resisting moralizing. The final image of a "compass rose... pointing not north, but home" reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Lira, with a distinct perceptual signature in her "orderly intuitive mind mapping chaos." Voice is consistently poetic yet controlled, as in "laughter masks the creak of strained pontoons," and rhythmic modulation supports pressure without head-hopping. Purposeful elision (e.g., the stone chip's origins) is taught early and pays off in its warming pulse during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, but slight overwriting in peaks like "hopeful desperation fuels her nights" introduces minor figurative clutter without harming closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts; sentences advance momentum, as in the closure image where "glitter and hand-painted banners" resolve with clarity. Syntax varies purposefully, though dense metaphor stacks in early descriptions slightly reduce propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes gentrification allegory with surreal raft city carnival in a non-obvious way, transformed through specific details like the foundation stone chip and graffiti-encoded messages. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable due to Lira's established traits. The concept of "reorganization" as salvage rather than sabotage offers a fresh angle on resistance tropes.</comment>
