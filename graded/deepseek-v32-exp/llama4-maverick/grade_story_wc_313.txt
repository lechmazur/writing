<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The warden's motivation to heal through storytelling is clear and consistent, but interiority lacks concrete embodiment under pressure, with told emotions like "felt a sense of purpose" reducing depth. No significant internal conflict or micro-choices under stress are dramatized, limiting character complexity. The final purpose feels earned but lacks visible cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, closure lands as Charged Poise with the promise of stories, but the cost is implied rather than felt on-page. The trail of photographs escalates through density, yet the forgotten memory remains unrevealed, weakening the reconfiguration. Orientation is anchored early, and the lens holds, but closure lacks a decisive change or sharp cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like "scent of damp earth and decay," creating a haunting atmosphere. However, the environment does not constrain choices or charge the final image beyond atmosphere; the midnight ridgeway and resurfacing town are evocative but passive. Specificity is strong but lacks tactical impact on the warden's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes are abstract (community healing) and escalation under the Accumulative lens is mild, relying on density increase from photographs without a meaningful tightening or trade-off. The warden's agency is present but lacks pressure that forecloses options; no visible cost is paid on-page, leaving stakes undramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and storytelling emerges organically through images like the liqueur label and photographs, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the "promise of stories," reweighting prior material. Subtext is effective, but the theme remains slightly abstract without deeper contradiction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a lyrical, reflective voice consistent throughout. Perceptual signature is clear in the warden's biased attention to decay and memory. However, voice lacks distinct modulation under pressure, and the prose remains uniformly descriptive without peak stress compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm and vivid imagery, advancing story and atmosphere efficiently. No significant loops or artifacts; sentences like "the air was heavy with the scent of damp earth" are purposeful. Minor purple phrasing ("morbid perfume") does not harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The premise of a resurfacing town offers a fresh angle on memory and loss, synthesized with specificity in details like the liqueur label. Emotional truth is authentic, but the concept doesn't transform tropes significantly; it feels organic yet safe, without bold risks that heighten stakes.</comment>
