<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in past guilt, driving choices; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion. However, the redemption arc feels slightly swift, with the labyrinth journey resolving guilt perhaps too neatly, lacking sustained contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (internal redemption) and felt cost under a causal lens; orientation is clear early, and the tapestry-to-labyrinth chain holds causality. The cost is legible in the final peace and renewed purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details (scent of wet earth, frozen village) filtering through POV; the platinum labyrinth constrains choice and charges the final image, reinforcing the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (forgiveness) escalate through protagonist agency in decoding and labyrinth navigation, narrowing options with cost; however, the internal conflict resolution lacks a tightening trade-off, slightly softening pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness emerges organically through images (tapestry, labyrinth) without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the tutor's rebirth, reweighting prior motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic rhythm; perceptual signature is clear in selective attention to threads and hush. No dialogue, but elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high density and varied rhythm, but minor overwriting (e.g., repeated "woven hush") and figurative stacking in peaks slightly muddle clarity without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of exile, tapestry decoding, and time distortion feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming redemption tropes.</comment>
