<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Aurora's pacifism is consistent but lacks internal contradiction or embodied struggle under pressure; her resolution feels earned only through summary, not on-page cost or micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative lens, but the cost is vague and no persistent constraint shapes tactics; the unlocking feels undramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Setting establishes mood and integrates sensory details, but the recycled spaceship does not actively constrain choices or charge the final image beyond backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Stakes are abstract and escalation under the accumulative lens lacks protagonist agency or visible cost; no on-page reversal tightens options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges coherently but culminates in explicit moralizing ("transformative power of love"), reducing subtextual resonance in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice consistently poetic, but perceptual signature lacks distinction under pressure and elision is not taught or paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic flow but suffers minor redundancy (e.g., "faint shimmer" repeats) and figurative stacking in peak beats without clarity loss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar elements with specificity, but lacks risk-taking or a non-obvious turn that heightens stakes; transformation is competent but not indelible.</comment>
