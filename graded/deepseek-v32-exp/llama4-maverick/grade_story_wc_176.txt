<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in self-forgiveness and purpose, driving key choices like reconfiguring the rope. Interiority is concrete through embodied actions, but some emotions are told rather than shown (e.g., "deep sense of satisfaction"), slightly reducing immediacy. The final choice to preserve memories is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in her journey.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the rope produces a hum, preserving forgotten names with felt cost (her effort and transformation). The accumulative/textural lens holds, building density through process details. Orientation is clear early, and causality is smooth, with the aurora pulsing in harmony enhancing the closure effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (aurora's hiss, candle glow) that pressure choices and charge the final image. The icebound sanctum and ceremonial rope constrain actions and deepen atmosphere, fulfilling the micro-setting role. Specificity is purposeful, avoiding generic description, and the environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving forgotten names) escalates under the accumulative lens through Akira's agency in reconfiguring the rope. Cost is legible in her painstaking effort and the successful hum, foreclosing other paths. Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully, though the escalation is gradual without major reversals, fitting the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory and self-forgiveness emerges organically from particulars like the rope and punched card, without moralizing. Subtext operates in images (aurora holding secrets) and the final hum reweights prior material. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer, though some moments edge toward explicit statement (e.g., "testament to the power of memory").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature focused on craft and memory. Voice is poetic and consistent, modulating with emotional intensity. No dialogue, but prose control is strong, with purposeful compression and rhythmic variation. Minor register drift in phrases like "snowmelt ardor" is voice-motivated and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, but occasional overwriting (e.g., "snowmelt ardor" feels forced) and minor scaffold phrases (e.g., "deep sense of satisfaction") reduce clarity. No major loops or artifacts, and propulsion is maintained, though peak beats have some figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and non-obvious, synthesizing lost wax casting with memory transcription through specific, grounded choices. Emotional specificity avoids templates, and risk-taking in the conceptual frame heightens stakes without gimmickry. The closure feels inevitable in hindsight, with originality integral to the narrative arc.</comment>
