<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Aria's motivation is clear and intensifies, with interiority shown through embodied emotion like feeling "serenely electric." However, some emotions verge on label-only, such as "overwhelming motivation," which lacks specific embodiment under pressure. Her final choice to carry the memory is an earned stasis with visible cost, but minor slips in concrete interiority prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost in Aria's awe and changed perspective, under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the structure follows a single scene with meaningful tightening. The lunar perigee and hidden message escalate coherence, but the lens holds without ambiguity, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "ozone and decay" filtering through Aria's POV. The radio tower city constrains choices by guiding her discovery, and the gorge charges the final image. However, some descriptions lean decorative, such as "otherworldly glow," slightly reducing tactical impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering truth escalates under accumulative lens through Aria's agency in tuning and following resonance. Cost is legible in her altered understanding and wonder, foreclosing prior ignorance. One meaningful deepening occurs, but the escalation relies heavily on atmosphere over active choice, limiting peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in decay emerges organically through the shard of hush and city's echoes, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with Aria's new lens of "fantasy practicality." Subtext operates in imagery, though the concept "shard of hush" is occasionally echoed as theme rather than fully integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, and perceptual signature is clear in Aria's signal interpretation. No head-hopping; elision like "celestial whispers" is taught and paid off. However, some register drift occurs in phrases like "serenely electric," slightly jarring against the practical tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic control and vivid imagery, but overwriting creeps in with stacked modifiers like "serenely electric" and "overwhelming motivation," causing minor figurative muddle. Information density is high, though paraphrase loops like "hidden truth" and "shard of hush" repeat without added pressure in peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of celestial signals, radio towers, and Hollywood fragment feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific setting and character. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is non-obvious and integrated, with closure recharging prior material.</comment>
