<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character interiority is concrete and embodied, but lacks internal contradiction or significant micro-choices under pressure. Motivation to illuminate value is stated but not deeply tested through conflicting impulses or costly decisions, reducing emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with coherent orientation and a Charged Poise closure reconfiguring meaning, but the cost (urgency "before everything shifts") is mild and not sharply felt, limiting impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly described with sensory specificity and POV filter, but Pearl Bay and the prism atrium function more as inspirational backdrop than constraints shaping choices or charging the final image with tangible pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (illuminating value) is clear, and the ripples introduce a meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens, but escalation lacks significant tightening or protagonist-driven agency, with cost remaining conceptual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through patterns and reflections, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in images like the ripples and prism atrium enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively reflective, with a consistent perceptual signature and rhythmic control. No head-hopping or dialogue issues, but elision is purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied syntax, advancing atmosphere and character. Minor repetition in thematic phrases (e.g., "noctilucent reckonings") but no artifacts harming clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of a glazier's perspective with pattern-seeking feels fresh and specific, avoiding clichés. Risk-taking in accumulative design supports stakes without gimmickry, though transformation of tropes is moderate.</comment>
