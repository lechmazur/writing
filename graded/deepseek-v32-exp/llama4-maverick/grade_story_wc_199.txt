<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions like "thrill of mossy delight," but some abstract phrasing slightly undermines concrete interiority. Micro-choices under pressure, such as prodding the speck and building monuments, reveal values and drive transformation. The change is earned through causality, though lacks contradictory impulses in scene for higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as she "emerges transformed," under an accumulative/textural lens where density increases through decoding and monument-building. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The moonstone speck's persistent constraint shapes tactics, but closure lacks a decisive physical act, slightly limiting impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "trees' bark shimmered like the moon," and the arbor constrains choices by enabling decoding. The moonstone speck charges the final image, integrating environment with action. Economy is strong, but slight reliance on visual senses over others prevents highest score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding messages is signaled early and escalates through protagonist's agency, like prodding the speck revealing patterns. Cost is legible in her transformation, under accumulative lens. However, escalation is gradual without a sharp turn, limiting tension peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges through events and images, such as monuments and prophecies, without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "deeper understanding of the magic." Subtext in whispers and objects enriches, but theme leans slightly on familiar mystical tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, reflected in perceptual bias like noticing "moonstone cabochon dust speck." No head-hopping or dialogue, but voice remains consistent under pressure. Some repetitive phrasing in emotional beats slightly flattens rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is vivid with good rhythm, but suffers from minor overwriting, like repeated "mossy delight," and template cadence in some descriptions. Information density is high, though figurative language occasionally blurs sense without harming closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept feels fresh with specific synthesis of seed sorting and mystical decoding, transforming tropes through grounded details. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes, and closure feels inevitable. However, it echoes common fantasy motifs, limiting uniqueness.</comment>
