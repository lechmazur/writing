<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the causal lens, but cost is subtle and not legible as a trade-off; stakes are clear but lack visceral pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges coherently from events and images, with a non-literal, resonant ending; no moralizing, but some explicit statements dilute subtext.</comment>
