<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving key choices, but interiority lacks concrete embodiment; her change from knowledge-seeker to applier is earned but could use more contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change in Elara's purpose, felt cost on-page; causal lens holds with coherent linkages, though minor ellipses in pursuers' knowledge gaps slightly weaken causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices through labyrinthine shelves and charging the final image; sensory details like "scent of old parchment" are integrated with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through protagonist agency under causal lens; cost is legible in Elara's foreclosed path, but shadowy pursuers lack adaptive pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge vs. application emerges organically from events, with resonant ending reweighting prior material; "unheard symphony" motif avoids moralizing but leans slightly explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice reflects arcane linguist's bias, though dialogue is minimal and prose rhythm is consistent but unvaried under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose has good information density but occasional overwriting ("unheard symphony") and repetitive stems ("labyrinthine bookstore"); momentum remains strong without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Premise offers fresh synthesis of tropes with specific details; transformation feels earned, but echoes common fantasy elements, limiting groundbreaking ingenuity.</comment>
