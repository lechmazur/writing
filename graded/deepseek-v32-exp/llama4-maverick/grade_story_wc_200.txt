<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The collector's motivation is clear and consistent, but internal conflict is minimal and emotions like "a pang of curiosity" are stated rather than embodied under pressure. Micro-choices such as listening and humming reveal values, but lack contradictory impulses or deep struggle. The trait "modestly fearless" is mentioned but not explored through consequential actions or costs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as the soul dissipates, carrying felt cost in the collector's satisfaction and the gorge's quiet. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with orientation clear early. Causality is simple but coherent, and the cost is legible in the soul's release, though no persistent constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensory details like mist and harp notes create vivid atmosphere, but the setting doesn't constrain choices or charge the final image. Echo Gorge serves as a backdrop rather than actively pressuring decisions, and the crocodile's tooth is forgotten, failing to meet the 9+ test for environmental impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes around guiding the soul are clear, with escalation under the accumulative lens through the collector's agency in listening and humming. However, cost is mild and fulfillment-oriented, lacking a meaningful trade-off or tightening that forecloses options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confession and release, with "luminous ache" offering a resonant, non-literal answer to healing. However, the stated goal to "integrate laughter into healing" is told rather than dramatized, slightly undermining subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctively poetic, with a consistent perceptual signature filtering details through the collector's perspective. No head-hopping or elision issues; rhythmic control under pressure enhances the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and dense, with varied syntax and no artifacts obscuring closure. Momentum is maintained through selective detail, and read-aloud rhythm is smooth, though minor overwriting like "modestly fearless" doesn't harm coherence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The lost soul collector premise is familiar but elevated by specific touches like the misaligned harp and crocodile's tooth. Synthesis feels organic, but lacks transformative risk or inevitability, resting in competent execution without groundbreaking ingenuity.</comment>
