<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Amaranth's motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene; emotions are told rather than fully embodied under pressure, and the final endurance feels mild without strong causal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density increase in creativity; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she feels ready for challenges, but cost is implied rather than vivid on-page, limiting impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly described with sensory specificity; the radar dome charges the final image as a sanctuary for creativity, constraining choice by enabling focus and reweighting the stake.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes are abstract with no external conflict; escalation under accumulative lens is internal and mild, lacking agency-driven pressure or unmistakable cost on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from her actions and the dome's transformation; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though it leans slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and consistent, though no dialogue is present to test subtext or character distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has varied rhythm and high information density; no loops or artifacts obscure clarity, and figurative language like "meteor hush" is purposeful and clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh with specific details; synthesis of character and setting feels organic, but risk-taking is moderate and lacks transformative boldness.</comment>
