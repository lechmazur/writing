<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative, but interiority lacks deep contradiction or embodied emotion under peak stress; her connection to the arrow tip feels told rather than dramatized with micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change in knowledge and resonant reconfiguration of Lyra's perspective, cost legible in her awe and planned next mission; causal-hybrid lens holds from inciting incident through discovery, with orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as navigation through floating arches and the glowing pool charging the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Lyra's pilot perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Lyra's agency under the hybrid lens, from navigating inverted gravity to discovering the echoes' source, with cost in her transformed worldview; one meaningful tightening occurs as the growth acceleration leads to the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of resilience and connection emerges implicitly from the discovery of the echoes, with the ending offering a non-literal reweighting through the pool image; subtext operates in the arrow tip's vibration and whirling silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Lyra's pilot-focused observations; prose rhythm supports pressure, though dialogue is absent and voice remains consistent without experimental risks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with varied sentence structures, but minor purple phrasing ("whirling silence") and a template cadence in descriptions slightly dull peak beats; no major loops or artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes gravity inversion, echoes, and plant growth with originality, feeling inevitable in hindsight; specific details like the arrow tip and water flow method transform tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
