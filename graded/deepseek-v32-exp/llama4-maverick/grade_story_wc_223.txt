<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characters have stated motivations but lack deep interiority and contradictory impulses under pressure; the crisis actor's "benevolently ruthless" trait is not fully embodied in choices, and the alliance formation feels abrupt without visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Closure achieves a Charged Poise with conceptual cost in the "luminous absence," and the Hybrid lens holds, but causality is weakened by contrived elements like the figure spelling words, reducing impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly evoked with sensory details like the creaking floorboards, but the whispering gallery and chessboard remain atmospheric without constraining choices or charging the final image decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes around unbinding the past are abstract, and escalation through the walking pattern and alliance lacks a meaningful tightening or visible cost under the Hybrid lens, relying on implied rather than driven agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of unbinding the past and luminous absence emerges coherently through images and the ending's poised moment, offering a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, though it leans abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>POV is unstable with head-hopping between characters' interiorities without clear section breaks, disrupting focalization; voice is lyrical but lacks consistent perceptual signature under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose has varied rhythm and good information density, but abstract phrases like "nomadic penumbra" risk overwriting without clarity loss; no major loops or artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Premise is original with a fresh synthesis of elements like the pattern walking and historian's quest, transforming tropes through specific details, though integration could be tighter for full ingenuity.</comment>
