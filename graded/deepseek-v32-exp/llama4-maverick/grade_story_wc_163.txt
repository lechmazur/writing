<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in trait, with interiority shown through embodied sensory experiences. However, the "softly ingenious" attribute is told rather than demonstrated through concrete micro-choices, and the final insight feels earned but lacks visible cost in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the astrologer's transformation. The accumulative/textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early. Causality is coherent, though the plot is linear without major turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with bioluminescent organisms and dark corridors constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, though minor over-description occurs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are internal and clear, with escalation under the accumulative lens through deepening attunement. Protagonist agency in using methods drives the tension, but cost is more conceptual than visceral, limiting higher bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges organically through imagery and character arc, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext is strong in the burnt feather and environment, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical, observant tone that reflects the astrologer's perception. No head-hopping; prose rhythm supports pressure, though some phrasal repetition occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with good rhythm and information density, but suffers from minor overwriting (e.g., "shadowseam wonder") and paraphrase loops ("luminous respite" repeated). No major clarity issues, but artifacts prevent higher scores.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in tone and setting. The core premise is transformed through specific details, though some abstract concepts limit uniqueness.</comment>
