<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in inquisitiveness, with embodied emotion in her connection to the diary. However, her agency is passive; she observes rather than makes high-stakes choices under pressure, limiting interior conflict and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, with Elara reconfiguring the spire as a sanctuary and cost legible in her emotional shift. The lens holds, but the plot is linear with minimal causal tightening, relying on reflection rather than active turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like "frost-etched walls" and "icebound spire," creating a cohesive atmosphere. However, the environment does not meaningfully constrain choices or charge the final image beyond mood, keeping it from higher bands.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are emotional and internal, escalating through accumulative deepening as Elara deciphers the diary. Agency lies in her attention and deciphering, with cost felt in her newfound peace, but lack of external pressure or tangible trade-offs limits escalation under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of love, loss, and beauty in isolation emerges organically through the diary's story and Elara's empathy, with a resonant, non-literal answer in the reconfiguration of the spire. Subtext operates through implication, though minor direct statements like "love could both elevate and devastate" slightly reduce ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and coherent, with a perceptual signature biased toward Elara's inquisitive nature. Prose rhythm and diction are controlled, though slightly ornate, and absence of dialogue avoids related issues. No head-hopping or elision problems.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with varied syntax and vivid imagery, but occasional overwriting ("ethereal light") and figurative density in peak beats create minor momentum drag. No major loops or artifacts; information density is high, and closure remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Combination of icebound spire, encrypted diary, and scattered light method feels fresh and specific, transforming tropes through emotional truth. Synthesis is organic, but reliance on familiar elements limits risk-taking, and closure lacks bold innovation.</comment>
