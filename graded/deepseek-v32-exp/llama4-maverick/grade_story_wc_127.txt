<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dealer's motivation to fuse insight with empathy is stated but not deeply dramatized through internal conflict or embodied contradiction. Her professional thoroughness and subsumption of emotions are clear, but the final choice to depart lacks a strongly earned cost. Interiority is present but leans toward summary rather than peak pressure embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with the dealer's departure and the grotto's dimming, implying cost through solace. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory density. Orientation is clear early, but the cost is subtle rather than unmistakably felt on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The amber grotto is vividly rendered with selective sensory details (luminescent stones, aged amber scent) that enhance atmosphere and focus. It pressures the dealer's concentration but does not strongly constrain a key choice. The final image is charged by the setting's transformation, though not decisively altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens occurs through the deepening process of crafting emotions, culminating in completion. The dealer's agency in weaving feelings is clear, but the cost of her work (solace) remains implied rather than viscerally paid on-page. Stakes are coherent but lack a tightening that forecloses options with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of half-truths and artificial-genuine emotion blend emerges organically from the dealer's actions and the blotter petal's symbolism. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the crafted emotions bringing solace, avoiding moralizing. Subtext operates in the dealer's detachment and the grotto's atmosphere.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature focused on sensory and professional details. Voice is consistent and slightly poetic, though some phrases lean toward descriptive summary. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, and rhythm supports the accumulative build.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose has good rhythm and density, with varied sentence structures and purposeful sensory detail. Minor overwriting occurs in phrases like "emotions that were real enough to be believable, yet not so real as to be overwhelming," but no major artifacts or loops harm clarity. Closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise of a counterfeit emotion dealer is fresh and specific, transformed through the amber grotto setting and static electricity method. Synthesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the lyrical focus on process. Originality heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the concept commits fully to its implications.</comment>
