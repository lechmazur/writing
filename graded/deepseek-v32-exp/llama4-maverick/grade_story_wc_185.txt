<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The mapkeeper's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative, but interiority lacks deep contradiction or flaws, making her somewhat one-dimensional. Emotions are embodied, such as feeling the stone's vibrations, but no significant internal conflict is dramatized. The final achievement feels earned but with minimal visible cost, limiting emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the bloom of hush restoring balance, and cost is legible in the transformed caves and mapkeeper's satisfaction. The causal lens holds strong, with her actions leading to change, and orientation is clear early. Persistent constraints like the ice patterns shape tactics, but the resolution is slightly neat without major complications.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like vibrations and luminosity, and the ice patterns act as a micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image. The harmonic caves pressure decisions and integrate seamlessly with the theme, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the mapkeeper's agency under the causal lens, as her examination of cracks and use of the stone tighten options toward the bloom. The cost is unmistakable in the cave's transformation and her effort, though stakes could be more visceral. One meaningful tightening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of harmony versus discord emerges organically through events and images like the bloom of hush, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the serene silence, and subtext operates in vibrations and resonance. However, it leans slightly toward tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, and the voice is lyrical yet controlled. No dialogue is present, so evaluation focuses on narrative consistency. Some register drift occurs in peak beats, but elision is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and information density, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Minor repetitive phrasing around "bloom of hush" occurs but doesn't obscure causality. No major artifacts or loops; closure image remains clear and propelled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes familiar concepts with fresh specificity, such as the harmonic caves and bloom of hush, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the surreal setting heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the core concept integrates fully with character and conflict.</comment>
