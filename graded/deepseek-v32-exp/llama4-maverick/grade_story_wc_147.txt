<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, though some interiority relies on telling rather than showing, such as "overwhelming sense of purpose."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost on the page, and the hybrid causal-accumulative lens holds tightly; the time constraint persistently shapes tactics and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The underwater temple setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, with the crystal perfume vial and orifice charging the closure; sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the hybrid lens through Kael's agency and time pressure, with a clear cost at closure; however, the escalation lacks multiple beats of tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory and loss emerges organically from events and images, with a resonant, non-literal ending; but it leans slightly on stated emotions like "melancholy."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is consistent, with a poetic texture, though it lacks a distinct perceptual signature under peak stress and has no dialogue to test voice distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold; figurative language like "tangled threads" supports without muddling clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements feels fresh and specific, with transformed tropes, but it doesn't achieve high risk-taking or inevitable originality.</comment>
