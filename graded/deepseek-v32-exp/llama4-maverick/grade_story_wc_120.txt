<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear but abstractly stated; interiority is poetic yet lacks concrete contradictions under pressure. The final resolve feels earned but cost is more told than viscerally embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under accumulative lens, with cost legible in the writer's swelling purpose. Orientation is solid early, and lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is integral, charging choices and closure with vivid sensory detail; the glass spire and frozen lake constrain action and mirror internal states, elevating the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate under accumulative pressure through the mapping act, but cost is more implied than visceral; agency drives escalation, though conflict remains low-key.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events, with subtext in the mirrored horizon and nautilus shell; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is consistent, and rhythmic control supports the accumulative drive without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful with varied rhythm and high information density; minor overwriting in peaks like "chronologically homesick" does not harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable; lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise is transformed through specific, grounded details.</comment>
