<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Akira's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure, such as clutching the porcelain shard and studying ink patterns. However, motivation leans abstract with phrases like "fetching wisdom from failure," bordering on diagnostic label-speak, slightly weakening character-driven causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost when Akira drops the shard, under an accumulative lens. Orientation is clear early, but the ink pattern revelation feels slightly contrived, though it coheres with the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the opal observatory and snow filtering through Akira's POV. The porcelain shard charges the final image, constraining choice and symbolizing transience, elevating it beyond ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation occurs through Akira's agency in defragmenting the ghost via ink patterns, tightening stakes toward wisdom. Cost is legible in her liberation and peace, though stakes remain internal and modest for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images like the shard and digital ghost, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on transience and wisdom. Subtext operates through implication, though "fetching wisdom" nears moralizing but avoids overt statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic perceptual signature, and voice remains consistent under pressure. No dialogue, but elision in ink pattern method is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with good rhythm and density, but minor artifacts include repetitive "midnight solace" and some overwriting in figurative language, though clarity persists and closure is unharmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of digital ghost and porcelain shard feels organic and transformative, with risk-taking in accumulative style. The closure reweights prior material ingeniously, avoiding derivative tropes through specific detail.</comment>
