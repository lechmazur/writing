<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in trait, with embodied interiority in the memory scene. However, the shift to "to become visible" feels slightly told rather than fully earned through prior causality, though it aligns with actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with cost legible in the dweller's continued hiddenness yet hope. Orientation is clear early, and the tape reel fragment payoff integrates well.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details like "scent of old books" filtering through POV; the library environment constrains choices via hidden passages and charges the final image of hidden treasures.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of visibility escalates through the memory-inspired agency in caching treasures, with cost felt in the dweller's unseen efforts. Under accumulative lens, density increase reweights stakes sufficiently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory and visibility emerges organically from particulars like the tape reel fragment, with a resonant, non-literal ending that avoids moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and hidden treasures.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is consistently poetic and controlled under pressure, with purposeful elision (e.g., memory trigger) taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, though minor overwriting like "sapphire hush" slightly leans decorative. No loops or scaffold artifacts; clarity and propulsion remain strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of a crawl space dweller with sense memory feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and transformation of tropes is grounded.</comment>
