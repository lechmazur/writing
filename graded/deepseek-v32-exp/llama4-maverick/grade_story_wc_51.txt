<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The weaver's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion in lines like "felt boundary-lessly trapped," but internal conflict is minimal, and the final choice, while earned, lacks visible cost or contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the tapestry revealing burdens; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, and the grotto setting persistently constrains the action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, e.g., "luminescent fungi illuminated the space," but the environment doesn't strongly constrain choices or charge the final image beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the weaver's agency in weaving, deepening understanding under the Accumulative lens, but stakes remain abstract, and cost, while present, isn't fully visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the weaving metaphor, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the tapestry reflecting inner landscapes, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; poetic voice remains coherent under pressure, and elision (e.g., "whalebone reverie") is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm, but minor overwriting like "boundary-lessly trapped" and obscure phrases slightly muddle peak beats without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes weaving and burdens with specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry, though it leans slightly abstract.</comment>
