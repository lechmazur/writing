<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mailman's motivation is clear and consistent, driving key choices under pressure; interiority is concrete, though the abstract desire "to find where broken promises heal" lacks contradictory impulses in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change and felt cost ("weight momentarily lifted"); causal lens holds strong with clear orientation early; smuggling border and delivery method shape tactics coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory-rich setting (cobalt arcade, neon lights) and the thunderstorm bottle constrain choices and charge the final image; micro-setting integrates seamlessly with action and tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (delivery for redemption) escalates under causal lens via drone surveillance and bottle's turbulence; agency drives crossing, but cost is slightly muted in climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of healing broken promises emerges organically from events and images; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, supported by the storm metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet consistent, though minor register drift in phrases like "otherworldly energy" slightly reduces peak pressure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language ("brittle hush") enhances momentum without muddle; sentence-level propulsion supports closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes unique elements (storm in a bottle, drone border) with emotional specificity; risk-taking in lyric tone pays off with inevitable feel in hindsight.</comment>
