<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's motivation for belonging is clear and drives choices, with embodied emotion like "luminescent ache." The final dedication to art is earned through the tag discovery, but some interiority relies on told longing rather than shown contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as the ache transforms to peace, under an accumulative/textural lens that builds connection patterns. The search incites a resonant reconfiguration, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard constrains choices by illuminating the path and housing the tag, charging the final image with symbolic weight. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes of belonging escalate through Kael's agency in the search and creation, with cost legible in the transformation from isolation to connection. Under accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of kinship emerges through symbols like the arbor and tag, offering a resonant, non-literal answer at the end without moralizing. Subtext operates in imagery and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, and perceptual signature reflects Kael's sympathetic nature. Dialogue is minimal but natural, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with good rhythm and information density, though slight overwriting risks in phrases like "luminescent ache" are pattern-taught and do not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements like marsh-reed sculptor and crystalline orchard feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in accumulative design heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
