<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her methodical curiosity drives the narrative, and the earned closure—finding peace and wonder—is rooted in prior causality. However, internal contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced, limiting peak intensity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Elara's peace and wonder, under an Accumulative lens. The structure is linear and coherent, but causality is looser, relying on pattern buildup rather than tight linkages. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (damp earth, rain) that integrate into action and charge the final image. The henge and vault function as micro-settings that constrain Elara's focus and deepen atmosphere. Specificity is purposeful, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (uncovering secrets) escalate through Elara's agency in comparing footage, leading to a deepening that changes knowledge. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through density increase, with cost legible in her awe and reverence. No major reversals, but one meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of listening to silence emerges organically from events and images, not statement, with subtext in whispers and echoes. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature rooted in Elara's cartographer perspective. Voice is lyrical yet controlled, and prose rhythm supports pressure. No dialogue, so those bullets are N/A; elision is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and information density, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting in phrases like "rain-scoured fresco vault" slightly blurs sense, but no major loops or artifacts harm closure. Read-aloud flow is smooth.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of a map framer using video analysis, with specific details that avoid tropes. Emotional truth is grounded, but risk-taking is moderate, lacking transformative boldness. The concept feels organic but not groundbreaking.</comment>
