<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in trait, but internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene. The final revelation feels earned but the cost is somewhat abstract, reducing impact on pivotal choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost ("weight of her mission"), and the accumulative lens holds. Orientation is clear early, but the cost, while legible, lacks tangible specificity at the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like "scent of melting ice" and the snow globe as a micro-setting charge the final image. The glacier shrine environment is integral to tone and closure, constraining the narrative's emotional logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Aria's agency in touching the snow globe, deepening visions under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the "weight" felt, but the escalation lacks a sharp, decisive turn that forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of connection emerges through images like the snow globe and visions, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "windows of connection," though some abstraction slightly dilutes potency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic rhythm ("borrowed starlight"). No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision in visions is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting occurs in dense phrases like "flickering flames...ethereal glow." No major artifacts, though density occasionally slows momentum in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes ghost whispering and dream analysis freshly, with organic integration. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure image feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
