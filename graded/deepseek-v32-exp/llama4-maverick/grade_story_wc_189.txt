<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The chronicler's motivation is clear but passive; she observes without making decisive choices that alter tactics or incur cost. Interiority is present but lacks contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. The final insight feels earned through reflection but not through dramatized conflict or micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens, with the chronicler's deepened understanding and the figures' resumption. However, the cost is conceptual and not vividly felt on-page, weakening impact. The lens holds consistently, but foresight emerges tangentially without strong causal linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details that enhance atmosphere, and the jade cicada as a recurring object charges the final image. The grotto and starlight provide a cohesive backdrop, though the environment does not actively constrain choices, limiting higher-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake of understanding time's texture escalates through the chronicler's reflective deepening, but agency is limited to observation, and no tangible cost is incurred. Under the accumulative lens, the escalation via density increase is present but lacks visceral pressure or trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of transformation and transition periods is coherently developed through symbols like the cicada and the paused conversation, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal reweighting. Subtext operates through implication, avoiding moralizing, and arises from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctively lyrical and observant, matching the character's perceptual signature. The accumulative lens is supported by controlled diction and rhythm, with no head-hopping or inconsistencies, though dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with strong rhythmic control, advancing atmosphere and theme efficiently. Minor repetitive phrasing (e.g., "warmly observant") occurs but does not obscure causality or closure; overall, clarity and momentum are maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The concept of a chronicler studying time through pauses feels fresh and specific, with elements synthesized organically. Risk-taking in the contemplative, lyric style pays off in coherence, though it stops short of being groundbreaking due to familiar reflective tropes.</comment>
