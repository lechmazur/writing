<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The bell ringer's motivation is clear and drives the journey, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses and embodied emotion under pressure; the final realization feels earned but is more thematic than a decisive character change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost in the "deep sense of satisfaction," and orientation is clear early, though the cost is somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and atmospheric, with the laboratory and luminescent orbs charging the final image; however, the environment doesn't strongly constrain choices, limiting higher-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, stakes escalate through density of sound and connection, but agency is passive and no tangible cost or tightening narrows options; dominance remains abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of connection emerges coherently from particulars, with a resonant, non-literal answer in the ending's unity; subtext in music and shadows avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision is purposeful, though dialogue is absent and voice lacks modulation under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with good rhythm, but some redundancy (e.g., "texture of connection" repeats) and figurative density slightly dull momentum; no major artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing lost sounds and artificial pilgrimage organically; originality arises from grounded details, though risk-taking is moderate.</comment>
