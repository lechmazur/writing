<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eira's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions (e.g., "trembling hand") and an earned change through her interaction with the keystone. However, internal contradictions are underdeveloped, and the resolution, while satisfying, lacks deep struggle or cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Eira's renewed purpose) under an accumulative/textural lens, with cost legible in her newfound hope. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, though the plot is simple with minimal causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with sensory details like "howling winds" and "flowers that shone like tiny stars." The spire and keystone constrain choices (e.g., mist walking navigation) and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (creative stagnation) is signaled early and escalates under the accumulative lens through Eira's agency in touching and releasing the keystone. Cost is visible in her renewed hope, but escalation is gradual without high tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of finding sacred in simplicity emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in the keystone's glow. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer, though the line "the sacred was not something grand" leans slightly explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice ("icebound spire above the clouds"). No dialogue, but perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., mist walking) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and information density, with purposeful repetition (e.g., "lingering luminance"). However, "brilliant dimness" is a slightly mixed metaphor that mildly muddles peak beats without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes fantasy tropes with modern themes (automation vs. creativity) through specific setting and character, but it lacks transformative risk or high originality. Execution is competent but not groundbreaking.</comment>
