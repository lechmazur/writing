<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Aurélien's motivation and interiority are clear, with the mechanical arm and philosophical drive integrated, but the "diplomatically fierce" attribute is more told than shown, and internal conflict is minimal, reducing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in the realization that "the true victory lay not in winning, but in the journey," under a causal lens that holds throughout, with the sundial's coded angles shaping tactics decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glass atrium and brook create a vivid atmosphere that charges the final image, and objects like the sundial constrain choices, meeting the 9+ test for environmental impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Aurélien's agency in the duel, using the sundial to reveal the hidden overture, with cost legible in the climax and realization, though the stakes shift slightly abstractly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the pursuit of knowledge and the sewing needle card's symbolism, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct philosophical voice, and prose rhythm controls pressure well, though dialogue is minimal and head-hopping absent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of dueling philosopher, mechanical arm, and coded sundial feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in blending intellectual and physical conflict heightening stakes.</comment>
