<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Aria's motivation as a "contact tracer for hearts" is clear and consistent, driving her to reassure the grieving woman, but her interiority lacks contradictory impulses or deep internal conflict, making the emotional progression somewhat tidy. The connection feels earned, and micro-choices like extending her hand reveal empathy, but the absence of genuine struggle under pressure limits complexity. Embodied emotion is present in the woman's tears and grip, but Aria's own emotional state remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost—the woman's peace and the fading pulses—under a causal drive lens that holds throughout. The plot follows a coherent because/therefore chain: Aria is drawn by the dead call, uses the hearing aid to track the presence, and reassures the woman, leading to emotional resolution. Orientation is anchored early, and the mist clearing symbolically reinforces the closure without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium functions as a micro-setting that pressures choices and charges the final image, with the mist swirling and clearing in response to the emotional resolution. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, such as the "gentle hush" and the hearing aid's hum, filtered through Aria's perception. The setting guides action and mirrors internal states, enhancing atmosphere without generic clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Aria's agency under the causal lens, as her tracking and reassurance tighten the emotional stakes, leading to a meaningful deepening where the woman's grief transforms into peace. The cost is legible on the page in the woman's tears turning to a smile and the fading pulses, foreclosing the path of unresolved sorrow. One dominant stake—emotional closure—is signaled early and coheres under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory and connection emerges organically through particulars like the hearing aid's whispers and the photograph, without direct statement or moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the mist clearing and the pulses fading, reweighting prior material with emotional honesty. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, such as the woman's tight grip and Aria's reassuring words.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV from Aria is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature that blends curiosity and mysticism, though voice convergence occurs in emotional peaks. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as the woman's whispered confession advances the plot with subtext. The prose has a lyrical texture, but minor register drift in phrases like "incidental heroism" slightly disrupts the consistent tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with rhythmic variation, but suffers from minor artifacts: repetitive stems like "reeling hush" and synonym churn (e.g., "gentle hum" and "whispers") create slight momentum drag. Information density is high, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere, though figurative language in peak beats risks over-decoration without harming closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of a "contact tracer for hearts" synthesizes familiar grief themes with fresh, specific elements like the hearing aid, creating a non-obvious angle that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the mystical premise heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the transformation of tropes through grounded details (e.g., the photograph) avoids derivative patterns. Emotional specificity and conceptual integrity are maintained throughout.</comment>
