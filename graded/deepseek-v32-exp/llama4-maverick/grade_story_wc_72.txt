<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The statue's telepathy and kindness are clear, but it lacks internal contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure; motivation is passive, with revelations feeling externally triggered by the ampoule rather than earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration under an accumulative lens, with the statue's shift in perception, but the foxglove ampoule introduces a coincidental element that weakens causality; cost is conceptual rather than felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The underwater garden is vividly described with sensory details, but it functions more as atmosphere than a constraint on choices; the setting enriches tone without actively shaping tactics or charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes center on understanding the garden's history, with escalation through revelations, but the statue's agency is passive in key turns; the cost of shifting perception is conceptual under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of adaptability and beauty in decay emerges organically from events, but explicit phrases like "power of nuance" risk moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the statue's realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, and telepathic communication substitutes for dialogue; voice remains coherent, though some descriptive passages lack rhythmic variation under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical but has minor repetitive phrasing (e.g., "thread together," "cascading revelations"); figurative density is high without muddling clarity, and momentum is maintained despite slight overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The living statue and underwater setting offer a fresh synthesis, transforming tropes through specific details; the core premise commits fully, with originality heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
