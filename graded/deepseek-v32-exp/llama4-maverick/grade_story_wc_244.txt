<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Raven's motivation to cure loneliness is clear and drives actions, with embodied emotion (e.g., "desperately jocular demeanor faltering") and internal conflict. The final shift from loneliness to peace is earned through catalyzing community change, with visible cost in emotional weight lifting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost as Raven's loneliness lifts and community bonds; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through rumor spread and atmosphere shift. Orientation is clear early, and causality is logical from moon rock to chain reaction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and atmospheric ("ivy tendrils curling around their ankles"), but the station and moon rock serve more as catalysts than constraints on choice, missing the 9+ gate where environment must directly alter tactics or charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (curing loneliness) escalates under Accumulative lens through rumor chains and community shift, driven by Raven's agency; cost is legible in Raven's emotional change and the station's transformed atmosphere.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of connection emerges organically from events, with subtext in gestures and community building; ending offers a non-literal answer—loneliness cured through incremental process—without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct voice ("politely anarchic," "desperately jocular"); perceptual signature is consistent, and prose rhythm supports pressure without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffolds; sensory details are selective and advance momentum, and figurative language ("skeletal fingers") is purposeful without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes disaster relief, mystical elements, and loneliness cure with specificity; risk-taking in combining unorthodox methods feels inevitable in hindsight, and emotional truth avoids template plots.</comment>
