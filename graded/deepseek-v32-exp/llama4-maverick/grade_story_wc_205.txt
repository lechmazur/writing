<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with a credible transformation from revolutionary to chronicler. Interiority is concrete, exemplified by her poetically inclined nature shaping actions like filling notebooks. The final renunciation of her past identity is earned with visible cost in the "burnished sorrow."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under an accumulative/textural lens, with cost legible in her solace and transformation. The shard discovery incites the plot, and causality holds through her persistent analysis. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the asteroid's labyrinthine passages influencing her movement and the shard's discovery. Sensory details are purposeful, with the "dimly lit galleries" and "faint luminescence" reinforcing tone. The baroque architecture charges the final image of her walking away.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering civilization's truth) escalates under the accumulative lens through her agency in retrieving and analyzing the shard, compounded by the external rumbles. Cost is felt in her "burnished sorrow" and foreclosed paths. One meaningful tightening occurs as the shard yields secrets.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of reinvention and solace emerge organically from particulars like the shard and her verse, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through her self-reimagination. Subtext operates in images like the covered mirrors, though some abstraction slightly dilutes impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice that reflects her character, such as "words flowing like a river of fire." No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. Elision in time transitions is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally elegant with good rhythm, but minor artifacts include repetitive use of "burnished sorrow" and some scaffold phrasing like "poetically inclined nature." Information density is high, and closure clarity is unaffected, though peak beats have slight figurative stacking.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (e.g., revolutionary-archaeologist, visible time) feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation of tropes through specific details like the crystal shard avoids derivative premises.</comment>
