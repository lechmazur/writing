<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her orderly nature, but lacks internal contradiction or flaws that compound under pressure. Her emotions are described but not deeply embodied, and the final satisfaction feels earned yet without significant cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with Elara's realization that the vows are living, but the conceptual cost of her effort is mild and not vividly felt. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly described with sensory details like "quartz hush" and "frozen library," creating a strong atmosphere, but it does not actively constrain choices or supply resources that alter tactics, capping the score despite its richness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes around preserving the past escalate through Elara's agency in sampling frequencies, but the cost remains abstract and not unmistakably paid on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, density increases but lacks a sharp tightening of options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the pursuit of meaning, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through Elara's role as a guardian. Subtext is woven through images like the lantern slide without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, and the perceptual signature is consistent. No dialogue, but prose texture and rhythm control are strong, with purposeful elision in the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is poetic and dense with varied rhythm, but occasional overwriting like "quartz hush" repetition is purposeful and not artifactual. No major loops or clarity issues; propulsion is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The concept of a frozen library and magic lantern slide feels fresh and specific, with a synthesis that seems inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
