<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and intensifies, but internal conflict is minimal and the epiphany feels somewhat unearned, lacking contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in the final image under an accumulative/textural lens; orientation is clear early, and the library constrains choices, charging the revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the library and circular window constraining Kael's movement and charging the final image of lanterns, integrating tightly with the arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation is driven by Kael's agency in wandering, with cost legible in his changed perception, though no major reversals occur.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from imagery and pursuit, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the lanterns, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; no head-hopping, and elision is purposeful, supporting pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with good propulsion, but "meteor hush" introduces a figurative muddle, and some abstraction like "hide behind the truth" slightly dulls clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements synthesize freshly into a coherent vision, with the lamplighter and library creating inevitability; risk-taking in atmospheric depth heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
