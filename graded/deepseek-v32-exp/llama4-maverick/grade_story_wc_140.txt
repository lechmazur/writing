<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in the survivor's past, but interiority lacks concrete embodiment and contradictory impulses; the final understanding feels earned but without visible cost in micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost in the emerged clarity; accumulative lens holds strong with persistent constraints (labyrinth, tides); orientation is clear early, but cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice through the labyrinth navigation; the poison bottle label charges the final image with reweighted meaning, and sensory details are purposefully filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency in layering stories, deepening stakes; cost is legible in the understanding achieved, though it lacks a tangible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and erased histories emerges organically through images and events; ending offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing, anchored in the labyrinth metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a contemplative perceptual signature; rhythmic control supports pressure, and elision (e.g., fragmented stories) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops (e.g., "layer the stories") and slight template cadence reduce propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and ingeniously synthesized, with specific details transforming tropes; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
