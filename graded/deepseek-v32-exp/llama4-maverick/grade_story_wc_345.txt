<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Aria's altruism is consistent but lacks interior contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure. The settlers, including Lyra, are functional but flat, with no micro-choices revealing depth. Motivation drives the plot but remains one-dimensional, missing the complexity required for high literary quality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with the planet's transformation, but the cost is implied rather than felt on-page. Causality is clear, with Aria's plan leading to collective action, though the chalk messages feel slightly convenient. Orientation is strong early, supporting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with the orchard planet, floating arches, and butterfly garden, enriching atmosphere and subtly mirroring internal states. Sensory details are purposeful, and the arches charge the final image, though they don't heavily constrain choices. Economy and POV filtering are effective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes of community growth escalate through collective effort under the accumulative lens, but no clear on-page cost or trade-off narrows options. Agency is diffuse among settlers, lacking a protagonist-driven tightening. The resolution feels earned but misses visceral pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of collective hope emerges organically from events and images, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the transformed landscape, with subtext in symbols like the watering bell. Complexity arises from particulars without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient POV is stable and apt, with a consistent descriptive voice that reflects the planet's tranquility. No dialogue, so voice distinction isn't tested. Perceptual signature is clear, and elision in messages is purposeful, though lacking rhythmic innovation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is generally fluid with good rhythm and information density, but clichés like "breathtaking beauty" and minor overwriting dull peak beats. No major artifacts or loops, and sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive. Closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes ghostly guardian, orchard planet, and nebula energy with freshness, avoiding tropes. Specific details like floating arches and chalk messages create inevitability in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
