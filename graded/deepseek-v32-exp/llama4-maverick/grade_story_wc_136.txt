<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Emilia's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her journey, but interiority lacks deep contradiction; traits like "analytically artistic" are stated rather than embodied through costly micro-choices. The transformation is earned, but emotional depth feels summarized rather than viscerally felt under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Emilia's transformation; accumulative lens holds through pattern-building. Orientation is early, but causality relies on convenient elements like the punch humming to life, slightly weakening linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and atmospheric, with sensory details like mist and glow; the vault and cracks constrain choices by guiding navigation. However, some descriptions lean generic, and the environment doesn't fully pressure tactics beyond directional cues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under accumulative lens through density increases (deepening mist, vibrating punch) and Emilia's agency in following arrows and stepping into light. Cost is legible in her transformation, but escalation lacks a sharp, causal tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of uncovering truths emerges organically from journey and symbols, with a resonant, non-literal ending. However, subtext remains somewhat abstract, lacking complexity or counter-readings, and relies on familiar motifs without deep moral ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice consistent, with a perceptual signature reflecting Emilia's analytical mind. No dialogue, but prose sometimes slips into repetitive phrasing (e.g., "starlit vault in mist"), slightly flattening rhythm under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with purposeful rhythm, but minor loops and scaffold appear (e.g., synonym churn in "secrets that lay hidden" and "unspoken truths"). Figurative language is controlled, though density in peaks doesn't fully accelerate momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements like the phantom punch and vault offer a fresh synthesis, transforming quest tropes through specific details. However, the premise echoes familiar mystical journeys without significant risk-taking, and originality is solid but not groundbreaking.</comment>
