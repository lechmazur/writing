<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Keeper's motivation is clear and rooted in melancholy, with embodied emotions like "heart ached," but the abstract concept "teach suffocating to breathe" lacks full dramatization, slightly weakening interior contradiction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the sanctuary is reborn and keeper steps forward, cost legible in the keeper's shift from sorrow to peace; causal lens holds strong with keeper's actions driving revival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory-rich setting like "ashen charcoal sanctuary" constrains choices by forcing the keeper to act on the fading threshold and charges the final image with the revitalized flame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes around preserving the sanctuary escalate through keeper's agency, such as reaching out to shadows and reviving the flame, with cost felt in the emotional journey and ended isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of isolation and revival emerges organically from the keeper's journey, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the keeper's transformation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with a distinct, poetic voice; no dialogue, but perceptual signature is consistent and elision like "loaded emptiness" is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and dense with vivid imagery, avoiding loops or scaffold; minor overwriting in phrases like "loaded emptiness" but clarity and propulsion remain strong, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of shadow keeper and fading threshold feels inevitable, with risk-taking in abstract concepts like "teach suffocating to breathe" heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
