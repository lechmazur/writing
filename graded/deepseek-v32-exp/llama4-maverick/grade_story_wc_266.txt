<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Eira's traits are consistent but lack deep interiority or contradictory impulses; her motivation is clear but not intensifying under pressure. The group's resolve is told rather than earned through embodied conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise with felt cost in the trepidation at the shore; the accumulative lens holds through textural escalation, but causal linkages are weak.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway and mist-shrouded landscape are vivid and sensory, constraining choices by shaping the indirect route and charging the final image with the clearing mist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early and escalate through accumulative density, but agency is passive; the cost is legible in the travelers' resolve, though no major reversals test courage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of courage emerges through symbols like the star stamp without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal threshold without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is consistently lyrical with a distinct perceptual signature; no dialogue, but elision is purposeful and supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic control and good density, but minor repetition (e.g., "gentle persistence") and some decorative phrasing slightly dull momentum without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of mystical guide and courage quest feels fresh, but it relies on familiar tropes without transformative risk; specificity in elements like the ticket punch adds originality.</comment>
