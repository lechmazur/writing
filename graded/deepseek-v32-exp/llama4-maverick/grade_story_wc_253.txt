<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Echo's interiority is concrete and embodied through whittling and narration, with moral ambiguity adding depth. However, internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene, and the final endurance feels somewhat earned but could be more sharply motivated under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Echo's silence holds deep sadness yet a glimmer of hope, with cost legible in the final image. The accumulative/textural lens holds strong, and the wind turbines and bouquet persistently shape the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory details, and the farmhouse, wind turbines, and dried bouquet actively constrain choices and charge the final image, serving as micro-settings that deepen emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Echo's agency in narrating and whittling, deepening the emotional conflict under the accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable in the longing and grief, though the escalation lacks a decisive tightening of options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Echo's actions and the recurring bouquet, offering a non-literal answer on grief and art's transformative power without moralizing. Subtext is rich in imagery and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, rhythmic control that reflects Echo's perceptual signature. No head-hopping; elision and compression are purposeful and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied syntax, though minor overwriting ("weaving a hypnotic spell") slightly dulls peak beats. No loops or scaffolds; clarity and momentum are maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-collapse world and personal grief feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the quiet, reflective style heightening stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors universals.</comment>
