<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lena's characterization is consistent with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as her decisively kind touch and the use of music to reunify Emma. Emma's spark of hope and frailty add depth. The final choice to execute a flawless goodbye is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in Emma's peaceful passing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Emma dies peacefully, with felt cost in Lena's continued presence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory layers. Orientation is clear early, and the single-scene structure tightens effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like scent of flowers and pulsing stillness, constraining choices by influencing Lena's music therapy. The haven above clouds charges the final image, though some descriptions border on overly poetic without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of Emma's peaceful death escalates after blood work results, driven by Lena's agency to reunify her. Cost is legible in Emma's slowed breathing and smile under the Accumulative lens, with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of hope and music transcending death emerges through particulars like the vinyl shard and scent, with subtext in gestures. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though slightly explicit in places.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Lena's poetic voice. Rhythm controls pressure, and elision (e.g., hymning the mundane) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no major loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "pulsing stillness" is purposeful, though minor overwriting in metaphors doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Originality lies in the synthesis of hospice music therapy and scent of hope, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in quiet ending heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
