<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Aria's motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority lacks concrete embodiment; emotions like "surge of gratitude" are told rather than shown through specific actions. The transformation feels earned but relies on external guidance rather than deep internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost in Aria's worldview shift, but the Accumulative lens holds weakly due to over-reliance on coincidence (e.g., old woman's abrupt appearance) rather than character-driven causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "black sand beach" and "rumbling volcano," creating atmosphere, but it does not constrain choices or charge the final image beyond mood, limiting higher-band potential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes are abstract (understanding the universe), and escalation under the Accumulative lens occurs through sensory density, but Aria's passive agency reduces pressure; cost is felt but not driven by proactive choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of cosmic connection emerges through images like the lightning bugs and whispering hush, offering a non-literal resolution, but leans toward abstract philosophizing in lines like "complex web of connections," slightly undermining concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively lyrical, with perceptual bias in phrases like "whispering hush," but minor repetitive phrasing and elevated diction in peaks cause slight register drift without harming closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and density, but figurative language like "texture of transformation" borders on purple in high-pressure beats; no major artifacts, though some abstraction slightly dulls momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements like destitute philanthropist and bottled lightning bugs feels fresh and organic, with risk in accumulative structure; specific details avoid cliché and support closure.</comment>
