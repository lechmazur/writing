<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The survivor's motivation to translate silence into music is clear and embodied, but internal conflict is minimal, and the collaborative resolution lacks strong contradictory impulses or a deeply earned cost. Emotions are shown through sensory details like "chill on her skin," yet some moments, such as "sense of peace," lean toward summary. The relationship with Eli advances the stake but does not force a consequential trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early, and the accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory and emotional density toward a Charged Poise closure as the survivor carries the music forward. The cost is felt in the contrast between the inner warmth and outer chill, though it remains subtle. The single-scene structure coheres, with the collaboration unfolding naturally without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is vividly rendered with selective sensory details (e.g., "frosted panes," "hum of the heating system") that charge the final image and subtly mirror internal states. However, the setting does not directly constrain choices, serving more as an atmospheric backdrop than a tactical pressure point. Spatial choreography is clean, and details are integrated through the POV's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake of creating music from silence escalates through the protagonists' agency in using the heat-map and tuning forks to rectify discord, under the accumulative lens. A meaningful deepening occurs as they achieve harmony, but no live options are foreclosed, and the cost, while legible in their satisfaction, lacks visceral weight. Pressure coheres but does not tighten significantly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the pursuit of beauty in silence, avoiding moralizing and culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer with the image of carrying music. Subtext operates in gestures and shared creation, but the concept of "unshaken marvels" is echoed rather than deeply integrated into choices. The ending reweights prior material without overt statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature filtering details through the survivor's sensory and emotional lens. Voice is consistent and slightly poetic, modulating with the serene atmosphere. Dialogue is minimal but functional; no head-hopping or register shifts disrupt coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits strong rhythmic control and high information density, with sentences advancing character and atmosphere without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language, such as "vibrations like ripples on a pond," is purposeful and clear. Minor purple notes (e.g., "symphony of silence") fit the tone and do not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise of creating music in a silent world feels fresh and specific, synthesizing emotion mapping and tuning forks into a coherent vision. Tropes are transformed through grounded character choices, though the execution leans toward serene resolution rather than bold risk-taking. Emotional truth and specificity elevate it above template plots.</comment>
