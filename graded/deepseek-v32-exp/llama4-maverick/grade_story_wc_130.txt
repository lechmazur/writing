<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in deep-seated desire, with embodied emotion in "weight of ambiguous loss." Micro-choices under pressure, like weaving patterns, reveal character, but the intellectual nature of "mathematics of emotion" slightly abstracts interiority. Final understanding feels earned through ritual causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an accumulative lens, with cost legible in "weight of ambiguous loss" and "buried optimism." Orientation is clear early, and the mosaic stone and glass eyes shape tactics persistently. Lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "luminescent fungi" and "rustle of leaves," and it constrains choice through the orchard's silence and mosaic stone. The environment charges the final image as a "realm of possibility," meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation occurs through density increase in the ritual, driven by the conjurer's agency. Cost is legible in the "ambiguous loss," and stakes tighten meaningfully, though the shift is more internal than external.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of mathematics of emotion and ambiguous loss emerges organically through images and action, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "buried optimism," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic syntax and rhythmic control. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, such as in the ritual description, and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is coherent, and rhythm supports the accumulative build, though minor purple phrasing doesn't harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes familiar elements with fresh specificity, like using glass eyes for scrying emotions. Risk-taking in lyricism heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable, though not fully transformative of tropes.</comment>
