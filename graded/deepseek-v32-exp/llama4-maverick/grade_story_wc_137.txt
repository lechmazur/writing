<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Emilia's motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete interiority shown through her determination and attunement to the sea. However, the trait "courageously kind" is told rather than demonstrated with cost, and internal conflict is minimal, lacking contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as peace settles and memories are given voice, with cost legible in the atmosphere shift. The accumulative lens holds, and orientation is clear early, though the tile's magic feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the tower and sea charging the final image. However, the environment does not strongly constrain choices; it serves more as backdrop than crucible, limiting its impact on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes around unlocking memories escalate through Emilia's transcription, driven by her agency under the accumulative lens. Cost is felt in her transformation and the tower's shift, but escalation is gradual without sharp turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory and connection emerges organically from symbols and events, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the symphony of whales and entangled memories, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature. No head-hopping; voice remains consistent, though it occasionally leans toward abstraction without losing coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is generally fluid with good rhythm and density, but minor label-speak like "courageously kind determination" and slight overwriting in peak beats cause small artifacts without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of skeptic, magic tile, and whale migration, feeling organic and inevitable. Risks with mystical elements heighten stakes without gimmickry, though some tropes are familiar.</comment>
