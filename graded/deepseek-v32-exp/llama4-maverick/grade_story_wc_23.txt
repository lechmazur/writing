<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Navigator's motivation is clear and rooted in loss, with embodied emotions and micro-choices like handling the censer foot. Interiority is concrete, and the final acceptance feels earned through prior causality, though some moments lack contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as she reaches acceptance, under an accumulative lens that builds through sensory patterns. The moon phase constraint shapes tactics, and orientation is clear early, but the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the censer foot as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory details reflect POV bias, and the starlit station acts as a beacon that pressures decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes around navigating loss escalate through protagonist agency, driven by cryptic calls and moon phases, with cost legible in her journey. The accumulative lens supports a meaningful deepening that forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of loss and resilience emerges through images like the censer foot and reverse migration, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through acceptance. No moralizing, and subtext operates in implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and poetic rhythm. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., cryptic calls) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, and sentences advance story momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements like patchwork navigator and moon phases synthesize into a fresh, non-obvious concept that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional truth avoids templates.</comment>
