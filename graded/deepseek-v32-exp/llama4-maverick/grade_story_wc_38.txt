<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Aria's motivation to escape through code-breaking is clear and intensifies, but the concept of encrypting vulnerability as strength is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or concrete trade-offs, reducing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration under an accumulative lens with Aria's liberation, but the cost is conceptual rather than vividly felt on-page, slightly diminishing impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensory details like saltwater decay and the spider web are vivid and purposeful, but the setting functions more as atmosphere than a constraint that actively shapes choices or charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Aria's agency in journaling and decoding under the accumulative lens, but the pressure lacks a sharp tightening or visible cost that forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of calm defiance and transformation emerge organically through symbols like the dice and web, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctly lyrical, with Aria's perceptual signature consistent throughout and no head-hopping, though dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density, but minor repetitive mentions of "hangman's dice" create slight template cadence without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of code-breaking, dance, and symbolic objects feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric mode that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
