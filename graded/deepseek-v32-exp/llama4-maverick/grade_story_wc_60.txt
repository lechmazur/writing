<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Aria's motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority lacks embodied contradiction; emotions are stated rather than shown through specific physicality, such as "heart swelled with excitement and trepidation" feeling tell-y. Micro-choices under pressure are present but not deeply conflicted, limiting emotional complexity. The final choice to open the box is earned, but cost is lightly felt, keeping it from higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration under the Accumulative/Textural lens: memories released and city reborn, with cost legible in Aria's "newfound responsibility." Orientation is clear early, and breadcrumbs create coherent linkage. Sidereal patience shapes pacing, but the lens holds without ambiguity, though cost could be more visceral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "rustle of leaves" and "glimmer of color" filtering through Aria's POV. The stained glass box acts as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean, and the city's evolution supports the arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes (liberating memories) escalate through accumulative breadcrumbs, driven by Aria's agency. Cost is conceptual (responsibility) and legible at closure. Under the Accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, but the escalation lacks a tightening that forecloses options with high visceral impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory and rebirth emerges organically through images like fountains flowing, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with Aria as guardian. Subtext operates in implication, but some moments risk slight abstraction, such as "realistically imaginative spirit."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, though perceptual signature can be uniform. No dialogue, but prose reflects Aria's bias. Purposeful compression in breadcrumb-following is taught and legible, but minor register consistency issues prevent higher scores.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose has varied rhythm and good density, but elevated diction like "luminous skeptic" and "sidereal patience" occasionally clashes with POV, hinting at register drift. No major loops or artifacts, and closure image is clear, though overwriting checks apply lightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Concept feels fresh with specific synthesis of forgotten fountains and memory liberation, resisting tropes through grounded details. Transformation test passes, but risk-taking is moderate; the premise isn't fully indispensable, leaning on familiar quest structures.</comment>
