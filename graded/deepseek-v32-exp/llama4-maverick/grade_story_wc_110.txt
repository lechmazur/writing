<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Character shows concrete interiority and embodied emotion, with motivation rooted in transparency. The final resolution feels earned through prior reflections, though some abstract phrasing slightly dulls impact. Micro-choices with the lens and tickets reveal values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost (peace and purpose found). Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, oriented early. The crystal monolith and lens transformation charge the ending without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and selective, with the crystal forecourt and lens constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory details like wet stone and resonant hush are woven into action, mirroring internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes of overcoming mistrust escalate through agency (walking, deciphering doodles) under accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the thawing of secrecy, with one meaningful tightening foreclosing prior burdens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of honesty emerges through particulars like the lens and doodles, not statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the transformed lens, avoiding moralizing. Subtext in cryptic messages enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is clear in biased noticing. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., doodle meanings) is taught and pays off. Rhythm controls pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with purposeful repetition (e.g., "resonant hush"). Minor overwriting in phrases like "ambiguously clear" but no loops or artifacts harming closure. Sentence propulsion supports accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (crystal setting, projector lens, doodles) feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details avoid template plots, offering fresh inflection.</comment>
