<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The sentinel's motivation is clear but shallow, with told emotions rather than embodied conflict. Her "calmly inventive" trait is demonstrated in deciphering the code, but internal contradiction is lacking. The final choice to activate the cradle feels earned but lacks visible personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with logical linkages from blackout to revolution. Closure is a decisive change with implied cost, but the cost is vague ("darkness vanquished") and not deeply felt. Orientation is clear early, but the sundial method feels convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Setting is atmospheric but generic, with sensory details like "inky darkness" and "faint moonlight." The blackout and sundial constrain choices weakly, but the environment doesn't strongly pressure tactics or charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (guarding vs. revolution), and escalation is driven by protagonist agency under causal lens. However, cost is abstract ("new era") rather than concretely felt, and the conflict resolution lacks lasting consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Theme of revolution emerges from events but is stated directly, with moralizing in the final paragraph ("symbol of the power of courage"). Subtext is present in objects, but the ending lacks a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, but voice is somewhat flowery and lacks distinct perceptual signature. No dialogue; prose is descriptive but overrelies on ornate phrasing like "soft, ethereal light" without clear purpose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variation but shows overwriting (e.g., "otherworldly glow") and minor repetition ("silent revolution"). Information density is moderate, with no severe artifacts, but clarity suffers in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Premise combines familiar tropes (guardian, artifact, revolution) without fresh transformation. Synthesis is coherent but not innovative; elements feel derivative and lack bold risk-taking.</comment>
