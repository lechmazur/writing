<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The coachman's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a vision for rebirth, but lacks internal conflict or flaws, reducing complexity. Micro-choices like selecting seed pods reveal values, but no contradictory impulses undercut depth. The final act is earned but without visible personal cost, limiting emotional impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the land is reborn, under an accumulative lens that holds through descriptive density. Orientation is clear early, and the cost of past desolation is felt conceptually. However, the positive resolution lacks a tangible price, slightly diminishing resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like blooming flowers and birdsong, filtered through the coachman's POV. The dying reef pressures his choice to fertilize, charging the final image of renewal. Capped due to Q2 not reaching 9.0, but execution is strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start, and escalation under the accumulative lens builds through density to the fertilization act. Agency drives the progression, but no tightening forecloses options or imposes a unmistakable cost, leaving escalation somewhat gentle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of rebirth and harmony emerges organically from images like the garden reclaiming a battlefield, without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material through a resonant, non-literal answer, though it leans hopeful rather than complex.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice attuned to nature; perceptual signature is consistent. No dialogue, but rhythmic control and elision are purposeful, supporting the accumulative design without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has varied rhythm and high information density, with no loops or artifacts obscuring clarity. Figurative language like "submerged concord" is integrated without muddle. Capped due to Q2 not reaching 9.0, but line-level craft is excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The combination of mystical coachman, dead languages, and ecological renewal feels unique and specific, transforming tropes through grounded details. Risk-taking in poetic style coheres, offering a non-obvious synthesis that supports closure.</comment>
