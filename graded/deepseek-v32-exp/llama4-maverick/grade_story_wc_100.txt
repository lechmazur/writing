<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and rooted in trait (inadvertent stubbornness), with embodied emotion and earned change. However, internal conflict is minimal, and the journey from weariness to purpose is straightforward without deep contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly with clear because/therefore linkages. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in the undertaker's peace and guardianship. Orientation is anchored early, and the broken lens constrains tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details (e.g., "dark, icy waters," "eerie stillness") that pressure choices and charge the final image. The underwater library and lighthouse lens are integral to the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revitalizing the signal to find stillness) escalates under causal lens through protagonist agency. Cost is legible in the undertaker's effort and transformation, with a meaningful tightening as the signal shifts from distress to invitation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of rest and purpose emerges organically from events and images, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the pulsing signal and the undertaker's serenity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature focused on stillness and weariness. Voice is consistent and reflective, though slightly monochromatic under pressure. No head-hopping or dialogue issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is propulsive with varied rhythm and high information density. No artifacts like loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of undertaker, underwater library, and lighthouse lens feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking is moderate but integrated, though the core premise leans on familiar archetypes without full transformation.</comment>
