<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation to discover beauty in the incomplete is clear and drives key choices, embodied in concrete actions like weaving the poem. Interiority is specific and character-particular, with emotions filtered through sensory perception. The final acceptance of transience is earned by the feather and kite string snap, with visible cost in the smile and understanding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in the kite string snap symbolizing transience. Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, building through sensory patterns. Orientation is immediate and clear, with no causality breaks. Persistent constraint of transience shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like the cobalt lagoon and wet sand charging the final image of peace. Environment constrains choice indirectly by fueling the poet's reflection. Details are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering beauty in transience escalates under Accumulative lens through density increase (feather, poem, kite snap). Agency drives escalation via poem-weaving and acceptance. Cost is legible in the piercing kite twang and her serene response.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in transience emerges organically from images and events, with subtext in the feather and kite snap. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the poet's carried memory. No moralizing; wisdom earned through specific particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature that reflects the poet's mindset. Voice controls rhythm and diction under pressure, e.g., "burnished hush." No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, e.g., "woven dawns." No artifacts obscure causality or closure; sentences propel momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar themes (transience, beauty) through specific details like the drake's feather and woven poem. Risk-taking in quiet, lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight but not groundbreaking.</comment>
