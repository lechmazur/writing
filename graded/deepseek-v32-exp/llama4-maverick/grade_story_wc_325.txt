<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear but internal conflict is told rather than shown through micro-choices; her claustrophobia is stated but doesn't constrain actions, and the connection to the unremembered lacks embodied emotion. The final change in her connection to invisible things is earned but feels abstract without visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure is on-page with a decisive change (emergence on surface) and cost (deafening roar, pressure shift) under a Causal lens; phase transitions are introduced late but linkages are logical. Orientation is clear early, though the tidal timeframe is underutilized for persistent pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid with sensory details (anemones, dark corridors) and constrains choices via tidal currents and cramped spaces; the facility charges the final image but relies heavily on visual description over other senses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve codex) escalates with tidal changes, forcing quick action; agency in using phase transitions drives resolution with legible cost (physical strain), but conflict lacks high stakes or deep moral calculus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of standing by the unremembered emerges through events and Lyra's motivation, with resonant subtext in the final image; avoids moralizing but is occasionally stated overtly, reducing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with consistent perceptual signature; prose is functional but lacks distinct rhythmic control or vivid idiom. No dialogue present, so voice remains serviceable without standout texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose advances story with good information density, but minor repetitions (e.g., "codex clutched tightly") and template cadence occur; no major artifacts harm clarity, though figurative language is sparse.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of spelunker, undersea cables, and phase transitions feels organic; tropes are transformed through specific setting and stakes, but emotional depth is conventional, limiting ingenuity.</comment>
