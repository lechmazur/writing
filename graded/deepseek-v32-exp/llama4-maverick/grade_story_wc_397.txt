<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure showing a shift from escape to purpose. The final earned stasis is motivated by prior causality, though minor abstract phrasing like "sense of detachment" slightly reduces specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost legible in the fragile peace. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, though the transition to relief work is somewhat abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and selective, constraining choices and charging the final image. The drift-ice marina pressures tactics through its desolate serenity, and details like "light danced across the ice" are POV-filtered and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist's agency in joining relief work, shifting motivation under the Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in the acceptance of fragility, but the escalation relies heavily on reflection rather than external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence and second chances emerges through particulars like the sound of endings and parasol tip, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in images deepens complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and lyrical rhythm. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., hazy memories) is taught and pays off, though minor register drift occurs in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with varied syntax, but suffers from minor paraphrase loops (e.g., "sense of detachment" and "windborne solace" repeated) and occasional abstract diction that dulls momentum in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Premise of euthanasia tourist transformed through specific, grounded details and emotional specificity. Synthesis feels inevitable, but risk-taking is moderate, with some reliance on familiar introspective tropes.</comment>
