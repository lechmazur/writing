<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and emotions are embodied, but some feelings like "sense of disorientation" are told rather than shown, reducing depth. The character's adaptive trait is demonstrated, and motivation drives key choices, though internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) where cost is felt in her peace and purpose. Orientation is clear early, and the ledger-frost pattern linkage coheres, though some summary elements slightly dilute causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with frost patterns constraining choice and charging the final image. The canyon mirrors internal states and guides action, though occasional cliché phrasing like "world seemed to hold its breath" limits higher band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake in legacy and purpose escalates through protagonist agency in connecting ledger and frost patterns. Under accumulative lens, density increases with visible cost in emotional clarity, but escalation is subtle and lacks sharp tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of fragility and purpose emerges through images and actions without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext in patterns enriches meaning, though some thematic echoes like "discover purpose in the pauses" edge toward statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and poetic tone. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., ledger details) is taught and paid off, but no dialogue to test character distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with good rhythm, but repetitive phrases like "scorched testament" and synonym churn ("drifting resonance") create minor artifacts. Information density is high, though overwriting in peaks slightly muddles clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of glass art, ledger, and frost patterns feels organic and non-derivative. Risk-taking in quiet reflection heightens stakes, and specificity anchors universals, but some elements like "scorched testament" rely on familiar fragility tropes.</comment>
