<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to explore houses and use the shard. Interiority is concrete, but some emotions like "quiet wonder" lack specific embodiment. The final realization is earned through her actions, with visible cost in her changed perspective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as Eli perceives the house's energy, under an accumulative/textural lens. Cost is legible in her "exhilarating and humbling" shift. Orientation is clear early, and causality holds from discovery to ritual.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sensory details like "sweet scent of blooming flowers" create vivid atmosphere, and the orris root shard charges the final image. However, the bay setting doesn't strongly constrain choices, leaning decorative in parts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes in understanding house energy escalate through Eli's agency with the shard, leading to a revelation. Cost is felt in her altered perception, under the accumulative lens, but escalation is gradual without sharp turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of hush and energy emerges through particulars like the shard and ritual, with subtext in the house's aliveness. Ending offers a non-literal answer without moralizing, though some abstractions like "palpable beauty" dilute resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a reflective, descriptive voice fitting Eli. Dialogue is natural but minimal. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is distinct, though prose can be overly poetic at times.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with good rhythm and density, but minor issues include slightly mixed metaphors like "hushed blaze" and occasional long sentences. No major loops or artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of concepts like the shard of hush and sanctification through displaced objects feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in mystical elements heightens stakes without gimmickry, supporting closure.</comment>
