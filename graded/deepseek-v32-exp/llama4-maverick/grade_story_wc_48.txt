<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied emotion; the novelist's internal conflict is concrete, and her decision to continue writing is earned through the apparition and shell symbolism. Micro-choices under pressure reveal her values, but the ghostly figure's role as subconscious manifestation slightly abstracts the motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost—her peace and renewed writing flow stem from accumulative texture. Orientation is clear early; the accumulative lens holds without contradiction, and the shell's reweighting charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is evocatively specific with mist and nexus, filtering through POV to mirror internal turmoil. The seashell fragment as micro-setting constrains choice by focusing her attention and charges the closure as a talisman, though spatial choreography is minimal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (creative block) escalates under accumulative lens through density increase from the apparition and shell realization. Protagonist agency in deciding to write forecloses fear with legible cost, but pressure relies heavily on internal shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from symbols and events without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer on creativity and hope. Subtext in the ghostly guide and shell deepens meaning, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively lyrical, with perceptual signature filtering details through the novelist's bias. Elision in the apparition is taught and paid off at closure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though slight overwriting in mystical descriptions doesn't harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar tropes (writer's block, guide) through specific, grounded details like the feral nexus and shell. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
