<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. Her role as an ash scatterer drives the climax, and her final action is earned by prior reflection. However, she leans slightly passive, with contemplation outweighing active conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative textural lens holds strongly; closure is a conceptual repricing with legible cost in the scattering ashes and realization of transience. Orientation is immediate, and the single-scene structure coheres without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail, and the gallery atmosphere supports theme. The mask and powder act as micro-settings that charge the final image, though the environment doesn't heavily constrain choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes around the mirage of safety escalate through Lena's pondering and interaction with Eli, culminating in her agential scattering act with visible cost. Under accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transience and safety as illusion emerges organically through images and events, with subtext in the mask and ashes. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature filtered through Lena's perspective. Dialogue is natural and advances plot, and prose rhythm controls pressure well.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density and varied sentence rhythm. No major loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle; closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept of an art ash scatterer is fresh and organic, with specific details transforming familiar tropes. Emotional truth and synthesis feel inevitable, supporting stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
