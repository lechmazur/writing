<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and drives the narrative, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses and genuine struggle under pressure, with emotions like "longing" and "solace" described abstractly rather than embodied in micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost in the completed tapestry transforming the labyrinth's meaning, anchored early and paid off at dawn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the labyrinth constraining choice and charging the final image; micro-setting elements like the workbench and fabric are integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes of transforming ruin to reverence escalate through Aria's weaving agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in her emotional journey and the tapestry's completion foreclosing despair.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hope emerges organically through the weaving metaphor and specific imagery, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, deepened by the storybook plate's reprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature; voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., sleepwalking paths) is taught and pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and propelled, but minor artifacts include repetitive phrasing like "hauntingly optimistic" and some synonym churn ("ruin to reverence"), though clarity at closure is unharmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes weaving and labyrinth tropes with fresh specificity; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes, and the transformation feels inevitable through character-driven choices.</comment>
