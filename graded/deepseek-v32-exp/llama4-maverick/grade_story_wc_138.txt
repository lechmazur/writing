<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's immortal boredom and dimensional awareness are consistently portrayed, with embodied emotions like "heart stirred with wonder and trepidation." The final choice to embrace transformation is earned by prior causality, though internal contradictions are underdeveloped in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost—the duplicate's statement "I am what remains after goodbye" reweights the premise, and the causal lens holds tightly from curiosity to spatial mutiny. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite constrains choice by amplifying energy and charges the final image as a "gateway to the infinite." Sensory details like "swirling colors" and "electric tension" are purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency in weaving magnetic fields, leading to the duplicate's emergence and a felt cost—the transformation from boredom to awe. The dominant stake (discovering afterlife) tightens under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the duplicate's revelation, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to "what happens after goodbye" without moralizing. The final image of stepping into the unknown reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by dimensional awareness. The duplicate's dialogue carries subtext, and prose rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with minor figurative density in peaks like "colors danced," but no loops or artifacts harm closure. Sentences advance story and atmosphere cohesively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes immortality and spatial mutiny with specificity, transforming tropes through Kael's dimensional awareness. The closure's conceptual repricing feels inevitable and risks heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
