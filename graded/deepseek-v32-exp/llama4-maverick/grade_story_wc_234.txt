<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character has clear motivation and interiority, but lacks internal conflict or flaws; change is earned through inspiration rather than struggle, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost under an accumulative lens; orientation is clear early, but causality is light and cost is mild.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details and POV filter; the nautilus shell as a micro-setting charges the final image, though the ember nexus is more atmospheric than constraining.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are internal and escalation is subtle under the accumulative lens; agency drives the revelation, but cost is not unmistakably dramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, supported by subtext like the secret phrase.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable POV with distinct perceptual signature and lyrical rhythm; voice is consistent and enhances the accumulative drive, though dialogue is minimal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and clear with high information density; no significant loops or artifacts, and rhythm supports the mood without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of science and romance with specific details; originality lies in the blend, but risk-taking is moderate and transformation is not fully groundbreaking.</comment>
