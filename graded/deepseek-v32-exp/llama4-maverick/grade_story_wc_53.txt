<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied actions like clutching the camera wheel. The final choice to take the photograph is a micro-choice that reveals values under pressure, earning the resolution. However, some abstraction in "negotiating with their own ghost" slightly limits depth, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Charged Poise as the scavenger takes the photograph, reconfiguring meaning with felt cost in the "measure of peace." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with fragments building to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon setting is vividly specific and constrains choices by being the environment where fragments are collected, charging the final image. Sensory details like "sound of the wheel's mechanism" are selective and purposeful, filtered through the scavenger's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by the scavenger's agency in collecting fragments, leading to a deepening that reweights the stake of understanding the past. Cost is legible in the regret and resolution, though the escalation is more gradual than tight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and regret emerges organically from fragments and the photograph, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in whispers and the final image, inviting reflection through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, reflected in rhythmic control like "clicks and whirrs" and perceptual signature. No head-hopping; elision in fragments is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with purposeful lyrical phrases. Minor potential overwriting in repeated "fractured stillness" does not obscure closure, and no major loops or artifacts harm momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of a kinetic lagoon and story scavenging is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specifics like the disposable camera wheel avoid template plots.</comment>
