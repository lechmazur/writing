<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's curiosity and meticulousness are consistently embodied, driving investigation and final resolve; interiority shows embodied emotion like "shiver run down her spine," but contradictory impulses under pressure are subtle rather than deeply layered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with clear linkage from message discovery to decision; closure lands as Charged Poise with cost legible in her determination and implied risk; orientation is anchored early, and persistent constraint (message tube) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sensory details like "rustle of leaves" and "silver glow" are vivid and POV-filtered; courtyard setting charges the final image by providing solace and clarity, though it doesn't heavily constrain choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from curiosity to exposing illicit experiments, driven by protagonist's agency in deciphering and deciding; cost is felt in caution and resolved purpose, under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of integrity in solitude emerges through particulars like her solitary work and discovery; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though subtext is occasionally straightforward.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm and diction reflect her introspective nature, but dialogue is absent and voice lacks high distinction under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and information density without loops or artifacts; sentences advance story and atmosphere, e.g., "darkness deepened, and the stars shone brighter," with clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Concept of storm recorder and rogue quarantine zone feels fresh and specific; synthesis is organic, though not highly transformative or risky, relying on grounded execution rather than innovation.</comment>
