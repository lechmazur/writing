<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, with interiority shown through sensory perception and micro-choices like tuning into radio frequencies. However, lacks internal contradiction or flaws, and emotions are sometimes abstract (e.g., "sense of calm wash over her") without embodied cost under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change (new dawn breaks, visionary's role affirmed) and felt cost (pride and transformation). Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages (e.g., listening leads to guiding prophet). Orientation is anchored early with who, where, when.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective ("stormlit observatory," "cobalt glass portico"), with sensory details that pressure choices (storm fuels mind, portico evolves to beacon). The portico constrains and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shaping new dawn) is signaled early and escalates through visionary's agency (listening, unfolding narrative). Cost is legible in her sustained effort and transformed world, but stakes remain somewhat abstract rather than viscerally felt in key beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme (using past for future) emerges through events and images (portico, radio frequencies) without direct moralizing. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer, but "ancient shadows" and "variant allegiance" lean toward abstract concept over concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with distinct lyrical prophetic voice. Perceptual signature is consistent (noticing through radio, portico), and elision (time jumps) is taught and pays off at closure. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and clarity, with good information density. Minor clichés ("sands of a desert") and abstract phrasing ("variant allegiance") occur but do not obscure causality or closure. No significant loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Premise feels fresh with non-obvious synthesis (visionary using radio to guide prophet). Lyrical tone with "gritty whimsy" accents heightens stakes, and specificity (observatory, portico) avoids template plots. However, transformation of tropes is moderate.</comment>
