<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Alchemist's motivation is clear and drives choices; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, though "stoically sensitive" leans slightly abstract. Final transformation is earned through causal process, with visible cost in the new path forged.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with decisive change and felt cost; causal lens holds strong from gathering fragments to transformation. Orientation is clear early, and no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with ember nexus pressuring choices; the broken crozier as a micro-setting object charges the final image by constraining the alchemist's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early; escalation is driven by alchemist's agency under causal lens, with cost legible in the transformation foreclosing the old path. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of creative destruction emerges through events and images, not statement; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and controlled under pressure, with no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control; minor overwriting like "frozen bloom" is purposeful and doesn't harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of creative destruction with alchemy feels inevitable; specific details and risk-taking in poetic style heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
