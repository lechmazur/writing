<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's guilt and motivation are clear, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Interior contradiction is shown in her unease versus professional duty, and the final resolve is earned by the memory trigger and prior causality. However, some emotional summary slightly abstracts state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with atmospheric buildup; closure is a Charged Poise as she resolves to uncover truth, with cost legible in "tempered regret" and burden of secrets. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraint of guilt shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (cobalt terrace, driftwood carvings) are selective and purposeful, constraining choice by triggering memory and charging the final image. Setting pressures decisions and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering truth escalates under Accumulative lens through memory formation and internal conflict; agency in her decision to continue drives escalation with cost felt in guilt. One meaningful tightening forecloses avoidance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of truth and guilt emerges through images like sieved hush and watch hand, with subtext in unease and memories. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though some abstraction lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct melancholic voice and perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., memory trigger) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical prose with varied rhythm and high information density; minor figurative density in peaks but no major loops or artifacts. Sentences advance story, though occasional purple phrasing slightly dulls clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis with black market genealogist and sieved hush concept; specific details like driftwood carvings transform tropes through grounded choices. Risk-taking in introspective style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
