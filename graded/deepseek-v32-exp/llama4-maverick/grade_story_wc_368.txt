<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in the donor heart, but lacks internal conflict or embodied emotion under pressure; final realization feels earned but without visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with accumulative lens held; cost is subtle but legible in the final clarity, though not deeply felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly atmospheric with sensory detail, but the tea house and wing do not constrain choices or charge the final image decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation occurs through Kaito's agency in illuminating the wing, but cost is weak and pressure remains mild under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the wing's patterns and Kaito's arc, offering a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, though somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctively contemplative with perceptual signature; no head-hopping or dialogue issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting like "valley-mist wonder" slightly muddles peak beats without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh with specific synthesis, but emotional complexity is limited and risks lean lyrical without transformative stakes.</comment>
