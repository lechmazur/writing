<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, with micro-choices under pressure, but some emotions like "inexplicable connection" lean toward diagnostic language rather than embodied specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strong with clear linkage from brooch discovery to closure; Conceptual Repricing lands with cost in the final image of the brooch glowing, reweighting the island's history.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like "rain trails" and "crumbling buildings," constraining choices and charging the final art piece; minor generic phrases like "perpetual gloom" prevent higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist's agency in following clues and exchanging art, with cost legible in the bartering unease and final weight of convergence; one meaningful tightening suffices under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of meaning through trauma emerges organically from brooch and convergence, with resonant non-literal answer in the art piece "Convergence"; no moralizing or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct painterly perception; dialogue with stranger feels natural and goal-driven, though minor register consistency issues in phrases like "wryly earnest."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and evocative with good rhythm, but minor overwriting in phrases like "wryly earnest sense of purpose" and slight figurative strain in "haggard awe" dampens peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting, artistic pursuit, and mystical convergence feels organic; specific details like amber brooch and rain trails avoid template plots, though not fully transformative.</comment>
