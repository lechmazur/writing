<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure, but the motivation to "discover the shape of collective grief" leans abstract and is more told than earned through contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (peace shifting grief); Accumulative lens holds via imagery buildup; orientation is clear early, and spectral mentor's appearance, while convenient, doesn't break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting vividly pressures choices and charges the final image with sensory detail (greenhouse, butterflies, lunar glow); environment constrains reflection and supports theme without generic clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens is driven by protagonist's agency (recitation, realization); cost is legible in grief's shift, but stakes remain internal without external pressure, limiting height.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (butterflies, ribbon, poem) without moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to grief, though some explicitness in "shape of collective grief" slightly reduces ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is clear, but minor register drift in phrases like "thundering calm" slightly jars under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic control and density with minimal artifacts; minor figurative muddle in "thundering calm" doesn't obscure closure, and no loops or scaffold issues harm momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of gravestone carving, spectral mentorship, and butterfly migration feels organic and non-obvious; risk-taking in quiet reflection heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
