<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in the adjuster's duty, with interiority shown through embodied emotion like "weight of their task settling upon them." However, internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, and phrases like "bruised awe" verge on diagnostic label-speak, reducing concrete embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the "burden of bruised awe," under the accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the hush pattern teaches escalation, but the lens dominance is slightly ambiguous past midpoint, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image—the lighthouse lantern room and broken puppet head shape tactics and resonate at closure. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like "glass pane amplified the hush," with micro-setting integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation occurs through density increase in the hush and the adjuster's agency, with cost legible in the "weight" felt. However, the stake tightening relies more on atmosphere than protagonist-driven turns, limiting peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of fragility and balance emerges organically from images like the cracked puppet head, with a non-literal answer in the lullaby's peace. Subtext operates through implication, but near-moralizing in "beauty and balance could be maintained" slightly reduces resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic rhythm, e.g., "across the hush of time's final ripple." Perceptual signature is consistent, but some register drift in phrases like "beautifully flawed fabric of existence" clashes with the adjuster's focused lexicon under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, but minor overwriting with abstract compounds like "bruised awe" and template cadence in "seemed to" phrases reduces clarity. No major artifacts harm closure, though.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar elements (clock adjuster, puppet) with fresh, specific details that feel inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric approach heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure integrates originality seamlessly.</comment>
