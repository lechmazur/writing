<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aria's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as unearthing the tessera and renaming the plaza. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, but interior contradiction is minimal, and some phrasing edges toward stock epiphany, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the contrast between past joy and present devastation, under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the renaming act redefines the plaza's essence with undeniable pressure, though the lens is slightly ambiguous before midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like the "glint of color" and "cracked stone pavement" filtering through Aria's POV. The plaza and tessera constrain choices and charge the final image, but minor over-reliance on visual sense prevents a top score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (reclaiming hope) escalate through Aria's agency under the Accumulative lens, from finding the tessera to the renaming act, with cost legible in the "weight of her mission." However, escalation is more thematic than causal, and the dominant stake lacks a tight, on-page test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of aberrant mercy and rebirth emerges organically through images and actions, with subtext in the tessera's reprise and the renaming. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though the concept "aberrant mercy" is occasionally stated rather than fully dramatized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctively poetic, with rhythmic control and perceptual specificity, such as Aria's notice of "light danced across its surface." No head-hopping, but some register drift in phrases like "warm coldness" slightly disrupts consistency under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentences and no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is purposeful, but minor overwriting in peaks (e.g., "a coldness that was not quite cold") causes slight muddle without harming closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic hope with unique elements like retrocognition and aberrant mercy feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes, but some familiarity in the rebirth arc limits ingenuity.</comment>
