<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tutor and student are well-characterized with clear motivations, embodied in actions like the student's sparkling eyes and the tutor's patient teaching. The student's desire to learn the language of old buildings is dramatized through dialogue, though it remains somewhat abstract. The final gift of the seal feels earned by their interaction, with cost in the student's realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the single-scene structure builds through dialogue and atmosphere to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure when the student takes the seal. Orientation is clear early, and causality holds from the interrogation to the recitation. The cost is legible in the student's shiver and the tutor's satisfaction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The rooftop garden and meteor shower are vividly described with sensory details like twinkling lights and blooming flowers, enhancing the magical atmosphere. However, the setting functions more decoratively than as a constraint on choices, though it charges the final image with the seal's glow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—the student's quest to understand secrets—escalates under the accumulative lens through the tutor's interrogation and ancient text recitation. Agency is shown in the student's whispered reply and the tutor's gift, with cost felt in the student's shifted perspective. No major reversals, but pressure tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of "agreed upon lies" and hidden knowledge emerge organically through the dialogue and imagery, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer with the seal as a symbol, reweighting prior material without stated thesis. Subtext in the meteor shower and seal deepens resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single POV (tutor's) is stable with a lyrical, consistent voice. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, advancing the plot through subtextual exchanges. The prose has a distinct texture, though some phrases like "weaving a spell" edge toward purple without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is smooth and evocative with varied rhythm and good information density. No major artifacts like loops or scaffold; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting in peaks (e.g., "weaving a spell") is voice-consistent and doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The concept of a dead language tutor and "language of old buildings" feels fresh and specific, synthesized with the "agreed upon lies" theme. Risks are moderate, with the rooftop setting and meteor shower enhancing originality without gimmickry. It avoids derivative templates through grounded character choices.</comment>
