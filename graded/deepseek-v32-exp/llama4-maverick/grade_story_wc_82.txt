<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kaito's motivation to transform grief is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied actions like polishing glass and folding cranes. Contradictory impulses of solace and torment act simultaneously, and the final release of the crane is earned by prior causality with visible cost. However, some emotional descriptions like "luminous torment" edge toward abstract labeling, slightly reducing concrete embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Kaito releases the crane and feels grief unfold, with cost legible in the "poignant and unutterable" beauty. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with patterns of light and grief intensifying. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of grief shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with floating islands and tea garden, sensory details filtered through Kaito's POV. The glass basilica and lanterns charge the final image, but the environment doesn't strongly constrain choices; it serves more as atmospheric backdrop. Proper-noun economy and spatial choreography are coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation occurs through density increase in emotional and imagistic patterns, driven by Kaito's agency in crafting and releasing the crane. The dominant stake of transforming grief tightens with a visible cost in the "luminous torment." However, the escalation is subtle and lacks a sharp turning point.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grief transformed through art emerges organically from particulars like lanterns and cranes, with subtext in gestures and images. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, as grief unfolds "like the petals of a lotus flower." No thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, perceptual signature in Kaito's observations, and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., dream recording) is taught and pays off in closure. Dialogue is absent, so not evaluated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting in phrases like "poignant and unutterable" and repetitive use of "luminous torment," but no major loops or artifacts that obscure clarity. Figurative language is consistent and legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of floating islands, dream recording, and grief transformation feels organic and inevitable, with specific details elevating familiar tropes. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure reweights prior material with authenticity.</comment>
