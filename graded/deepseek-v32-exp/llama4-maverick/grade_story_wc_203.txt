<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ezra's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her trait of seeing ghosts and driven by curiosity. Interiority is concrete, such as when she runs her fingers over the mainspring barrel, revealing character under pressure. The final choice to carry stories forward is earned, with visible cost in the "weightless burden," though some emotions are slightly told rather than fully embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as Ezra feels the "weightless burden," reconfiguring her purpose with felt cost. The lens holds throughout, with causality clear in her discoveries leading to the logbook. Orientation is anchored early, and the mainspring barrel acts as a key, shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with sensory details like the "fluorescent buzz" and dust patterns creating an eerie atmosphere. The abandoned circus ticket office pressures choices, and the mainspring barrel as a micro-setting constrains action and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, enhancing the narrative's texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering secrets escalates through Ezra's agency, such as analyzing dust to find the hidden compartment. Under the accumulative lens, density increases with each discovery, leading to a cost legible in the emotional burden. However, the escalation is somewhat quiet, lacking a sharp turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of hidden stories emerges organically from events and images, like the ghosts and logbook, without direct statement. Subtext operates through implication, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the "weightless burden." Avoids moralizing, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with a distinct lyrical voice that reflects Ezra's observational nature. Prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, and ghost interactions carry subtext. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, such as in the compressed discovery beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is evocative with good rhythm and sensory detail, but minor overwriting occurs, e.g., "weight of it settles upon Ezra, a weightless burden" has slight redundancy. Information density is high, and sentences advance story without major artifacts, though some phrases could be tighter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The combination of elevator repair and ghost-seeing is fresh and specific, transforming tropes through grounded details. Risk-taking in the quiet, atmospheric approach heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
