<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion in movements like "breathing slowed," but interior contradiction is underdeveloped; the "lucid unrest" feels stated rather than dramatized through simultaneous impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with the last knot undone and spirits dissipating, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration under the accumulative lens; cost is legible in the "accumulated silence" and peace, with the lens held consistently throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with prismatic walls and starlight, and the tapestry needle as a micro-setting object constrains choice and charges the final image, integrating sensory detail purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early, and escalation is driven by the restorer's agency in unraveling knots, each releasing whispers that deepen the silence; cost is felt in the "velvety stillness" that grounds the spirits.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of silence and restoration emerges organically from actions and images like the net and hush, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the "accumulated silence" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctively lyrical, with a perceptual signature focused on silence and light; no head-hopping, and elision (e.g., "lucid unrest") is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no major loops or scaffolds; minor overwriting in phrases like "interlaced hush" is consistent and purposeful, not obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Concept of a mask restorer in a prism sanctuary is fresh and organic, with the net unraveling method feeling inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
