<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority is present but motivation is abstract and told rather than shown through micro-choices; final realization feels unearned with no contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost under an accumulative lens; orientation is clear early, but persistent constraint shaping tactics is weak.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered; the yellow lantern glass as a recurring object charges the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes are internal and escalation occurs through accumulation, but protagonist agency is passive and does not drive tightening under the lens; cost is felt but not earned by active choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through symbols and subtext; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though it leans on abstract concepts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a perceptual signature; lyrical prose maintains rhythmic control under pressure, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose has high density but shows minor repetition (e.g., "flourishing stillness") and some overwriting; no severe loops, but clarity remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept of a cosmic janitor is fresh and synthesized with specificity; risk-taking in quiet narrative heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
