<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion in the meditative state, but lacks deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses; the final choice to release the crane is earned but the cost feels somewhat soft, reducing impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost under an Accumulative lens, and orientation is clear early; however, the cost is not deeply felt or tangible, limiting higher-band eligibility despite persistent constraint from silence mapping.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details are purposefully integrated, with the setting and crane's wing charging the final image; environment constrains choice indirectly by fueling the meditative energy, achieving exceptional specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early and escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens, but the cost remains abstract rather than visceral, preventing unmistakable impact despite coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and subtext, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the crane's journey; no moralizing, and complexity lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature; rhythmic control supports pressure, and any elision is taught and paid off, though minor register drift in phrases like "terrestrially cosmic" occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, but some overwriting (e.g., "terrestrially cosmic") and repetitive stems ("tranquil blaze") cause minor artifacts without obscuring closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept of mapping silence is fresh and synthesized organically; risk-taking in lyric design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
