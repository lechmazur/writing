<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aria's motivation to find the moment before deciding is clear and drives the narrative, with embodied emotions like "the weight of unspoken apologies" and an earned change at closure. However, interiority lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Aria stands at the threshold changed, with cost legible in "the weight of the unsent letters lifting." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through imagery to a cohesive end, and orientation is anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the mangrove labyrinth and luminescent fungi guiding Aria's choices and charging the final image of the windowpane reflection. Sensory details like "damp earth and decaying leaves" are filtered through her POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake in uncovering truth behind unsent letters escalates under the Accumulative lens through density increases (spirits' crescendo, entity manifestation) and Aria's agency in using the shard. Cost is unmistakable as emotions release and weight lifts, though escalation relies more on texture than causal tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken words and regret emerges organically from unsent letters and the evoked entity, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer in "the space where an apology waits unspoken." Subtext operates through imagery and silence, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature biased toward spirits and mist. Dialogue with the apparition is brief but goal-driven, and prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, though minor convergence in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No major loops or artifacts, but slight overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "swirling vortex" of spirits) near closure slightly dulls clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of cryptic medium, mangrove setting, and unsent letters, feeling organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
