<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses and relies on abstract belief statements rather than embodied conflict. The final success feels earned but without significant internal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the unfettering of the sculpted hush, delivering a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens; cost is legible in the "sense of peace and wonder," and orientation is anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details in the ice cavern create a purposeful atmosphere that charges the final image; the environment responds to Elian's song, though it doesn't directly constrain choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes around certifying wonder escalate through Elian's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost unmistakable in the climax; the dominant stake tightens meaningfully through her song.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of wonder as essential emerges organically through events and imagery, avoiding moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature; rhythmic control supports pressure without head-hopping, though no dialogue is present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative with strong rhythm, but slight overwriting in peak beats risks muddle; no major loops or artifacts, and propulsion remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, synthesizing synesthesia, art, and silence with specificity; risk-taking in lyrical design pays off with inevitable hindsight and emotional truth.</comment>
