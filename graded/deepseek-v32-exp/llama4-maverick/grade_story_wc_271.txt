<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Amira's trauma is embodied through concrete sensory details and micro-choices, such as her breathing slowing and shoulders easing, earning her final stillness. However, the "somatic markers" line introduces minor diagnostic speak, slightly reducing immersion. Her motivation to find solace drives the narrative coherently, with the photograph's smoothing providing a felt cost. Contradictory impulses are present but not deeply simultaneous, limiting the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Amira finds a "pearl of stillness," reconfiguring her trauma with legible cost in her heart healing. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory density to the final image. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality is maintained through environmental triggers. The abandoned lighthouse keeper backstory subtly tightens the stakes without breaking coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The arboretum setting charges the final image, with the twisted trees and cliff edge mirroring Amira's internal state and facilitating her change. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, such as the "blue-gray silk" sea and "creaking" trees, filtered through her POV. The environment constrains her choice by offering solace, directly shaping the closure. Economy is strong, with no generic placeholder elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of internal conflict between trauma and peace escalates under the Accumulative lens through density increase, as Amira's agency in standing at the cliff edge narrows options. Cost is legible in her healing and the photograph's transformation. However, escalation is subtle and reliant on environmental interaction rather than active pursuit, capping the score. No coincidental resolution undermines causality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of finding stillness after trauma emerges organically through images like the smoothing photograph and "pearl of stillness," offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gestures and symbols without moralizing. The final reconfiguration reweights prior material, but the concept of "anchoring optimism in realism" is slightly overt in statement, limiting the highest band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, as Amira's voice reflects her trauma through selective noticing (e.g., trees like "withered fingers"). Rhythm and syntax modulate with emotional intensity, though some phrases edge toward purple prose. No head-hopping or dialogue, and elision is purposeful. Experimental tolerance is maintained without clarity loss.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and information density, with sentences advancing character and atmosphere simultaneously. Minor overwriting occurs in metaphors like "pearl of stillness" and "blue-gray silk," but no loops or scaffold artifacts harm closure. Clarity and momentum are preserved, and the final image resonates without muddle. Read-aloud test passes with varied cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise of trauma recovery in nature is familiar but executed with specificity through the arboretum setting and photographic motif. Synthesis feels organic, with turns earned from character choice. However, it lacks high risk-taking or transformative originality, staying within conventional emotional arcs. Specificity in details like the lighthouse keeper adds freshness but not indispensability.</comment>
