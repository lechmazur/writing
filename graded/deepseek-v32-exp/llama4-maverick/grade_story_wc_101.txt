<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Akira's motivation is clear and consistent, with her gently persistent nature shown through actions like midnight food runs. However, interiority lacks concrete contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure; her determination feels stated rather than dramatized with flaws. The final endurance is earned but without deep internal conflict, limiting complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost from sanctions, under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and causality holds through Akira's leadership. The silver bell's reprise reinforces community solidarity, but the drive lens is simple without significant tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor and lanterns provide vivid sensory details, but the setting remains atmospheric without constraining choices or charging the final image. Sensory selection reflects calm urgency, yet it lacks tactile integration that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of community resilience is signaled early and escalates through Akira's agency under the accumulative lens. The declaration tightens options with visible cost, but conflict is internalized and lacks external pressure, limiting tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of solidarity emerges from events like donations and the bell, but subtext is occasionally explicit, as in "we will not be broken." The ending offers resonant hope without moralizing, yet it leans on declaration over earned nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with consistent perceptual signature, and dialogue is minimal but functional. Voice remains coherent under pressure, though it lacks distinct rhythmic control or experimental risk.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose has smooth rhythm and good information density, but minor repetitive phrasing ("soft chime," "gently persistent") creates light scaffold. No major artifacts obscure closure, yet density wanes in reflective moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Premise of exile community during sanctions is integrated organically but not highly original; elements like the bell and donations are synthesized without bold transformation. Specificity anchors universals, but lacks risk-taking ingenuity.</comment>
