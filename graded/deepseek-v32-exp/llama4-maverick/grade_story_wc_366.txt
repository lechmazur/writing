<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The skipper's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., picking up the sea glass, stacking stones) leading to an earned resolution to protect the lighthouse. The "luminescent ache" effectively conveys internal conflict, though some abstraction slightly limits peak emotional specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under the accumulative/textural lens, with cost legible in the final image of the glowing cairn and resolved ache. The anonymous letters introduce atmospheric pressure but are not fully integrated into the closure, causing a minor deduction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting vividly constrains choice (the dark lighthouse prompts action) and charges the final image (the cairn glows). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the skipper's POV, with the sea glass and stones acting as micro-settings that deepen resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is driven by the skipper's agency (stacking stones) and deepens the stake of safety vs. darkness, with cost felt in the luminescent ache. The cadence shift during the ritual meaningfully reweights options without requiring multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images (sea glass, stones, lighthouse) without moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to longing and safety. The final reconfiguration of the "luminescent ache" into peace avoids abstraction and arises from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively observant and lyrical, with rhythmic control under pressure (e.g., "the motion was meditative"). No head-hopping or register drift; elision in the letter chain is purposeful and paid off atmospherically.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language consistently enhancing mood (e.g., "glowed like a tiny, blue ember"). No loops or scaffolds; sentences advance story and character with clarity, though minor purple tinges exist.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse, sea glass, and stone stacking feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in the accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, but it lacks a groundbreaking twist.</comment>
