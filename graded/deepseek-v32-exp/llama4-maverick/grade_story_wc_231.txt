<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael's interiority is concrete and embodied, but his passive observation lacks micro-choices under pressure; the final gesture of retrieving the boutonnière is a small, earned renunciation, but it doesn't fully compel higher-stakes choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Kael retrieves the boutonnière, reconfiguring his connection to borrowed memories with felt cost; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the opal dock, mist, and lighthouse charging the final image; the lighthouse as a memory repository constrains Kael's perception and deepens the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, stakes escalate through Kael's observational agency, leading to a deepening realization of memory's burden; cost is legible when he feels the "weight of the memories."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of borrowed memories and isolation emerges organically through images and actions; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the boutonnière without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is atmospheric and consistent, with no head-hopping or register drift, supporting the textural drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and propulsive with high information density; minor repetition of "witnessed isolation" doesn't harm clarity or closure, and no major artifacts obscure cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept of borrowed memories is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet, accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
