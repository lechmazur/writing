<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is clear and intensifies, rooted in personal loss and obsession; her internal contradiction is shown when she realizes she's lying to herself, embodied in a "shiver run down her spine." Micro-choices under pressure, like digging deeper into the archive, reveal her values. The final transformation is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in her new perspective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost: the realization that files are archived, not deleted, reweights her understanding and transforms her worldview. The Causal lens holds tightly, with investigations leading step-by-step to discovery. Orientation is clear early, and the recurring numbers act as a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The digital archive setting is vividly described and constrains choices, serving as a micro-setting that pressures Lena's investigation. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, e.g., "dimly lit room" and "labyrinth of servers." The patch and numbers charge the final image, though other senses could be more developed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering the truth escalates through Lena's agency, driven by her obsession and the recurring numbers. Cost is unmistakable in her personal realization and transformation. Under the Causal lens, escalation tightens options, though the external conspiracy is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and loss emerges through events and images, with subtext in Lena's personal void. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: archived files reconfigure absence into possibility. No moralizing; wisdom arises from concrete experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, introspective voice reflective of Lena's professional mindset. Prose has rhythmic control and perceptual signature, e.g., "whispers of the past lingered." No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high information density and varied syntax, advancing story and character effectively. No significant loops or artifacts; figurative language like "ghostly signature" is purposeful. Momentum maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of corporate memory keeping with sci-fi mystery feels inevitable, transformed through specific details like the numbers and patch. Emotional truth in personal motivation elevates stakes. Risk-taking in genre blending pays off with coherence.</comment>
