<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Aria's motivation to honor overlooked histories is clear and consistent, but internal conflict and contradictory impulses are underdeveloped; her actions are reverent but lack micro-choices under pressure, making the characterization functional but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where peace settles, costing transience; orientation is clear early, but escalation is gentle, relying on texture rather than causal tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and selective, creating an ethereal atmosphere, but the grotto setting does not meaningfully constrain choices or charge the final image, limiting its impact on stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes around honoring histories are signaled but remain abstract; escalation under accumulative lens is mild, with agency in building structures, but cost is subtle and lacks dramatic pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of transience and memory emerges organically through images like the moth wing and temporary structures; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, enriching subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice; perceptual signature is clear through Aria's reverence, and elision is purposeful, though no dialogue is present to test naturalism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is lush but has overwriting, such as "blushing stillness" creating mixed metaphors; rhythm is varied, but some decorative language reduces clarity and momentum in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes nature meditation with ephemeral art, feeling fresh through specific details like the moth wing, but risk-taking is moderate and originality is somewhat familiar.</comment>
