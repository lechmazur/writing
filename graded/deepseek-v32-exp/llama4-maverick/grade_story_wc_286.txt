<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Akira's interiority is concrete and emotions are embodied, but lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle under pressure; final choice to take the glass is earned but passive, with minimal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost in temporal dislocation; accumulative lens holds, but fractured timelines remain abstract without shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory-rich, with the oasis and glass constraining choice by guiding Akira's actions and charging the final image; specificity supports theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes around understanding change escalate through accumulative density and Akira's agency in thrumming; cost is conceptual but legible in the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of kindness and resistance emerges organically through images and realization; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively poetic, with perceptual signature filtering details through Akira's zen mindset; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and dense, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffolds; figurative language is controlled, though "phototropic to kindness" risks slight purple hue.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of potter, oasis, and timelines feels organic; specific details and risk in abstract concepts heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
