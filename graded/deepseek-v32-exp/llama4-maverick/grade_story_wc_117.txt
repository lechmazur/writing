<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Aria's motivation is clear and consistent, but lacks internal conflict or flaws that complicate choices; her characterization is functional but idealized, with no contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) during the eclipse peak, cost legible in "cautious exuberance"; accumulative lens holds with density increase through sensory and emotional layers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospherically rich, but Sage Ridge does not constrain choices or charge the final image beyond mood enhancement, missing the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate meaningfully under the accumulative lens through the eclipse and adaptive music, with cost visible in the tempered joy; agency drives the connection, but escalation is gentle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of ordinary magic emerges organically from particulars like the curl and music, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though it leans slightly overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively lyrical, with a consistent perceptual signature; no dialogue present, but elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic with good information density, but minor overwriting (e.g., "hush of dreaming roots") slightly dulls momentum without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in a fresh synthesis of music therapy and celestial event, feeling inevitable in hindsight, but risk-taking is moderate and transformation of tropes is solid not groundbreaking.</comment>
