<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is clear and rooted in her background, with interiority showing contradictory impulses under pressure. The final choice to take a risk is earned by prior causality, such as her reflection on the ink pot reconfiguring her perspective. Embodied emotions like "surge of determination" avoid stock phrasing, though minor telling moments slightly reduce impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with cost legible in the risk of getting caught, under a causal lens that holds tightly. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and persistent constraints like the ink pot shape tactics. The "breach of protocol" decision arises from established causality without teleporting or amnesia.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid with sensory details like "sterile smell of formaldehyde" and the ink pot constrains choice by liquefying rigid thinking. The funeral home atmosphere charges the final image of "deathly vitality," and spatial choreography remains coherent, though deeper environmental pressure on choices could elevate further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of political asylum escalates meaningfully under the causal lens through the father's negotiation and the required breach. Protagonist agency drives escalation, with cost unmistakable in the risk of capture. However, the external conflict relies slightly on off-stage progress, limiting peak tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of "mathematics of a fair trade" emerges through concrete particulars like the ink pot and negotiation, offering a resonant, non-literal answer at closure. Subtext operates in silences and images, avoiding moralizing, though the concept is occasionally stated rather than fully implicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Lena's biased noticing and rhythmic prose under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though minimal. Purposeful elision, such as the ink pot's significance, is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language like "liquefy the rigid thinking" is coherent and voice-motivated. Minor register consistency in peak beats prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of con artists, political asylum, and funeral home setting, with the ink pot as a non-obvious guide. Tropes are transformed through specific choices, and risk-taking in the charged poise ending heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
