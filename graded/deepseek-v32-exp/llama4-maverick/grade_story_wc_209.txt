<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Luna's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to seek understanding, with embodied emotions and earned change in her art. However, lacks contradictory impulses in scene and no significant flaws complicate choices, limiting higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost in Luna's transformed art and peace; Accumulative lens holds through imagery buildup. Orientation is clear early, but causality is more reflective than tightly causal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the cathedral window charging the final image by etching into Luna's soul. Amber pavilion and autumn atmosphere are purposeful, but environment doesn't strongly constrain choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes in understanding night blooms escalate through Luna's agency under Accumulative lens, with cost legible in her art's shift. However, escalation is gentle and internal, lacking sharp tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events, with ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the world blooming alongside her. No moralizing; subtext in darkness and interconnection deepens reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature; no dialogue, but prose rhythm supports contemplative tone. Minor monotony in internal focus prevents higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high density and varied rhythm with purposeful figurative language like "umbral tenderness"; no loops or scaffold. Minor overwriting in peak beats doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of artist's quest with specific details feels inevitable; lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transforms familiar tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
