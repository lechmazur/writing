<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Aria's motivation is clear and rooted in curiosity, but interiority leans abstract at peaks; the final expansion of heart is earned through prior engagement with the pearl, though contradictory impulses lack simultaneous dramatization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost in Aria's peace and purpose, and orientation is clear early, but the seashell's introduction feels slightly late.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Crystal caves vividly pressure choices and charge the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, with the pearl and seashell acting as micro-settings that constrain Aria's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Aria's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in her emotional dissolution of barriers; stakes deepen through pearl engagement, but one dominant stake lacks sharp tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of connection emerges through particulars like the pearl's radiance without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Aria's internal shift, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice; prose rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping, and perceptual signature is consistent, though some phrases edge toward generality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and density with minor synonym churn (e.g., "latent radiance" repeated); no major artifacts obscure closure, and sentences advance momentum efficiently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of bunker inspector and mystical elements feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors universals.</comment>
