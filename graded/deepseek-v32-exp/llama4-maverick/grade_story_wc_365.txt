<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and drives the narrative, but interiority lacks deep contradictory impulses; the protagonist's determination is consistent but underdeveloped in peak beats. Her final change is earned, yet the cost feels more conceptual than viscerally embodied. The sensory map maker trait is integrated but could have constrained choices more directly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with legible cost in her altered understanding; the accumulative/textural lens holds through successive world shifts. Orientation is clear early, and causality is coherent with the shard guiding the journey. However, the cost, while present, lacks a deeply felt physical or emotional anchor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like "scent of rust and decay," and the green glass shard as a micro-setting object charges the final image. The repair bay and multiverse environments are filtered through the POV's sensory focus, influencing her journey. Spatial choreography remains clear despite transitions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering the withheld truth) is signaled early and escalates through the protagonist's agency in navigating worlds. Under the accumulative lens, density increases with each universe, leading to a revelation with conceptual cost. One meaningful tightening occurs as she presses on despite sensory overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through the quest for truth and the multiverse exploration, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via her clarified understanding. Subtext is present in the shard's symbolism and the cost of knowledge, but some ambiguity could be richer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature aligned to her mapping profession; voice is consistently poetic and dreamlike. No dialogue, so evaluation focuses on narrative control and elision, which is taught and paid off. Rhythm modulates with pressure, though slight uniformity in sentence structures appears.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is elegant and propulsive, with varied syntax and high information density; no major artifacts like loops or scaffold sentences. Figurative language, such as "like a reflection on rippling water," serves the atmosphere without muddle. Read-aloud rhythm is strong, and closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes sensory mapping with multiverse travel in a fresh, inevitable way; tropes are transformed through specific details like the green glass shard. Risk-taking in accumulative structure pays off with coherence. Emotional truth grounds the conceptual ambition, avoiding derivative patterns.</comment>
