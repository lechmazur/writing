<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority conveyed through embodied actions like singing and gazing. The poet's final endurance feels earned by prior causality, though her passivity slightly limits agency. The trait "shyly unstoppable" is demonstrated but could be more dynamically tested under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (weight lifting, reef-shadow joy) under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The galaxy postcard and shell environment coherently shape the ending's charge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting vividly constrains choice and charges the final image, with selective sensory details (bioluminescent fungi, shell interior) filtered through POV. The environment acts as a crucible, mirroring internal states and nurturing the poet's art, elevating specificity beyond ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by poet's agency in singing, reweighting stakes under the Accumulative lens with legible cost (centuries of longing). Dominant internal stake is signaled early and tightens through a meaningful cadence shift, though external conflict is minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images (postcard, armistice) without moralizing, offering a non-literal answer on art transcending sorrow. Subtext operates through implication, and the final image reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic diction and rhythmic control that reflects the poet's mind. Perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., centuries) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythm and purposeful figurative language. Minor overwriting exists but doesn't obscure closure; no significant loops or artifacts harm causality or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines through fresh synthesis (poet in mollusk shell, galaxy postcard) that feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style. Concepts are transformed through specific details, and the closure image recharges prior material without gimmickry.</comment>
