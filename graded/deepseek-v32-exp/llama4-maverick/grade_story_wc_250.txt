<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The guardian's motivation is abstract and told rather than dramatized through concrete choices; passive observation dominates, with no earned change or internal conflict under pressure. Key line: "to teach darkness the value of stars" remains a declared theme without on-page friction or cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with cost legible in the abandoned mirror and lingering silence; accumulative/textural lens holds through pattern density and cadence shift. Orientation is clear early, but causality is subtle under the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, but the cobalt dock setting functions atmospherically without constraining choices or charging the final image; the shutter pattern and mirror carry more weight. Micro-setting elements lack tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Escalation occurs through accumulative density in patterns and dialogue, but protagonist agency is weak; the guardian's passive response undermines driven stakes. Cost is felt in the abandonment but not tied to active choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of silent empathy emerges organically from images and gestures, with a resonant non-literal answer in the final stars; avoids moralizing. Subtext in patterns and silence enriches without exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively lyrical, with perceptual signature in the guardian's gaze; dialogue is minimal but natural. Elision and compression are taught and legible under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with varied syntax, but abstract terms like "silent empathy" and "spiralingly calm" occasionally dilute clarity; no major loops or artifacts harm momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of guardian, mirror, and shutter patterns feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet, accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details anchor universals.</comment>
