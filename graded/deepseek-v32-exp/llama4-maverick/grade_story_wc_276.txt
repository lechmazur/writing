<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The fisher's motivation is clear and consistent, with interiority shown through actions like transliterating emotions, but lacks internal contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure, making the characterization functional but not deeply flawed or complex.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens, as the fisher's connection to the goddess renews her spirit with felt cost; orientation is clear early, but causality relies on decorative elements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like "whispering grasses" and "sleepwalking constellations," and the garden constrains choices by enabling the voicing silence method, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early and escalate through the fisher's agency under the accumulative lens, such as zigzag walking and voicing silence, with cost legible in her renewed connection, but no major reversal narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence and connection emerges through events and images like the "silences between words," offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though it remains somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic rhythm, such as "feral lullaby," and perceptual signature is consistent; no head-hopping or elision issues, though dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, but some figurative language like "subtle chaos" feels overwritten in peaks; no major artifacts, though momentum occasionally drags.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of concepts like the sound wave garden and sleepwalking constellations, transforming familiar tropes through specific details and risk-taking lyrical style that heightens stakes.</comment>
