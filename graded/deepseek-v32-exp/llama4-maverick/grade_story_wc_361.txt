<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Eira's anxiety and purpose are consistent, but her "jittery" trait is more told than shown through embodied action; the pendant's vibration simplifies emotional complexity. The encounter with the woman earns a credible shift to peace, though the change relies slightly on external magic rather than internal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise with felt cost (Eira's peace and purpose), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory buildup. The ridgeway and encounter create a coherent reconfiguration, but the mystical woman's introduction feels slightly deus ex machina, lightly weakening causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail, and the pendant functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image. However, the setting doesn't strongly constrain choices; it primarily sets atmosphere without pressing tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, stakes escalate through the encounter's deepening of wonder and connection, driven by Eira's openness. The cost is legible in her renewed purpose, but the escalation is gentle without sharp tension or trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of finding magic in the routine emerges organically through the pendant and encounter, with subtext in gestures and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer, though the phrase "coax wonder from the routine" borders on explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and rhythmic control; sensory filtering reflects Eira's perspective. No dialogue, but elision (e.g., the woman's origins) is purposeful and supports mystery without clarity loss.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with varied syntax, but minor overwriting occurs (e.g., "germinating a sense of connection" feels slightly forced). No major artifacts; momentum remains strong through to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The relic courier premise offers a fresh synthesis of myth and mundane, with specific details elevating familiarity. Lyrical risk-taking coheres, though the mystical encounter leans on archetype without full transformation.</comment>
