<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The historian's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative, but internal conflict is underdeveloped; emotions like "anguished joy" are embodied but lack contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost ("forever changed") under a causal lens, and orientation is clear early; however, the method "avoiding patterns" is not deeply integrated into causality, slightly weakening the structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like "scent of aged parchment" create atmosphere, and the bronze prism pagoda as a micro-setting charges the final image, though the archive itself doesn't strongly constrain choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes in forbidden knowledge escalate through protagonist agency with the pagoda, and cost is legible as "anguished joy," but conflict remains internal without external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge and nostalgia emerges organically from events, with a resonant non-literal ending; however, some abstraction in "atoms of nostalgia" slightly limits depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, and dialogue is natural but minimal; voice is consistent though occasionally purple without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and rhythmic with good density, but minor overwriting in metaphors like "atoms of nostalgia" and slight register drift in peak beats cause small slips.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Premise offers freshness through specific details like the pagoda and atoms of nostalgia, transforming familiar tropes, but lacks high risk-taking or non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
