<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in Aria's role, but interiority lacks concrete embodiment and contradictory impulses; emotional states are described rather than felt, with no visible cost in her unification.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the universe restored, but the cost is implied rather than felt on-page, weakening impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly atmospheric with sensory details like "scent of aged parchment," but the temple library does not constrain choices or charge the final image beyond backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation occurs through Aria's journey, but under the Accumulative lens, deepening lacks driven agency and unmistakable cost, making pressure feel abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of unity and balance emerges organically without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of cosmic harmony restored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., "universe's hiccup") is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and rhythmic, but occasional overwriting (e.g., "words within seemed to dance") and decorative phrasing slightly dull propulsion; no major artifacts or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept of "spiral arbitration" and cosmic witness feels fresh and specific; synthesis is inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in structure heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
