<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and drives actions; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., chalk bringing "glimmer of purpose"). Micro-choices under pressure reveal values, and the final peace is earned through prior causality, though internal contradiction could be sharper.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the prophet feels the sound, not finds it, with cost legible in her "deep, abiding peace." Orientation is clear early, and the pattern teaches the journey.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (fog limits visibility, statues inspire affinity) and charges the final image; sensory details (e.g., "fog swirling," "crunch of gravel") are selective and POV-filtered, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing the sound) escalates through protagonist's agency (arranging driftwood) under accumulative lens; cost is felt in her emotional resolution, though the internal conflict lacks multiple tightening turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and time emerges through images (e.g., statues, videotapes) without moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("sound... to be felt") that reweights prior material with undeniable ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic rhythm ("tendrils curling like ethereal fingers"); perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., precognitive forgetfulness) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high density and varied rhythm without major artifacts; minor overwriting ("ethereal fingers") doesn't harm clarity, and closure image remains sharp with no loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of abstract concepts (e.g., sound of growing older) feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, and transformation through specific details (chalk, driftwood) avoids derivativeness.</comment>
