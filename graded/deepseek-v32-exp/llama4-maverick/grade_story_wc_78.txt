<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and drives actions, but lacks internal contradiction or visible cost in closure; prophet's singular focus feels one-note under pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (e.g., driftwood circle used for music) and charges the final image with vivid sensory detail; environment is integral to action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by prophet's agency under accumulative lens, with cost legible in exertion and lingering echo; stakes deepen meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of transforming obstacles emerges through concrete actions and final image without moralizing; subtext in music and atmosphere resonates.</comment>
