<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative, but lacks deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses; the closure feels earned but without significant embodied cost or flaw complication.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with clear orientation and on-page closure (Resonant Reconfiguration), but cost is mildly felt rather than sharply legible; escalation is straightforward but coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details and atmosphere create immersion, but the setting does not meaningfully constrain choices or charge the final image beyond backdrop function.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear, escalation driven by agency under causal lens, and cost is legible through exertion; however, pressure lacks high tension or complex trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through objects and actions, with resonant ending avoiding moralizing; but subtext remains somewhat abstract without deep integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical, consistent voice and perceptual signature; no dialogue, but prose rhythm supports pressure without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose has good density and rhythm, but "meteor hush" introduces a mixed metaphor, and minor repetition (e.g., "whispers") slightly dulls clarity; no major artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh synthesis of elements like telepathic plants and scar-reading; risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
