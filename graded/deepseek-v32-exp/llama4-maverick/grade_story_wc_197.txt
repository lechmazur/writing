<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Aria's motivation is clear and consistent, but internal conflict is more told than shown through embodied emotion; her resolve at closure is credible but lacks deep contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise under an Accumulative lens, with cost implied in the resistance; orientation is clear early, and structure coheres through the gathering and dispersal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The auric lagoon is vividly described but functions more as backdrop than a constraint on choices; sensory details are selective yet lack tactical impact on the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes against indifference escalate through Aria's reappearance and the gathering, but cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of preserving history emerges organically through symbols and actions; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a poetic, consistent voice; perceptual signature is strong, and elision (e.g., map origins) is taught and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is lush but has minor redundancy (e.g., repeated "otherworldly glow"); overall momentum is maintained with no major artifacts harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Concept of revised histories and the phone booth key offers a fresh synthesis; specificity in details avoids tropes, though not fully transformative.</comment>
