<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in observation, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses in scene; final action feels declarative rather than earned through deep struggle. The phrase "sculpt patience from impatience" trends toward diagnostic label-speak without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise under an accumulative/textural lens, with the viaduct's surge illuminating the lake, but cost is implied rather than felt on-page. Orientation is clear early, yet causality between moon tracking and revolution remains loosely associative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the frozen lake and viaduct charging the final image through their ethereal glow. The basalt sanctuary and viaduct's curves are purposefully detailed, but spatial choreography lacks tight pressure on choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early, and escalation builds through the viaduct's humming and moon tracking, but the revolution's start relies on magical resonance rather than protagonist-driven cost. Under accumulative lens, density increases without clear trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from moon paths and revolution imagery, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer in the mapper's peace. However, direct phrases like "patient revolution" edge toward theme statement without full subtextual integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively poetic, with a perceptual signature tied to the mapper's observations. No dialogue, but rhythmic control supports pressure; minor register drift in phrases like "restrained wildness" does not harm coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and dense, with varied syntax and strong sensory details, but overwriting creeps in with abstract lines like "sculpt patience from impatience." No major loops or artifacts, though momentum stalls in reflective moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise feels fresh and specific, synthesizing horizon mapping with revolutionary patience in a non-obvious way. Risk-taking in accumulative structure pays off with charged closure, though some elements rely on familiar archetypes.</comment>
