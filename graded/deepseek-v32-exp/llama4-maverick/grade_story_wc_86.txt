<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The negotiator's motivation is clear and rooted in thoughtful determination, with embodied emotion shown through actions like clutching the drawer pull. However, internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, slightly limiting depth. The final choice to untether the past feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the negotiator's peace and the parties' movement toward forgiveness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building tension through imagery and moon phases. Orientation is clear early, and the parapet's neutrality shapes the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The storm-worn parapet and mist create a vivid atmosphere that constrains choice by providing neutral territory, essential for the talks. The antique drawer pull recurs with reweighted meaning, charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the negotiator's agency under the Accumulative lens, using moon phases and her speech to deepen stakes. The cost is legible as parties move from stalemate to forgiveness. One meaningful tightening occurs through her "untethering" action, narrowing options with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of recycling mistakes into wisdom emerges organically through symbols like the drawer pull and moon phases, without moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer through the negotiator's felt peace, reweighting prior material with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in thoughtful observations and rhythmic prose. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven, carrying subtext in the negotiator's speech. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm, though minor overwriting appears in phrases like "furrowed hush." No significant loops or artifacts obscure causality; sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative build. Closure image remains clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of moon-phase synchronization and the drawer pull as symbolic balance feels fresh and inevitable, transforming familiar tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure effect is legible with conceptual cost.</comment>
