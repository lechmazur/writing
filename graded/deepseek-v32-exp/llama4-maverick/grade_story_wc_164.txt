<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion like "cheerful gloom." However, internal contradiction is underdeveloped, and the final realization feels earned but lacks deep struggle. Micro-choices under pressure, such as following seeds, reveal values, but the arc is more epiphanic than conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost in the understanding of flux, under an accumulative/textural lens that holds. The path reappears due to her guided actions, and orientation is clear early. Cost is legible in the final image of connection, though the lens is slightly ambiguous before midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the seeds leading deeper and crystals guiding her. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, charging the final image. The iridescent cave acts as a micro-setting that alters tactics and resonates at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake in discovering why paths disappear escalates under the accumulative lens through agency like following seeds and deciphering symbols. Cost is legible in her emotional shift and deepened connection. One meaningful tightening occurs, but the escalation relies more on discovery than active conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory and flux emerges through particulars like the crater glass and symbols, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext operates in images and implications, avoiding moralizing. However, the theme is somewhat abstract and lacks sharp counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature. Rhythm and diction control under pressure, such as in the transliterated hum. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off. The prose reflects the character's mindset coherently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with purposeful figurative language. Minor overwriting in phrases like "cheerful gloom" repeated, but no major artifacts or loops. Sentences advance story and atmosphere without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality is high with a unique synthesis of recollectionist, geode, and memory themes. The premise feels organic and transformed through specific details. Risk-taking in lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
