<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in character, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses and emotional embodiment is minimal; the final sense of purpose feels earned but without strong visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with implied conceptual cost under an accumulative lens; orientation is clear early, but cost is not deeply felt on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the tapestry as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image; details are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation is driven by the gardener's agency in decoding, but cost remains mild and conceptual under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end; subtext in the decoding process avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct with a poetic perceptual signature; no head-hopping and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with good rhythm and density, but minor figurative density in peaks doesn't harm clarity; no major loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels fresh and inevitable, with risk in the accumulative structure; transformation of tropes through specific details.</comment>
