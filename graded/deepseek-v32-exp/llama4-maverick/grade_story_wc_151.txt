<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Cipher's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied actions like transcribing codes, but lacks internal conflict or flaws, reducing depth; the final act of sending the letter is earned but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early; under an accumulative/textural lens, closure lands with Charged Poise as the letter's sending reconfigures meaning with cost in slowness; the drive lens holds without contradiction, though causality is minimal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and cohesive, with neon lights and chalk drawings enriching atmosphere, but it does not actively constrain choices or charge the final image beyond backdrop, limiting higher-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes around creating and discovering meaning are signaled early, and agency drives escalation under the accumulative lens, but conflict is absent and cost remains abstract rather than unmistakably felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in slowness emerges organically through images and events, with subtext in analog-digital tension; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though some statements are overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature; voice remains coherent under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., encoded messages) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffolds; sentences advance story and atmosphere seamlessly, and figurative language is coherent even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes surface mail nostalgia with encoding creativity in a non-obvious way; specific details like chalk drawings feel organic, and risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
