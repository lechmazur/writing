<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Protagonist's phobia-ridden nature and adaptive traits are clear, with interiority shown through embodied emotion like trembling hands. Motivation to prove vulnerability is power drives the arc, but some diagnostic self-awareness ("I was driven by a desire...") slightly undermines peak beats. The final choice to step out of shadows is earned through decryption, with visible cost in trembling certainty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages: discovery of betrayal leads to library search, decryption, and decisive change. Closure lands on-page with cost ("trembling certainty" and peace), orienting who, where, when early. No causality breaks; one meaningful tightening via note revelation reconfigures options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid with sensory details (rusted library, dim light, dusty shelves) and POV-filtered specificity. The library and seashell half charge the final image by enabling discovery, but environmental pressure on choices is moderate. Micro-setting (seashell) constrains tactics through decryption.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict between fear and vulnerability) escalates under causal lens via protagonist's agency in decryption. One meaningful tightening occurs with note revelation, narrowing options and forcing a trade-off with cost ("trembling certainty"). Stakes remain internal but viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability as power emerges through events and images (seashell, shadows), not just statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via "truth is in the shadows," but explicit moralizing ("to prove that vulnerability is power") in mid-beat reduces subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (introspective, crisis-narrowed perception). Voice coherence under pressure; no head-hopping. Experimental elements absent; prose texture supports rhythm, though some repetition ("firmly adaptive") occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose has good information density and rhythm, but minor artifacts include repetitive stems ("firmly adaptive") and a cliché ("trembling certainty"). No major loops or scaffold; clarity maintained in closure. Figurative language is purposeful but slightly overused in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing stunt double with phobias and betrayal, executed with specific details (seashell, library). Turns feel earned, but premise is not highly transformative. Risk-taking is moderate; closure reweights prior material without gimmickry.</comment>
