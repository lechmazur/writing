<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, with clear motivation rooted in loss, but the reaper's actions are more observational than decision-driven, lacking a decisive change with visible cost. The final peace feels earned but underplays contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost in "melancholy longing" and the atlas page's whisper. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, though causality is light.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, charging the final image with the atlas page and observatory atmosphere, but it does not meaningfully constrain choices or alter tactics, capping the score below the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation occurs through the density of crystallization, driven by the reaper's agency to name fears, with legible cost in the melancholic peace. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice emerges organically through images and echoes, with a resonant, non-literal answer in the final whisper and connection to mariners. No moralizing; subtext operates in implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature, though no dialogue is present. Elision in echoes is taught and paid off, with coherent distance control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats like crystallization, maintaining momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes reaper mythology with emotional depth in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming tropes through specific details like the atlas page. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
