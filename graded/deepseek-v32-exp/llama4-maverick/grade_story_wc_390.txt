<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Azure Coat's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "logically emotional" trait is stated rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. Her competence is unwavering, lacking genuine struggle or flaws that complicate choices, though her micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with clear orientation and closure in Earned Stasis; the artifact's harmonization resolves the mission with felt cost in Azure Coat's satisfaction. However, the plot is straightforward without significant tightening or persistent constraints shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail, such as the ice creaking and golden light, which constrains choice by influencing the resonance matching. The drift-ice marina charges the final image through its integral role in the vibrational alignment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through Azure Coat's agency in aligning the artifact, with cost legible in her emotional fulfillment. Under the causal lens, pressure coheres but lacks a major reversal or deepening that forecloses options with higher cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of sonic absolution emerges organically through events and images, avoiding direct statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with Azure Coat's peace reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in the ethereal atmosphere and sensory details.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, filtered through Azure Coat's professional and emotional priorities. Prose rhythm and diction are controlled, though no dialogue is present to test character voice distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush and propulsive but slightly overwritten, with minor artifacts like the mixed metaphor "fleshly ethereal atmosphere." Information density is high, and sentence-level rhythm supports scene needs without major loops or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse engineering, sonic absolution, and cryptographic elements feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the poetic style. Specific details like vibrational matching and the drift-ice marina avoid template plots, enhancing stakes.</comment>
