<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear but told rather than embodied; lacks internal contradiction or micro-choices under pressure, reducing depth. The final choice to create art is earned but without strong felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) and cost legible in "volcanic tenderness"; Accumulative lens holds through motif patterns. Orientation is clear early, and causality is coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (e.g., "aged parchment," "flickering fluorescent lights") are purposeful; the archive and tapestry fragment constrain choices and charge the final image, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation is driven by Elian's agency under the Accumulative lens, with cost felt in the emotional weight of the revelation. However, conflict lacks high tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of art's power emerges organically through motifs and the ending's resonant image without moralizing; subtext in the vandalism and message enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature, but some purple prose (e.g., "volcanic tenderness") slightly undermines voice consistency. No dialogue present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose has good rhythm and density, but minor overwriting and mixed metaphors (e.g., "volcanic tenderness") create slight muddle without harming closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Premise of a lending library arsonist in an archive is fresh and synthesized organically; emotional truth elevates it, though risk-taking is moderate.</comment>
