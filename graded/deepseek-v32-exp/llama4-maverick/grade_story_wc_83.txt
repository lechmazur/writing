<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Amira's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, with embodied emotion in key beats like clutching the crystal. However, her emotional progression from numbness to determination feels somewhat tidy and rushed, lacking deeper internal contradiction under pressure. Dr. Patel applies secondary pressure, but Amira's choices, while compelling, could benefit from more nuanced micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The causal drive lens holds strong, with the drone strike inciting Amira's awakening and leading logically to the observatory and data analysis. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the revelation about unused potential as a catalyst reweights the premise, with cost legible in Amira's "tempered" spirit. Some transitions, like the immediate shift to the Floating Observatory, are smooth but don't break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Settings are vivid and selective, from the wreckage's sensory details to the observatory's hum, with the geode crystal functioning as a micro-setting that constrains choices by sharpening focus and charging the final image. The environment actively shapes tactics, such as using the observatory's isolation for analysis, avoiding generic placeholder description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Amira's agency under the causal lens, as her hunt for answers intensifies through data analysis, leading to the revelation that unused potential is a catalyst. Cost is legible in her "determination" and the crystal's vibration, narrowing options and foreclosing paths. However, the stakes could be more viscerally felt in middle beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, such as awakening and unused potential, with subtext in the crystal's guidance. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Amira's purpose rising from destruction, avoiding moralizing. Some thematic elements, like "unfiltered awakening," are echoed but could be more deeply integrated into every beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct bleak tone, and dialogue is natural but minimal. The voice maintains coherence under pressure, though perceptual signature could be sharper in peak beats. No head-hopping or register drift, but some phrasing, like "intangibly tangible," risks slight repetition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose has good information density and propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms. However, minor artifacts include repetitive stems ("geode crystal clutched") and template cadence in descriptive passages, though they don't obscure closure. No major figurative muddle, but overwriting checks reveal some decorative mentions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements like drone strike trauma and perturbation theory feels fresh and organic, transforming tropes through specific choices in character and stakes. Risk-taking in blending emotional arc with sci-fi concepts heightens coherence, though it doesn't fully escape familiarity in the "hunt" narrative. Originality is evident but not groundbreaking.</comment>
