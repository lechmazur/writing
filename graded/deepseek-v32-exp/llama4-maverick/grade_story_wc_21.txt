<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Naomi's motivation is clear and drives the plot, but interiority lacks embodied contradiction; emotions like "inexplicable connection" feel abstract rather than concretely felt under pressure. The parley with Ada is a key micro-choice, but Naomi's emotional arc remains somewhat passive, with limited internal conflict or degradation under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration through Naomi's deepened understanding, with the causal lens holding strong via diary revelations and parley. However, the cost is implied rather than viscerally felt on-page, weakening impact; orientation is clear early, but the ending lacks a decisive change with tangible consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly atmospheric with sensory details like "scent of aged paper" and "obsidian lagoon," but it functions more as backdrop than a constraint on choices; the library and lagoon charge the final image but do not actively pressure tactics or alter options in key beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes in uncovering truth escalate through the parley, driven by Naomi's agency under the causal lens, narrowing options via decoded diary secrets. However, cost remains conceptual rather than visible, with no tangible loss or trade-off dramatized on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through memory and truth, with subtext in Ada's debris messages and the lagoon's symbolism; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though it leans slightly toward abstraction over concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic rhythm and perceptual bias in Naomi's observations; dialogue in the parley feels natural and goal-driven, though minor register consistency issues arise in phrases like "searing reverie."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is fluid with varied syntax and good information density, but slight overwriting in metaphors like "searing reverie" creates minor figurative muddle; no major loops or artifacts, and propulsion remains strong through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the zeppelin library and retrocognitive elements, synthesized cohesively; the premise feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight, though it doesn't take bold risks that heighten stakes beyond the established pattern.</comment>
