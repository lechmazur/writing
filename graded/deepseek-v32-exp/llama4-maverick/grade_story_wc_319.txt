<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Guardian's motivation is clear and consistent, with interiority showing melancholy and homesickness. Change to peace is earned through interiorization, but some abstract phrasing like "dimensional homesickness" slightly weakens embodiment. Micro-choices under pressure are present, such as visualizing the labyrinth, revealing hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with density build through mist and imagery. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in "weight of her responsibility had been lifted." Orientation is clear early, and pattern is taught, but closure feels slightly sudden, lacking deeper causal tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "frost-rimed paths" and "decaying leaves," filtering through POV. The frozen garden and mist constrain choice by shaping her interior journey and charge the final image with "statues serene and enigmatic." Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of overcoming homesickness and responsibility escalates under accumulative lens through density increase in mist and internal struggle. Agency in interiorizing exteriors drives deepening, with cost visible in lifted weight. One meaningful tightening occurs as she gains clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of uncertainty and boundaries of light emerges through images and events, not statement. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer with pendant as key and mist clearing, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in whispers and pendant glow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, mist-filtered prose. Voice is consistent and modulates with emotional intensity, e.g., "foggy lucidity." No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and taught, supporting closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and high information density, advancing story through concrete imagery. Minor overwriting in phrases like "foggy lucidity" but no major loops or artifacts. Closure image is clear with "pendant glowed softly," propelling momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of feral guardian, dimensional homesickness, and frozen library feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific details like cultist's pendant. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, supporting closure.</comment>
