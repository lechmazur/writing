<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies, but interior contradiction is underdeveloped; emotions are embodied in parts, yet the shift from orchard to labyrinth lacks deep internal conflict. The final choice is earned through causality, but cost feels somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (labyrinth reactivation) and felt cost (urgency before night frost); causal lens holds strong with logical linkages from nut to blueprint to assembly. Orientation is clear early, and no major causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting vividly constrains choices (night frost deadline, mechanical birds) and charges the final image (glowing path); sensory details are selective and purposeful, integrated with action. The labyrinth and cottage are micro-settings that alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under causal lens (assembling components, marking stones); cost is legible in urgency and risk. Stakes shift from orchard to travelers, but converge at closure with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of hope and guidance emerges from events without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the glowing nut and reactivated labyrinth. Subtext operates in symbols, but depth is moderate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice consistent, with a perceptual signature in the caretaker's observations; no head-hopping. Prose is clear but lacks distinctive rhythmic control under pressure, and dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose has good information density and variation in rhythm; no major loops or artifacts. Sentences advance story efficiently, though minor overwriting exists (e.g., "complex pattern" of wings) without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in fresh synthesis of cursed orchard, mechanical birds, and labyrinth; tropes are transformed through specific details. Risk-taking in blending elements heightens stakes, but some familiarity remains.</comment>
