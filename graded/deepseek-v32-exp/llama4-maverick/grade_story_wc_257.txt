<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with interiority shown through crafting actions. However, some emotions like "turmoil within" lean toward abstract therapy-speak, and the change, while earned, lacks strong contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in the character's renewed purpose. The accumulative/textural lens holds through gradual illumination of the curtains, though the origami method feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like sandalwood and starlight, and the observatory constrains choice by providing celestial resources. The curtains charge the final image with otherworldly energy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes of personal healing escalate under the accumulative lens through the protagonist's agency in aligning stars. Cost is legible in the transformation of grief, but escalation is gentle without sharp turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in desolation emerges organically from crafting and curtain illumination, with subtext in the tattoo stencil. The ending offers a non-literal answer without moralizing, though some phrases like "teach withering to bloom" edge toward explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct with poetic rhythm, reflecting the character's perceptual bias. No dialogue, but elision (e.g., origami mechanics) is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and density, but minor purple prose in peaks (e.g., "rippled with an otherworldly energy") and abstract language slightly muddles clarity. No major loops or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes jewelry making, celestial magic, and grief healing with specificity. The combination feels organic and inevitable, though it echoes common transformation tropes without full subversion.</comment>
