<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Aria's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her complex relationship with fire and compassion. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotions, such as her heart sinking at the charred tree. The final choice to continue healing scars is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her emotional scars. However, some moments lean toward told rather than shown, slightly reducing impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with Aria finding peace and purpose, cost legible in her determination and the final image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through reflection and imagery. Orientation is clear early, and causality links the radio call to grafting and resolution. Minor ellipsis in transitions slightly softens tightness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "kelp-drift peace" and "sweet scent of wet earth" filtered through Aria's POV. The black sand as a recurring object charges the final image by stirring in her pouch, constraining choice through its healing symbolism. Economy and selectivity strengthen atmosphere without clutter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of healing scars escalates through Aria's agency in grafting the tree, narrowing options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable in her emotional surge and the tree's renewal. However, escalation is somewhat gentle, lacking sharp tension, which limits peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events like grafting and the black sand, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to healing scars. Subtext operates through images and actions, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material without statement, though occasional explicit echoes like "scars can sing" slightly reduce subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct poetic voice, reflecting Aria's professional and personal perceptions. Rhythm and diction control under pressure, such as in the grafting scene. Dialogue is minimal but natural; no head-hopping or register drift issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and clarity, with high information density and varied syntax. No major loops or artifacts, though minor overwriting like "kelp-drift peace" may slightly blur sense. Propulsion is maintained, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Premise of arsonist's daughter firefighter offers a fresh synthesis, transformed through specific details like grafting and black sand. Emotional truth and risk-taking in quiet resolution heighten stakes without gimmickry. Inevitability in hindsight from character-driven choices.</comment>
