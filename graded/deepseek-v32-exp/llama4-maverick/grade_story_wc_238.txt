<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. However, the depth of internal contradiction is somewhat limited, and the resolution, while earned, lacks profound cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost in the orchard imagery, and the causal lens holds. But the induced currents method feels slightly vague, weakening causality at the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory detail, and the archive and orchard charge the final image. However, some descriptions border on overwriting, slightly diluting purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear, and escalation is driven by Lyra's agency under the causal lens, with cost legible in the orchard's destruction. Yet the pressure remains gentle, lacking sharp turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect miracles emerges organically through events and images, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Minor explicit mentions slightly reduce subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. No head-hopping or register shifts, though dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is evocative but has minor overwriting and purple patches (e.g., "forgotten melodies"). Information density is high, but figurative language occasionally muddles clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Combination of elements feels fresh and specific, with a non-obvious synthesis. However, it doesn't fully transcend familiar mystical tropes, and risk-taking is moderate.</comment>
