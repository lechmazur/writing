<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. The final transformation is earned through prior causality, with visible cost as she sheds her past. However, the "combative tenderness" descriptor feels slightly abstract, not fully dramatized in micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Kael realizes the disappearing island is a state of being, with felt cost in shedding her past. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory density to the final image. Orientation is clear early, and causality remains intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the sublittoral fringe and sea constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Kael's POV, integrating into action. The scrimshaw and whale's call act as micro-settings that deepen stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the Accumulative lens, as the whale's call prompts her to swim, narrowing options and leading to transformation. Cost is legible in the shedding of her past. The dominant stake of freedom is signaled early and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of freedom and self-discovery emerges organically from events and images, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext operates through implication, such as the scrimshaw's glow, avoiding moralizing. The final reconfiguration reweights prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic and consistent, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, such as the transition into the water, taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and clear propulsion, though minor overwriting occurs (e.g., "combative tenderness" feels slightly forced). No major artifacts or loops; sentence-level rhythm supports the accumulative design. Closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh synthesis of transformation through specific details like the scrimshaw and whale call, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
