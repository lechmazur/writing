<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in tradition, but interiority lacks concrete embodiment; emotions like "shadowed elation" feel abstract rather than physically felt. The herald's joyful determination is consistent but misses contradictory impulses under pressure. Micro-choices with the lantern reveal values, but no internal conflict diminishes depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in her "weight of responsibility." Accumulative/textural lens holds through patterned descriptions of light and shadow. Orientation is clear early, and structure is a single scene with coherent progression to dawn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful; the emerald lighthouse and glass lantern constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details (e.g., "beam slicing through darkness") are selective and filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere without generic clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens occurs through her lantern adjustments, deepening stakes as dawn coalesces. Protagonist agency drives the tension, with cost visible in her renewed purpose. One meaningful tightening suffices, though conflict remains internalized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from rituals and light/shadow imagery, offering a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext in actions like "steering the dawn" enriches complexity, and the ending reweights tradition's power without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic rhythm; perceptual signature shines in descriptions like "stars twinkled in rhythm." No head-hopping; elision (e.g., ancient traditions) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; sentences advance story without loops or scaffolding. Minor overwriting ("shadowed elation") doesn't obscure closure, and figurative language coheres with the tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes ancient rituals and modern decay uniquely; specific details (e.g., total internal reflection) feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional truth avoids cliché.</comment>
