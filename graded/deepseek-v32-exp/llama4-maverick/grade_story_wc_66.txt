<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Emilia's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion in her diligent actions, but lacks deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses under pressure, reducing complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the calm and anticipation; accumulative lens holds through sensory buildup, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the ember alcove and radio glow constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details are purposeful and integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens occurs through the broadcast discovery and dust response, driven by Emilia's agency; cost is legible in her satisfaction and the narrative possibilities unlocked.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of storytelling and magic emerges organically from particulars; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, supported by subtext in dust and music.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; lyrical prose reflects Emilia's mindset, and elision (e.g., mist) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is generally elegant with good rhythm, but minor artifacts include repetitive "thistled calm" and some synonym churn, though clarity remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept of teaching dust via pirate broadcasts is fresh and specific, synthesizing magical realism with narrative obsession; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
