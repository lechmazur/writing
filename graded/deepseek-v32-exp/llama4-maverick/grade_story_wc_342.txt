<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation to mirror the sky is clear and dramatized through reverent crafting, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses under pressure, and emotional depth feels abstract rather than embodied in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the artist captures the infinite and departs, with cost legible in the transience; Accumulative lens holds through pattern buildup. No causality breaks, and orientation is anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting vividly pressures choices via impending demolition and charges the final image; sensory details like "musty silence" and "dappled shadows" are selective and POV-filtered, constraining tactics through the live clock.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing essence before demolition) escalates under Accumulative lens through time pressure and coin discovery; agency in crafting the portrait forecloses options with felt cost, though escalation is subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of limits and transience emerges through events like the coin's message and the portrait's creation, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext in the "futility of seeking the infinite."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., coin decoding) is taught and paid off; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density, but minor overwriting (e.g., "fractally precise") and occasional dense phrasing slightly slow momentum; no major artifacts, and closure clarity is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes face-blind artist and condemned library with organic specificity; turns feel earned, and risk-taking in quiet tone heightens stakes without gimmickry; transformation of familiar themes is fresh.</comment>
