<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to uncover the truth and merge timelines is clear and drives the narrative, with interiority shown through her actions and thoughts. However, traits like "resiliently positive" are at times told rather than embodied, and the final choice, while earned, lacks deep contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure is achieved with Elara stepping into the unknown, a charged poise reconfiguring options with cost felt in her trepidation. The causal lens holds, but the revelation about the ferry's connection to time feels slightly abrupt, weakening causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly described with sensory details like the starlit grotto and humming air, constraining choices as Elara deciphers symbols. However, some descriptions edge toward purple prose, slightly diluting impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes around uncovering the vanishing ferry and cosmic balance escalate through Elara's discovery of markings, driven by her agency. Cost is legible in her wonder and trepidation, but the cosmic scale lacks personal immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of time and exploration emerge organically through events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer in Elara's step into the unknown. No moralizing, but abstraction slightly limits depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice, and dialogue feels natural. However, occasional register drift into ornate language undermines consistency under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally rhythmic and vivid, but overwriting issues like "permanent transient-ness" and repetitive phrasing ("spectral grotto") create minor artifacts, though clarity remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of merging timelines and vanishing ferries is fresh and synthesized with character-driven choices, avoiding clichés. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes, though it echoes familiar fantasy elements.</comment>
