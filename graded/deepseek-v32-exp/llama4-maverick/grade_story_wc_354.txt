<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and emotions embodied, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene; final renunciation feels earned through reflection rather than intense pressure, though cost is visible in exile.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in hopeful melancholy; Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; orientation is clear early, and causality is intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and selective, but the magnetic nexus functions more as atmosphere than a constraint on choices; it does not charge the final image decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative lens, escalation through reflection deepens stakes; agency in renunciation forecloses paths with cost, but pressure lacks sharp tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like silence translation; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though some abstraction lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm and diction are controlled, but minor repetition in phrasing slightly dulls pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose has good rhythm and density, but paraphrase loops (e.g., "translate silence" reiterated) and minor scaffold sentences reduce clarity; no major artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of exile, chess, and mystical elements feels organic; emotional specificity avoids tropes, but risk-taking is moderate, lacking bold structural innovation.</comment>
