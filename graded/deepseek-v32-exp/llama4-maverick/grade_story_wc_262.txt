<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority lacks concrete embodiment and contradictory impulses; the final understanding feels earned but without visible cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost (love lifting), and the accumulative lens holds; orientation is clear early, and the film strip acts as a persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, with the projection booth and film strip charging the final image; however, the setting does not heavily constrain choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clear, escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency in psychometry, and cost is legible in the emotional weight and resolution; fits the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events, with subtext in the goodbye letters; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptive signature; no dialogue, but prose rhythm and diction support the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and dense, with no loops or scaffolds; figurative language is controlled and supports momentum without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and synthesized with specificity, risking a vision sequence that heightens stakes without gimmickry; feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
