<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maria's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with concrete interiority shown through her observations. However, some emotional summaries like "her thoughts were consumed" lack full dramatization, and contradictory impulses are not strongly enacted in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as grief lifts and purpose emerges, under the accumulative/textural lens. The chrysalis and river foam patterns build to a resonant reconfiguration, with persistent constraints shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the braided ravine and chrysalis constraining choice by inspiring Maria's insight and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into her POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maria's agency under the accumulative lens, as her contemplation deepens into insight, foreclosing grief with visible cost. The stake is internal but coherently tightens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from metaphors like the chrysalis and river foam, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to separation and connection without moralizing. The ending image reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature blending scientific and musical elements. No dialogue, but voice remains coherent under pressure, though minor elision occurs without payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and clarity, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though phrases like "symphonically minded ears" slightly strain register.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality lies in the specific synthesis of polymer chemistry, grief, and natural metaphors, feeling inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
