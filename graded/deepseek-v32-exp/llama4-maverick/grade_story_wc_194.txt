<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Protagonist is passive with abstract motivation; lacks embodied emotion and internal conflict; final understanding feels unearned without visible cost or struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure with conceptual repricing and cost ("their dynasty would be the last"), but causality is mystical and passive, reducing drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details and atmosphere enrich the scene, but setting does not constrain choices or charge the final image sufficiently for higher band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes are abstract; escalation relies on external visions rather than protagonist agency; cost is implied but not visceral or driven by active choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of intuition emerges through imagery and subtext, but direct statements like "testament to the power of intuition" reduce subtlety and resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable POV with poetic, distinct voice; no head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent, though some florid phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose has good rhythm and density; minor overwriting in peaks (e.g., "bridge of intuition") but does not harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Premise is unique and synthesizes elements organically; fresh angle on intuition and revelation, though some elements feel replaceable.</comment>
