<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Asa's motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority lacks deep contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure. Micro-choices like reactivating the clock reveal values, but the dreamless trait isn't exploited for conflict, limiting complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as Asa merges with the dune and re-solidifies, costing her individual form but achieving peace. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pattern intensification, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposeful, with the dune and chess clock constraining choices (e.g., reactivating the clock alters the bloom) and charging the final image. Specificity avoids cliché, integrating environment with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes in cultivating sparks escalate under Accumulative lens through Asa's agency (e.g., channeling archive energy), narrowing options with cost legible in her merging. Pressure coheres but lacks mid-beat friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of rebirth from ashes emerges through images like the clock's rebirth and dune's glow, offering a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in "fractured lullaby" deepens resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic perceptual signature filtered through Asa's observations. Voice remains consistent under pressure, though diction is occasionally elevated for the character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is evocative with varied rhythm and clear propulsion, but dense figurative language risks overwriting in peaks like "kaleidoscope of color." No major loops or artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic elements feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the merging concept heightening stakes. Specificity in archive and dune avoids derivative traps.</comment>
