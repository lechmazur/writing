<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Aria's motivation is clear and internally conflicted, driving the narrative with embodied emotion in key moments, though some interiority leans abstract (e.g., "turmoil within her") without concrete contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Aria's sorrow and resistance, under a consistent accumulative lens; the threshold of stillness acts as a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposeful, integrating with character action and charging the final image, though it does not heavily constrain choices beyond atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Aria's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in her emotional journey and final peace, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of beauty and transcendence emerges organically through image and event, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable, lyrical POV with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping, and purposeful elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with varied rhythm, but occasional overwriting (e.g., stacked metaphors in peak beats) slightly obscures clarity without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of concepts (beautician mortician, skyborne grotto) feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyricism heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
