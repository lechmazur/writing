<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, with the protagonist's grim optimism driving endurance. However, motivation to "capture the texture of a missed opportunity" remains abstract, told rather than fully dramatized through choices, weakening causal pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the acceptance of being "forever bound." Cost is legible in the final image, and orientation is clear early, but causal linkages are subtle under this lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the infinite staircase constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory details like "dim light" and "thickened air" are purposeful and filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes are internal and dominant early, with escalation under accumulative lens through density increase in the climb and dice rolls. However, agency in endurance lacks a sharp tightening or trade-off, muting cost clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Themes of perpetual motion and chance are woven through particulars like the dice, with a non-literal, resonant ending that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext in the dice as symbols of chaos enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a philosophical voice that reflects the character's mindset. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent, though dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative but purposeful, with varied rhythm and no major artifacts. Some overwriting risks in peaks (e.g., "the air thickened with the weight"), but clarity and momentum are maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes infinite staircase, dice, and perpetual motion in a fresh, non-obvious way. Risk-taking in accumulative structure pays off with coherence, though it leans on familiar metaphysical tropes.</comment>
