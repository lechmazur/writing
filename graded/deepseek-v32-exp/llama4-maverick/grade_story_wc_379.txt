<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Emilia's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the investigation, but interiority relies on told emotions like "inexplicable connection" rather than deeply embodied contradiction. Micro-choices under pressure, such as following clues, reveal values, and the final act of displaying the locket is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Emilia's understanding of listening's power reconfigures her role, with cost felt in the emotional revelation. Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages, and orientation is anchored early in the courtyard at dawn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details, and the aged locket as a micro-setting object constrains choice and charges the final image. However, the courtyard itself does not heavily pressure tactics beyond being a backdrop for events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake in solving the mystery escalates through Emilia's agency, with one meaningful tightening as she delves deeper into the writer's story. Cost is legible in her invested effort and emotional realization, under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of listening healing emerges organically from events and the locket's history, but the final note "To those who listen, stories unfold" leans slightly explicit. Subtext operates through implication in gestures and silence, resisting moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a consistent perceptual signature, and dialogue with the mailman feels natural and goal-driven. Voice remains coherent under pressure, though not highly distinct in rhythm or lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with good rhythm and information density; no major loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "sandstorm calm" is effective and purposeful, without muddling peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The combination of thrift store curation and locked mailbox mystery feels fresh and specific, with emotional truth grounding the premise. However, it lacks high risk-taking or transformative innovation, staying in a solid, organic synthesis.</comment>
