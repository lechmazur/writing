<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., grief as "palpable weight"), and micro-choices under pressure (carving ritual) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final endurance (Earned Stasis) is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in accepting "here and gone." Slight tendency toward emotional summary in peaks, but no major flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early; accumulative/textural lens holds with closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Cost is legible in the final image of "rust-hued peace" and the completed carving, reconfiguring meaning without exposition. Persistent constraint of the carving process shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory details (rain-beaded skylight, scent of wood and tea) are selective and purposeful. The ash wood carving blank functions as micro-setting, constraining choice and charging the final image. Environment is woven into action, reflecting internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict of grief) escalates under accumulative lens through the carving ritual, leading to acceptance. Protagonist agency drives deepening, with cost legible in the foreclosed path of unmanaged grief. One meaningful tightening is sufficient, though escalation is quiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of "here and gone" emerges through particulars (kettle, carving) without direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the completed carving and "rust-hued peace," reweighting prior material. No moralizing; subtext operates in implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "rust-hued peace"). Voice is poetic yet grounded, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., carving process) is taught and pays off. No dialogue present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has varied rhythm and sentence structures, with high information density (e.g., carving and kettle interwoven). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; clarity and propulsion are maintained even in peak beats. Line-level craft supports closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Combination of widow, carving, and "here and gone" concept feels organic and fresh, with emotional specificity avoiding cliché. Synthesis is inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in quiet focus heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Some familiarity in grief narrative, but transformed through particulars.</comment>
