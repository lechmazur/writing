<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through intuitive actions. However, lacks internal contradiction or flawed impulses, reducing depth under pressure. The final choice to reconstitute the crystal is earned but without significant struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the crystal pulses with light, reconfiguring meaning under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in "the weight of her task" and the landscape's anticipation. Orientation is clear early, and lens holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the lighthouse orchard and ice floes creating atmosphere. The vintage mirrors actively constrain choice by enabling the crystal's reconstitution, charging the final image with the crystal's glow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes in maintaining balance escalate through the protagonist's agency in using mirrors to reconstitute the crystal, under the accumulative lens. Cost is felt in the burden of guardianship and the landscape's stillness, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mapping empathy onto action emerges through concrete events and imagery, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the reconstituted crystal symbolizing healing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—calmly intuitive and reflective. Lyrical voice remains consistent under pressure, and any elision (e.g., mirror glimpses) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm, but minor repetitive phrases like "weighted breath before reply" create slight momentum drag without obscuring closure. No major artifacts or muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (peacekeeper, crystal, mirrors) feels organic and non-obvious, with risk-taking in accumulative design. The combination heightens stakes through specific, grounded choices in character and setting.</comment>
