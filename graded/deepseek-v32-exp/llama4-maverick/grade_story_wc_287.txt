<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The gardener's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion in "wistfully pragmatic" pruning, but the character remains somewhat passive; the lockmaster backstory adds depth without compelling high-stakes choices, and the final purpose feels more realized than earned through causal pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (earned stasis) with felt cost in the dawn transition and rosebush's renewal; the accumulative/textural lens holds strong, reinforced by the quivering hush and oars rhythm, though causality is loose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the fire escape and harbor constraining choice (pruning) and charging the final image; sensory details like moonlight and oars are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, stakes escalate through density increases—the hush, oars, and lockmaster memory deepen the gardener's purpose; agency in instilling light forecloses inaction with visible cost in the dawn completion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of resilience and light emerges organically from images (rosebush cycle, lockmaster tooth) without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the city's wrapped tranquility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and lyrical, with a distinct perceptual signature in the gardener's reflections; rhythmic prose mirrors the oars' pace, and elision (lockmaster memory) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and dense, with varied syntax and no loops; minor overwriting in "weaving a spell of protected vulnerability" doesn't muddle clarity, and propulsion remains strong through to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of gardener, lockmaster, and harbor feels inevitable; the combination transforms familiar tropes through specific, grounded details in character and setting, though risk-taking is moderate.</comment>
