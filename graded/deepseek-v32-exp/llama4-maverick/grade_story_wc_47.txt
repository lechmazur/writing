<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Aria's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure, such as touching the amber pendant and accepting the flower, revealing a hierarchy of values. The figure is less developed but serves as a catalyst; Aria's motivation to heal is clear and intensifies, culminating in an earned resilience. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are filtered through specific perceptions. The final choice to embrace vulnerability is credible and costs her isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost: Aria's shift from vulnerability to strength is legible in "the amber pendant, once a reminder of pain, now symbolized the strength." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through atmospheric density. Orientation is clear within 120 words; the garden's sanctuary role shapes tactics. Persistent constraint of past trauma charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "soft earth," "honeyed hush," and "icicle pattern" filtered through Aria's POV. The moss garden constrains choice by providing solace and enabling the encounter. Recurring objects (amber pendant) charge the closure. Spatial choreography is coherent, with the environment evolving consistently.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of internal healing escalates under the Accumulative lens through density increases: the icicle pattern and flower proffer deepen emotional stakes. Agency is clear in Aria's acceptance of the flower, foreclosing isolation with cost. No coincidence; pressure coheres to a meaningful tightening where vulnerability becomes strength.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges organically from particulars like the pendant's recontextualization and the garden's silence, avoiding moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures, e.g., the flower offering as silent understanding. The ending offers a non-literal answer through charged images, reweighting prior pain without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; Aria's lyrical introspection reflects her state. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; voice modulates with emotional intensity, e.g., "flutter in her chest" under pressure. Elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing multiple elements, e.g., "the honeyed hush... enveloped everything." No loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated. Read-aloud test passes with varied syntax and clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of tech decay and natural renewal, transforming the healing trope through specific setting and character. Emotional truth is specific and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking is moderate but heightens stakes through atmospheric cohesion; no gimmickry.</comment>
