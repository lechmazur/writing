<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Ember's curiosity and restraint are consistent, with micro-choices under pressure (hesitation to incise). However, emotions like "sense of calm" and "overwhelming desire" lack specific embodiment, and the epiphany feels slightly unearned without deeper struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration under an Accumulative lens, with cost in Ember's renewed purpose. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds, though the realization could be more tightly causally linked to prior beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with sensory details (swirling clouds, glittering crystals) that constrain choice and charge the final image of connection. The library itself functions as a micro-setting that shapes the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are internal (understanding stories), with escalation through Ember's agency in choosing analysis over action, narrowing options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the foreclosed path of incising the bottle, but escalation is subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars (bottled moonlight, library fabric) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to where stories begin, though it leans slightly explicit in realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, introspective voice. Prose rhythm and perceptual signature are controlled, though dialogue is absent. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with varied rhythm and high information density, but minor redundancies (e.g., "mind mindfully scattered") and slight overwriting in peak beats reduce clarity. No major artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of concepts (glass orchard, bottled moonlight) feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in accumulative design. Specificity anchors emotional truth, though the premise is not fully transformative of tropes.</comment>
