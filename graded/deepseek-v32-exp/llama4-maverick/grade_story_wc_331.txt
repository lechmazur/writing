<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The librarian's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion (e.g., the scarf's glow), but lacks internal contradiction or micro-choices under pressure, limiting depth. The final renunciation of solitude feels earned but without significant struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative/textural lens, closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (stories reawaken) and felt cost (her effort). Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds, though causality is subtle rather than driven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (scent of paper, sandalwood) and a cohesive atmosphere, but it functions more as backdrop than a constraint on choices, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes (reawakening stories) escalate through the librarian's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in her urgent work and the scarf's response. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of stories as living entities emerges organically through imagery and action, with a non-literal, resonant ending that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext is rich in silence and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature (e.g., "hidden geometry of narrative"). No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with varied syntax, but minor repetition (e.g., "stories" and "analog memories") and scaffold phrases slightly dull momentum. No major artifacts harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of scientific poetry, hyperbolic geometry, and analog memories feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the lyrical approach that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
