<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and drives the narrative, but interiority remains abstract with told emotions like "familiar tug" rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The transformation is earned, but lacks visible cost or micro-choices that reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens, and orientation is clear early. However, the cost is conceptual rather than felt on-page, and causality relies on procedural generation without deepening pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and selective, with the viaduct's glow mirroring the internal journey, but the setting does not constrain choices or charge the final image beyond atmosphere, limiting its impact on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes are high and escalation occurs through accumulative density of echoes integration, driven by protagonist agency. However, the cost remains abstract and not viscerally legible, weakening the pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of self-discovery emerges organically through the labyrinth journey and the final image of "darkening brightness," offering a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. Integration with character arc is strong.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctively poetic, with a consistent perceptual signature. No head-hopping, but the lyrical style sometimes prioritizes atmosphere over immediacy under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and dense, but occasional overwriting like "periodically eternal" introduces jargon, and figurative language can blur clarity in peak beats without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes fractured timelines and procedural generation in a fresh, non-obvious way, with risk-taking in abstract concepts. The transformation feels inevitable and specific to the voice.</comment>
