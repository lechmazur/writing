<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied emotion; the courtesan's motivation to defy conformity is clear and drives the narrative. Micro-choices under pressure, such as untangling threads, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. However, the character occasionally edges toward archetype, limiting full individuality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the bittersweet echoes and newfound purpose. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the pattern of untangling threads escalates coherently. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (snow, prism light) are selective and purposeful, charging the final image. The prism sanctuary constrains choice by pulling the courtesan and enabling her transformation. However, the silver courtyard serves more as backdrop than active pressure, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defying conformity) escalates under the Accumulative/Textural lens through the courtesan's agency in untangling threads, with cost legible in the released echoes. One meaningful tightening occurs, but the internal conflict lacks multi-layered friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions, with a resonant, non-literal answer in the courtesan's transformation. Subtext operates via symbolism (e.g., prism, echoes), avoiding moralizing. However, some abstractions slightly dilute the thematic punch.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature. The prose rhythm supports emotional intensity, and elision (e.g., brief timeframe) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping, but the voice occasionally verges on overly decorative.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with clear propulsion and no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is pattern-taught and supports closure. Minor overwriting in peaks (e.g., "bodily poetic form") prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (courtesan, prism, untangling) feels organic and inevitable. The symbolic approach heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional truth resonates. However, the premise leans on familiar archetypes, limiting full freshness.</comment>
