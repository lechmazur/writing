<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The caretaker's motivation to preserve forgotten names is clear and consistent, driving her actions with reverence. However, interiority relies on labeled emotions like "foxglove regret" rather than fully embodied contradiction, limiting depth. Her final endurance is earned but lacks complex internal conflict, keeping it from higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the song's fleeting effect reinforcing transience and cost in her melancholic smile. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory layers. Orientation is clear early, and causality is intact with the song prompting the light's alchemical transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with opal library and glass orchids, sensory details weaving atmosphere that charges the final image of ethereal light. The environment constrains choice indirectly through the caretaker's reverence, and micro-settings like the wind chime recur with purpose. Economy and POV filter are strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes of preserving memory escalate through the protagonist's agency in singing the song, which intensifies the textural density and reveals cost in the fleeting moment. Under the Accumulative lens, this deepening reweights the dominant stake with visible melancholy, though it lacks multiple beats of pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory and transience emerges organically through images like the cracked wind chime and extinct feelings, with subtext in melancholic beauty. The ending offers a non-literal answer through continued preservation, avoiding moralizing. Integration is cohesive, though some descriptions edge toward overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, perceptual signature filtering details through the caretaker's reverence. Prose rhythm and syntax control support the accumulative mood, and elision (e.g., song fade) is purposeful. No dialogue, so voice coherence is unwavering.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with varied sentence rhythms and high information density, advancing atmosphere and character. No major loops or artifacts; figurative language like "alchemical" serves the moment without muddle. Minor overwriting in phrases like "nuanced blend" doesn't harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes deserted marvels and extinct feelings with freshness, avoiding cliché through specific, grounded details. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes, and the integration feels inevitable in hindsight. Transformation of tropes like the caretaker archetype is effective.</comment>
