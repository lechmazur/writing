<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Motivation is clear for both characters, with the ghost bride's debt driving the plot and the alchemist's longing shown through action. However, emotions like "mournful elation" are told rather than fully embodied in micro-choices, and interiority lacks contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with cost as the ghost bride fades, repaying her debt; causal lens holds strong with guided events leading to resonant awakening. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the debt shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and atmospheric, with the carved stone bead as a key object that charges the final image by unlocking transformative energy. The greenhouse's endless night and luminescent orbs create a cohesive, pressure-filled environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of debt repayment escalates through the alchemist's agency in claiming the bead, unleashing energy that transforms the greenhouse. Cost is legible in the ghost bride's disappearance, narrowing options under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of debt and transformation emerges organically from events, with subtext in the ghost bride's guidance. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the alchemist's understanding and loss, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a descriptive, ethereal voice that reflects the alchemist's perception. No head-hopping; rhythmic control supports pressure, and elision is purposeful, such as the ghost bride's fading.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive, but minor repetition of phrases like "mournful elation" and "resonant awakenings" creates slight scaffold without major artifacts. Information density is high, and closure remains unaffected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of ghost lore and alchemy, with specific details like the carved bead and debt repayment feeling inevitable. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
