<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in capturing a runaway dream, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses under pressure, and the final endurance lacks a sharply felt cost on-page, reducing emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Earned Stasis under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the dream remaining elusive, but the cost is implied rather than unmistakably legible, slightly weakening the resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the archipelago and tools like the camera charging the final image; the micro-setting constrains choice by shaping Elian's artistic process, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early, but under the Accumulative lens, escalation lacks a meaningful tightening or cost; agency persists but without narrowing options or visible price, failing the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of longing emerges through images and actions without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting the elusive dream, but some abstraction lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a poetic, perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure and purposeful elision reinforce the accumulative design without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with strong rhythm and information density, but minor paraphrase loops (e.g., "cipher of longing" reiterations) and elevated diction slightly dull peak beats without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in a fresh synthesis of librarian, archipelago, and art, transforming tropes through specific details; the inevitable feel in hindsight elevates it, though not highly risk-taking.</comment>
