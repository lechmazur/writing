<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Emilia's characterization is consistent and motivated, with clear traits as a blind artisan, but lacks interior contradiction or significant struggle under pressure, making the resolution feel smooth but not deeply earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the drone hovers steadily, symbolizing harmony; the accumulative/textural lens holds, but causality is somewhat abstract with light refraction as the key.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with mist, fountain, and depot, constraining choices through sensory details; the fountain and light refraction charge the final image, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Emilia's agency in calibrating the drone, with cost legible in her focused adjustments; under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres but remains low-key.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of harmony and precision emerges through concrete actions and images, avoiding moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the drone's flight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a meditative, descriptive voice; no head-hopping, but some flowery phrasing slightly undermines rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is elegant but has minor overwriting and figurative density, e.g., "industrious tranquility"; no major artifacts, but momentum drags in descriptive passages.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of a blind artisan using light refraction feels fresh and organic; specific details transform tropes, though not fully groundbreaking.</comment>
