<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Aria's pacifism and perceptiveness are clear and consistent, but lack internal contradiction or flaws, reducing depth. Her micro-choices, like repurposing the wreckage, reveal values, but the absence of on-page struggle or relational pressure limits motivation complexity. The final renunciation of violence is earned but feels static without palpable cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis is effective under the accumulative/textural lens, with the sword as a relic symbolizing the cost of foregone violence. Orientation is clear early, and the single-scene structure coheres. However, the lack of causal tightening reduces drive; the ending relies on thematic resonance rather than plot escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like the scent of roses and glass-domed enclosure, creating a strong atmosphere. Yet, the environment does not constrain choices or actively pressure tactics; it remains decorative rather than functional in shaping the narrative arc or closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (weaving continuity through chaos) is signaled but lacks escalation under the accumulative lens; no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs on-page. Aria's agency in renunciation is clear, but the conflict is static, with no reversals or cost-driven turns to heighten pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of peace and resilience emerges organically through images like the desert roses and engraved quiet, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the "tranquil blaze" symbolizing hope. However, capped due to Q4's escalation failure, as theme cannot outrun weak pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with poetic diction and rhythmic prose that reflects Aria's perceptive nature. No head-hopping or dialogue issues, but the voice occasionally leans into summary over embodied perception, slightly flattening immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with varied sentence structures and strong sensory imagery. Minor issues include awkward phrases like "senselessly perceptive," but no major loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Momentum is maintained, and closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes post-apocalyptic decay with pacifist cultivation in a fresh, non-obvious way. The desert rose farm and engraved quiet concept feel organic, and risk-taking in a quiet, reflective narrative pays off with coherence. However, some elements like "inculcating plants" are underdeveloped.</comment>
