<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks contradictory impulses in scene; transformation feels told rather than shown through micro-choices, reducing depth. The empirically ironic nature is stated but not enacted with cost, and emotional progression leans toward unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a charged poise with felt cost (astronomer's unity with cosmos), and the accumulative/textural lens holds. Orientation is clear early, and the tile's role as a persistent constraint shapes the final image, though causality is slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and atmospheric, with the palace and tile charging the final image, but it doesn't tightly constrain choices. Details are purposeful and filtered through POV, though some description leans decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sealing a covenant) escalates under the accumulative lens through the astronomer's agency in deciphering and raising the tile, with cost legible in their transformed purpose. One meaningful tightening suffices, but pressure could be more visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of celestial-terrestrial unity emerges organically through events and images, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext in the tile's symbolism avoids moralizing, though it occasionally borders on abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice and rhythmic control; no head-hopping. Perception is character-specific, but the elevated register sometimes overshadows immediacy under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is lush but overwritten in places (e.g., "shimmered like moonlight on a midnight lake"), with minor figurative muddle and synonym churn. Momentum is maintained, though density occasionally slows beats without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of ancient setting and cosmic devotion, with specific details and emotional authenticity. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
