<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority lacks concrete embodiment and contradictory impulses under pressure; her deliberation is told rather than shown through micro-choices, reducing emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing (key as metaphor) and felt cost in trepidation; causal lens holds with coherent linkages, though some progression feels summary-like.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and specific, with the observatory and key object charging the final image; sensory details are selective but could be more integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation occurs through Lyra's research agency, but pressure remains mild with no sharp turns; cost is subtle rather than unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of unlocking secrets emerges organically; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the key's reweighting, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice consistent, but lacks a distinct perceptual signature; no dialogue present, and elision is functional but not taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose has minor scaffold loops (e.g., repetitive description of research) and some telling, but generally clear; information density is moderate with no major obscurities.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes elements freshly with organic integration; the concept of sealed awakenings and reality-bending offers a non-obvious angle, though it echoes fantasy tropes.</comment>
