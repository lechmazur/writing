<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Luna's motivation is clear but static; no internal conflict or contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene. Emotions are summarized (e.g., "felt a sense of peace") rather than embodied, and micro-choices under pressure are absent, reducing character depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) but lacks legible cost; under the accumulative lens, no meaningful tightening or cadence shift reweights stakes. The drive lens holds, but escalation is minimal, with no causal pressure narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and selective, creating strong atmosphere, but the setting does not constrain choices or charge the final image. The lavender field and factory ruins remain ornamental, failing to pressure Luna's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No dominant stake is tested on-page; conflict is absent, and escalation under the accumulative lens is lacking. Luna's agency is passive, with no reversals or costs altering tactics, leaving stakes abstract and undeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of healing through art emerges coherently but is stated directly (e.g., "collective healing") rather than shown through events. The ending offers resonance but leans on moralizing, lacking subtext or earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and consistent, with a descriptive voice, but no distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic control under pressure. The prose lacks dialogue, and voice remains generic without character-specific idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Prose is clear but has repetitive phrasing (e.g., "dove gray map case" and "lavender field") and minor scaffold loops. Information density is moderate, with some overwriting, but closure remains unobscured.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The concept of nature reclaiming industry and healing through art is familiar and executed without fresh synthesis or risk. Details feel ornamental, and the premise lacks transformation through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
