<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied emotion, with motivation clear and micro-choices under pressure; however, the final identity shift, while earned, lacks deeply contradictory impulses acting in scene, slightly reducing impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) under accumulative lens, cost legible in "felt the weight of her task lift"; orientation is clear early, and lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details and purposeful setting; the crystal forecourt and shadows constrain choices and charge the final image, though some description leans ornamental without full tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency under accumulative lens, with cost unmistakable in the memory surge and identity formation; stakes are internal but coherently tighten through density increase.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer; slight abstraction prevents higher score, but subtext is well-handled.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and stable POV with poetic, controlled voice; no head-hopping, and elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density and varied rhythm with no loops or scaffolds; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory and identity with specific, grounded choices; risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, though not fully transformative.</comment>
