<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot, but interiority lacks embodied contradiction and deep emotional complexity under pressure, limiting peak impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) and felt cost of ongoing defiance; causal-accumulative hybrid lens holds strong with clear orientation and causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposeful, with the greenhouse and gourd seed charging the final image, though environmental pressure on choices is subtle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation is driven by Lyra's agency in planting and tending, with cost legible in the persistent risk, but lacks a major reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of defiance emerges organically through events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice fits the scholarly tone, but perceptual signature lacks distinctiveness under pressure, and no dialogue is present to test voice variety.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmic, but occasional overwriting (e.g., "converging chaos of thoughts and emotions swirling") introduces minor density without clarity loss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, with the gardening message method feeling inevitable, though it avoids high-risk structural choices.</comment>
