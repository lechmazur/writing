<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Emilia's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, but some emotional states are summarized rather than fully dramatized with contradictory impulses, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Emilia finds purpose, with felt cost in her mending heart; the accumulative/textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the file room and objects like the button constraining choices and charging the final image; dust patterns and micro-setting details integrate purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Emilia's agency in uncovering stories, with a meaningful tightening that reweights stakes and legible cost in her emotional transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of resilience and small kindnesses emerges organically from particulars, with a non-literal, resonant ending that avoids moralizing; subtext operates through images and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; prose texture is controlled, though some phrases edge toward repetitiveness without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose has good rhythm and density, with minor overwriting in metaphors like "sanctuary of remembrance," but no major loops or artifacts that obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of archival work and emotional recovery, with specificity in character and setting; risk-taking in quiet reflection pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
