<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and drives choices, but interiority lacks deep contradiction or flaws; the final satisfaction feels earned but cost is minimal. Embodied actions like picking up the coin show character under pressure, yet emotional complexity is limited.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the whisper proves her point, under a causal lens; cost is felt in satisfaction and uncovered secrets. Orientation is clear early, and structure is coherent with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (salt, rust, howling wind) and constrains choices through the labyrinth layout and objects; the container maze pressures navigation and charges the final image with eerie energy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear—proving whispers travel farther—and escalation is driven by protagonist agency through finding objects and encountering the stranger; cost is legible in satisfaction, though stakes remain intellectual rather than high-tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of quiet power emerges through events and subtext, like the whisper scene reweighting prior material without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer but lacks profound ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice consistent, with a perceptual signature in her observations; minimal dialogue is natural, but voice lacks distinctiveness under pressure, and elision is taught without payoff issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with varied syntax and no major artifacts; information density is high, advancing story through concrete details, though minor repetition exists in phrases like "whispers traveled farther."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of maze exploration and modern setting, transformed through specific details; risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes, but it feels competent rather than groundbreaking.</comment>
