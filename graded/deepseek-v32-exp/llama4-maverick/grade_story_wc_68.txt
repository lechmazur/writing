<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and internal conflict shown through his agonizing over narratives. His final endurance is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his raw hands and mental struggle. The "rationally rebellious" trait drives his choices, though it is repeated somewhat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in Kael's wry smile and contemplation of the hard road. The accumulative lens holds, building through layers of reflection and excavation. Orientation is clear early, and the cog keys the closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and specific, with the sewer and ruins constraining choices and charging the final image. The cog functions as a micro-setting that alters tactics. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Kael's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the accumulative lens, with stakes in uncovering truth versus official narrative. Cost is visible in his physical and mental strain. One meaningful tightening occurs as he deepens his excavation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the cog and ruins, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Kael's peace in darkness. Subtext operates in implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct philosophical voice. Prose reflects Kael's mind, and elision is purposeful. No head-hopping or dialogue issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density. Minor repetition in phrases like "rationally rebellious" but no artifacts harming closure. Sentence variety supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The combination of post-apocalyptic setting and philosophical seeker feels fresh, with specifics like the cog transforming tropes. Emotional truth is strong, though not fully groundbreaking.</comment>
