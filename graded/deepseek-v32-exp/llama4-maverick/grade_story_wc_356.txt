<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. Her realization feels earned, but lacks deep internal contradiction or conflicting impulses in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (earned stasis) as Lyra achieves serenity, with felt cost in her lifelong dedication. The accumulative/textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details filtered through Lyra's POV, with the corpse flower seed charging the final image. The treetop village is atmospheric but does not deeply constrain choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation is driven by Lyra's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in her transformed understanding and commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, with subtext in journaling and doodles. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though it leans slightly explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature. No head-hopping; prose reflects Lyra's sensory focus consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally vivid and propelled, but minor overwriting (e.g., "wildflower hush") and occasional purple phrases slightly reduce clarity without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of herbalist lore and wisdom themes, with emotional authenticity. However, it lacks transformative risk-taking or indelible originality.</comment>
