<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, with interiority shown through embodied actions like the shiver and mind racing, but lacks simultaneous internal conflict and uses some stock phrasing ("shiver run down her spine"), weakening depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the silence pressing in and secrets staying with her; causal lens holds strong with orientation anchored early and persistent constraint (the patch) shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting vividly constrains choice through the labyrinthine containers and wind patterns, charging the final image with the orange glow and emerging darkness; sensory details are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency via the survey and wind documentation, with cost unmistakable in the oppressive silence and determination; stake is signaled early and tightens under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of foresight and human element emerges coherently from events and the patch's symbolism, with a resonant non-literal answer in her clarity; avoids moralizing but has slightly explicit subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a perceptual signature focused on investigation; no head-hopping, but minor repetition ("hazy precision") slightly dulls impact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose has good information density and propulsion, but suffers from minor clichés ("shiver down spine") and repetitive phrasing ("singular convergence"), though no major artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh angle with the container setting and patch symbolism, integrated organically; competent but lacks high risk-taking or transformative originality.</comment>
