<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Kaito's motivation to decipher runes and transform scars is clear and drives the narrative, with embodied emotions like calm from sandalwood. However, interiority occasionally leans told rather than shown, such as "overwhelming urge," lacking deep contradictory impulses. The final choice to write is earned by whispers and connection, with visible cost in weight lifting, but agency feels slightly passive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Kaito achieves tranquility after writing, with cost legible in scars transforming and weight lifting. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density and pattern shifts. Orientation is clear early with who, where, and when anchored within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with floating platform, clouds, and sandalwood scent, creating a serene atmosphere. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Kaito's POV. However, the environment does not strongly constrain choices or charge the final image beyond ornamental tremors, limiting higher-band impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of internal transformation escalates under Accumulative lens through density increases in whispers and inspiration. Agency in writing decision is driven by mystical forces, with cost visible in past weight lifting. But escalation relies on external whispers, slightly reducing protagonist-driven pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of transformation and stillness emerges organically from runes, writing, and scars, with subtext in whispers and the final sunset image. Ending offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. However, thematic depth is slightly limited by lack of counter-readings or complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic perceptual signature focused on calm and mysticism. No head-hopping or dialogue, but voice remains consistent under pressure. Some phrases edge toward purple prose, though rhythmic control is maintained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and information density, with purposeful repetition of "stillness" and "saturated hush." No major artifacts or loops, but minor over-writing in peaks like "inexplicable affinity" slightly reduces clarity. Propulsion remains clear through beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes unique elements like floating platform and crow quill with freshness, avoiding derivative tropes. Specific details like sandalwood and whispers create authenticity. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
