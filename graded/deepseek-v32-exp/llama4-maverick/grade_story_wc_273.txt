<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in traits, with embodied emotion like "serene anger," but the time dilation quest feels somewhat abstract and told rather than deeply dramatized in choices, limiting peak impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Kael gains insight, supported by causal linkages under the inferred lens; cost is legible in the shared moment, though the time dilation resolution is slightly vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the ink patterns and drone constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Kael's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through Kael's agency under the causal lens, with cost in the emotional journey; however, the time dilation conflict lacks full resolution, slightly softening pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from patterns and time, with subtext in the connection moment; the ending offers a non-literal answer through Kael's tale, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature; no head-hopping, but the prose occasionally leans flowery without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and density, with no major loops or artifacts; sentences advance story purposefully, though minor purple phrasing doesn't obstruct momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels fresh and inevitable, with risk in blending tech and mystery; the concept is fully committed to and heightens stakes.</comment>
