<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion in actions like shaping the glass orb. However, internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses, and the "thoughtfully spirited" trait feels told rather than shown through high-stakes choices, reducing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Elian's renewed purpose, under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The drive lens holds, and the persistent constraint of the thawing heart metaphor shapes the final image of hope in abandonment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, like "cracked panes" and "damp earth," filtering through Elian's POV. However, the setting does not strongly constrain choices or charge the final image beyond atmospheric mirroring, capping the score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes around personal thawing and creating safe zones are clear, with escalation under the Accumulative lens through density increase in Elian's narration. But agency lacks a decisive tightening that forecloses options with unmistakable cost, limiting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images like the glass orb and thawing heart, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, minor explicit statements like "metaphor for the world's gradual awakening" slightly reduce subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a poetic, reflective texture, but perceptual signature occasionally slips into generic description under pressure. No head-hopping or dialogue issues, though elision isn't fully taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and high information density, but minor overwriting occurs, such as "weighty lightness" feeling contradictory and "morbid perfume" leaning toward mixed metaphor, without harming closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The combination of glassblowing in an abandoned control room feels fresh and synthesizes elements organically, but the core premise of thawing and renewal is familiar, lacking transformative risk-taking that heightens stakes uniquely.</comment>
