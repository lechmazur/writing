<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to uncover his father's legacy is clear and drives the narrative, but internal conflict is underdeveloped; lacks contradictory impulses in scene and the final poised stance feels more setup than earned change with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost in the weight of anticipation; Accumulative lens holds through texture buildup; orientation is clear early, and the metal door acts as a focal point reconfiguring options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory-rich setting with the lattice and prison constraining choice by guiding movement and charging the final image; "copperlight repose" and labyrinthine corridors are purposefully integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes of uncovering truth escalate through density increase under Accumulative lens; protagonist's agency to press on narrows options at the metal door, with cost legible in the atmospheric weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of legacy and storytelling emerges organically through images like the lattice and whispers; ending offers resonant, non-literal reweighting without moralizing, supported by the unfolding narrative threads.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature; poetic, rhythmic prose reflects the boy's reverence and curiosity; no head-hopping, and elision (e.g., "before they found the bodies") is taught and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Evocative, high-density prose with strong rhythm, though occasional phrases like "copperlight repose" risk overwriting; no major loops or scaffolds, and propulsion remains clear through to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of the cry wolf fable with a gothic prison setting; specific details like the lattice and scuffs create inevitability, and risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
