<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Emilia's interiority is concrete and her motivation is clear, but the epiphany feels slightly unearned as it arises quickly from the tooth without sufficient dramatized struggle. The "forgiving skeptic" trait is consistent, and micro-choices like picking up the tooth reveal character under pressure. However, emotional summary and diagnostic language ("spark of curiosity") slightly weaken embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Emilia's renewed purpose. Under the accumulative/textural lens, density increases through reflection and imagery. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The tooth's power is told rather than shown, but causality remains coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The secret garden is vividly described with sensory details and serves as a micro-setting that constrains choice by inspiring Emilia's realization. The changeling's tooth charges the final image, and POV filtering is strong. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details are integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal—making sense of past events and finding purpose. Escalation occurs through Emilia's agency in picking up the tooth and reflecting, leading to a meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in her changed perspective, but the escalation relies heavily on reflection rather than active choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of "turning mistakes into constellations" emerges coherently from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. However, it is occasionally explicit in phrases like "turn mistakes into constellations," leaning toward moralizing. Subtext operates well through the tooth and garden symbolism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and poetic rhythm. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., past events) is taught and paid off in closure. No head-hopping or register drift; internal texture is coherent and character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythmic control and information density, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting occurs in figurative language (e.g., "yearn for the stars"), but no major loops or scaffolds harm clarity. Syntax varies purposefully, and closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements (secret garden, changeling tooth) feels organic and specific, with a fresh inflection in Emilia's realization. Tropes are transformed through grounded details, but the concept isn't highly innovative. Risk-taking is moderate, with coherence in voice and theme.</comment>
