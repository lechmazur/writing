<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lena's motivation to rediscover lost joy is clear and consistent, driving her actions from discovery to creation. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as tracing the fresco and feeling a spark reignite. The final change—rediscovering joy—is earned through on-page causality, though lacks deep internal contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as Lena surveys her mural, feeling pensive mirth and peace, with cost legible in her transformed inspiration. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory details and artistic engagement. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district, with its fog and decay, constrains Lena's choices by inspiring her art and charging the final image where the mural pulses through the environment. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV, creating a haunting harmony that deepens the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rediscovering joy—escalates through Lena's agency in unearthing the fragment and creating the mural, narrowing her options from boredom to inspiration. Cost is legible in her renewed sense of purpose, under the accumulative lens, with one meaningful deepening that reweights the stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of art transforming desolation emerges through events and images, like the fresco fragment and mural, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the glowing fragment and reborn orchard, though some lines edge toward explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical, observation-driven prose. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., the abandoned project) is taught and paid off in the mural's creation. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats like the mural's description. Minor purple phrasing doesn't harm clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes artistic renewal in a decayed setting with fresh specifics like the fresco and exposed film, feeling organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, though it echoes familiar tropes without full transformation.</comment>
