<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensified by the terminal diagnosis, driving higher-stakes choices. Interiority is concrete through the diary and actions, but lacks contradictory impulses in scene. Final endurance is earned with visible cost in declining health.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as the caretaker finds peace amid decline, cost legible in "health began to decline." Causal lens holds strong from diagnosis to legacy. Orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sensory details (scent, hum, stone pillars) are vivid and purposeful, filtered through POV. Setting guides choices but does not fully constrain tactics; final image charged by orchard transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (interspecies respect) escalates under causal lens via caretaker's agency; cost is unmistakable in health decline and legacy. One meaningful tightening from diagnosis drives pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of harmony emerges through particulars like copper wire and orchard transformation, not statement. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (calm, systematic). Voice coheres under pressure; no dialogue, but prose reflects character mindset.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose has clear propulsion and rhythm, with high information density. Minor repetition of "gently systematic" is intentional, not artifactual; no loops or muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable; specific details (copper wire, architectural secrets) avoid tropes. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
