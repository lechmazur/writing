<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Worker's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion. The final choice to map dreams and heal the sextant is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in sorrow dissipating. Slight abstractness in the healing process prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the sextant is made whole and sorrow dissipates, under an Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the worker's sorrow easing, and orientation is clear early. The lens holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "stormlit tower" and "damp stone" filtering through POV. The sextant as a micro-setting object constrains choice and charges the final image, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by worker's agency in mapping dreams, with cost legible in sorrow dissipating.
