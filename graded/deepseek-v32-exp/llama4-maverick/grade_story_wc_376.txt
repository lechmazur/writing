<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Aria's motivation is clear and drives the plot, with interiority shown through concrete actions like her heart quickening. However, internal conflict is underdeveloped; her obsession lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene, making her journey somewhat straightforward. The final change is earned through causality, but emotional depth is limited by absence of embodied struggle under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative/textural lens, the plot coheres with a resonant reconfiguration closure as Aria gains new purpose. Orientation is clear early, and the zinc-etched plate serves as a causal anchor. Cost is legible in her transformed perspective, though the journey's pacing feels slightly summary-heavy in middle beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "acidic droplets" and "scent of decay," constraining choices during the undercroft journey. The greenhouse city pressures the narrative and charges the final image, with micro-setting elements (e.g., the repository) deepening atmosphere without excess description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes around lost conversations escalate through Aria's agency in piecing together the map, under the accumulative lens. A meaningful tightening occurs as she decodes the palimpsest, foreclosing prior ignorance with cost felt in her renewed purpose. However, external conflict is minimal, relying on internal drive.</comment>
<question>5</theme><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of candor in small moments emerges organically through events like reading lost conversations, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Aria's clarified vision, reweighting prior material without statement. Subtext in the repository's gilded-leaf scripts enriches emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, filtered through Aria's artistic sensibility. Voice is consistent and poetic, though dialogue is absent. Elision in decoding the map is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping, but rhythmic control occasionally slips into repetitive phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with good rhythm and variety, but minor overwriting occurs (e.g., "candor in small moments" repeated). Information density is high, advancing story and atmosphere. No major artifacts obscure closure, though synonym churn in descriptive passages slightly dulls momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh, synthesizing a calligrapher's quest in a toxic city with lost conversations, transformed through specific details. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids templates, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
