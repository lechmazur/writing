<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Emilia's motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses or deeply embodied emotion under pressure; final triumph feels earned but cost is not vividly felt on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (truth uncovered, ivy receding) under a causal lens; orientation is early and clear, but cost is more conceptual than visceral, limiting impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly described with sensory details, and the ivy charges the final image; however, it does not strongly constrain choices or alter tactics beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation is driven by Emilia's agency, but the conflict lacks palpable cost or tightening pressure; the difficulty is stated rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth vs. noble lies emerges coherently through events and symbols like the ivy; ending offers a resonant non-literal answer, though some explicit statements lean toward moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice consistent with a historian's perspective; no dialogue, but perceptual signature is distinct, though rhythmic control under pressure is not exceptional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and purposeful with good sensory detail; no major artifacts or loops, but some descriptive passages border on purple without harming clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Premise of a historian uncovering truth is executed with specificity through the illuminated letter and ivy, but it lacks transformative risk or high originality, feeling organic yet familiar.</comment>
