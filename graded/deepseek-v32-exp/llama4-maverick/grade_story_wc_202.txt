<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied emotion in jolts and shivers, but lacks contradictory impulses in scene; final purpose shift is earned through lens and painting, though cost is implied rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise with Lena's newfound purpose guiding future actions; accumulative/textural lens holds via sensory and intuitive accumulation; cost is legible in "heart afire" and vibrational anchors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (sandalwood, crystal facets) and micro-setting (lens fragment) charge the final image; market enables discovery but does not tightly constrain choices, preventing highest band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (uncovering hidden histories) escalate through Lena's agency in purchasing the lens and decoding the painting; cost is legible in her commitment to honor forgotten tales under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of honoring overlooked histories emerges organically through objects and images; subtext in vendor's whispers and painting details; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct mystical voice; perceptual signature in selective attention to elusive objects; no head-hopping; rhythmic control supports accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative but has purposeful repetition ("elusively tangible"); no major artifacts or loops; rhythm varies naturally, though some phrases border on ornamental.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of translator role with intuitive anchors; concept feels inevitable in hindsight; specific details (lighthouse lens) avoid tropes, though not highly risky.</comment>
