<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Emilia's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority (e.g., "fingers itched to probe"). However, her single-minded focus lacks contradictory impulses, and the final endurance feels earned but without deep internal conflict, limiting peak impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is Earned Stasis with legible cost in "sense of completion." Orientation is clear early, but the cost remains subtle, lacking a vivid on-page moment that charges the ending decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (e.g., "scent of old books"), and the tapestry fragment as micro-setting constrains choice and charges the final image. POV filtering is strong, though visual dominance slightly limits sensory balance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation occurs through Emilia's agency in probing the diaries, deepening knowledge. However, no meaningful tightening forecloses options, and cost is understated, reducing pressure under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and loss emerges organically through images like the tapestry and diaries, with a resonant, non-literal ending. Subtext is effective, but thematic depth is slightly abstract, lacking concrete counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctively lyrical, with a consistent perceptual signature. No dialogue, but prose rhythm supports the accumulative drive. Minor elision (e.g., diary entries summarized) is purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose has varied rhythm and clarity, with high information density. No major artifacts, but slight redundancy in phrases like "whispers of forgotten tales" and "echoes of the past" dulls momentum without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of historian and silo library, with specific details elevating familiarity. However, it avoids bold risks, and the displaced axis concept is underutilized, limiting transformative ingenuity.</comment>
