<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The surveyor's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority ("sense of interlaced absence," "heart burned with a hushed blaze") and micro-choices under pressure (retrieving the inkwell, placing notes). However, the character leans slightly passive, with limited contradictory impulses acting in scene, though the final endurance is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in the "interlaced absence" and "hushed blaze," under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the persistent constraint of absence shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion constrains choices (wading through murky waters) and charges the final image, with vivid, purposeful sensory details (silt, aquatic life) filtered through the surveyor's POV. Specificity elevates the atmosphere without generic clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by the surveyor's agency in retrieving the inkwell and documenting remnants, reweighting the dominant stake of uncovering stories with cost in the "interlaced absence." One meaningful tightening occurs, though it lacks multiple distinct reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of interlaced absence emerges through concrete events and images (the inkwell, notes), with subtext in symbolism and a resonant, non-literal ending that reweights prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is earned through specific particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and close third-person, with a distinct perceptual signature (poetic, reflective voice) and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (e.g., the notes' contents) is taught and pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language ("hushed blaze," "interlaced absence") is consistent and purposeful, with clear propulsion and no muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise offers a fresh synthesis of archeology and abandoned dreams, with specific details (inkwell, submerged pavilion) that feel organic. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, though it leans slightly familiar in theme.</comment>
