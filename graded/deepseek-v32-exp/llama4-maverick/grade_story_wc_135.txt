<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative, but interiority lacks deep contradictions or flaws that complicate choices under pressure, making the emotional progression somewhat straightforward.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (community healing) under an accumulative lens, with felt cost in the transformation from exile to hope; orientation is clear early, and causality holds without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly described with sensory details, and the harbor and valve charge the final image, but the environment does not strongly constrain choices or alter tactics beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes of community healing escalate through the archivist's agency under the accumulative lens, with one meaningful tightening as installations spark collective narrative, and cost is legible in the renewal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance and resilience emerges organically from events and symbols like the valve, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end that avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a descriptive, slightly poetic voice, and minimal dialogue feels natural, but the perceptual signature lacks distinctiveness under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is fluid with good rhythm and information density, though minor clichés like "sense of renewal" and slight repetitive phrasing prevent higher marks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The archivist concept is executed with specific details, offering a fresh angle on healing, but it relies on familiar tropes without significant risk-taking or transformation.</comment>
