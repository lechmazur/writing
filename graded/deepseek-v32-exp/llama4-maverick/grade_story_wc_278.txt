<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tattooist's motivation to hush guilt is clear and drives her actions, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. However, the attribute of translating baby cries feels underutilized and ornamental, lacking integration into key turns or cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (guilt lifted, peace found) under an accumulative/textural lens, with felt cost on the page. The drive lens holds, and orientation is clear early, though the time folding element is somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (sandalwood, machinery hum) and constrains choices, such as the amber talisman and laboratory environment charging the final image. Specificity is purposeful and enhances atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of internal guilt escalates through haunted firmware and letters, leading to a tightening under the accumulative lens. Protagonist agency in tethering and confronting turmoil drives the resolution with legible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of healing and confronting past guilt emerges through concrete events and images (letters, firmware), with subtext in implication rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and lyrical prose rhythm. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and any elision (e.g., time folding) is taught and pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density, but minor template cadence runs (e.g., repetitive "the tattooist" stems) and slight overwriting in atmospheric descriptions reduce momentum without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (tattooist, haunted firmware, amber) feels organic and fresh, with risk-taking in blending genres. The premise is transformed through specific detail and character-driven stakes.</comment>
