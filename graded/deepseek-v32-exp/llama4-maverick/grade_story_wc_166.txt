<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and drives choices, but interiority relies on some stock phrasing ("tranquility seep into her bones"). The final renunciation of exile is earned, though cost is lightly felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Aria achieves the cosmic verse and feels purpose; accumulative lens holds with cost legible in "weight of elective exile lifting." Orientation is early and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (night flowers, ocean) are purposefully woven; the twilight garden and moonstone charge the final image by enabling the dance and verse etching, constraining choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes (penning cosmic verse) escalate through Aria's agency in dancing; cost is visible in the etched verse and lifted exile, though escalation under accumulative lens is gradual rather than sharp.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of art transcending time emerges organically from dance and unity imagery; ending offers non-literal resolution without moralizing, though some abstractions ("essence of the universe") lean generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; poetic voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., gaps observation) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with good rhythm, but minor clichés ("canvas of stars") and slight overwriting occur; no major artifacts, and propulsion maintains momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tide dancer, moonstone, and cosmic verse feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, supporting closure.</comment>
