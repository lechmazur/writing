<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Operator's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative, but interiority lacks embodied emotion and internal conflict, rendering choices somewhat passive and thematic rather than deeply character-driven.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost felt in the library's transformation; accumulative lens holds strong with coherent causality from whisper to prints, though linear progression fits the mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the glass library and frost patterns constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details are purposeful and integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes around compressing eternity escalate through operator's agency under accumulative lens, with cost legible in the transformation, but conflict remains abstract without tangible opposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of eternity as depth emerges organically from images and events, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext in whisper and prints enriches.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively poetic, with perceptual signature focused on patterns and reverence; no head-hopping and rhythmic control supports the ethereal tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and dense, with varied syntax and clear propulsion; no major loops or artifacts, though slight purpleness in peaks doesn't harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, synthesizing letterpress, frost patterns, and eternity compression with specificity; risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
