<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in trait, with interiority shown through embodied emotions like "crushing doubts." Micro-choices under pressure, such as uncasing the flute, reveal values. However, some phrasing edges toward stock ("flood back") and emotional progression lacks contradictory impulses in scene, limiting peak score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in her "newfound reverence." Inferred Accumulative lens holds, with pattern taught by mystical experience. Orientation is clear early, but minor ambiguity in lens application slightly dampens impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory details like "scent of sagebrush" are vivid and purposeful, filtered through POV. The flute as a micro-setting object constrains choice and charges the final image, elevating score. Spatial choreography is coherent, though setting pressure on choices is subtle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal understanding) escalates under Accumulative lens through density increase in the flute's play. Agency in playing the flute narrows options with cost in transformation. One meaningful tightening suffices, but escalation relies heavily on texture over causal turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of harvesting insights from failure emerges through particulars like the flute's use, with subtext in its symbolism. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, some insights lean toward earned wisdom but lack full complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic diction. Voice coherence under pressure, though phrases like "avalanchingly quiet" risk register drift. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose has varied rhythm and density, but overwriting appears in forced phrases like "avalanchingly quiet." Minor template cadence in reflective beats, though no major loops or artifacts harm closure. Information density is high, with propulsion maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of relic keeper and mystical flute feels organic, with tropes transformed through specific details. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids templates, though premise echoes familiar archetypes.</comment>
