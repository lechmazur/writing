<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Character is well-defined with consistent traits and embodied emotion, but some abstract phrasing like "sense of wonder" slightly dulls specificity. The final choice to embrace her other self is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the lifting of past weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in "weight of her past lifting." Inferred accumulative/textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early. Persistent constraint of burned skin shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (e.g., snow hiding codes, mist revealing path) and charges the final image with the clearing mist. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens through density increase in the search and encounter. Protagonist agency drives the stakes, with cost legible in the emotional resolution and memory of burns. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of mending brokenness emerges through events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, supported by the encounter with the other self.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, but minor repetition of phrases like "silver hush" causes slight voice convergence. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose has good information density and rhythm, but template cadence and repetitive stems (e.g., "mist swirled") create minor artifacts. No figurative muddle in peak beats, though closure is slightly dulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of a burned spy's metaphysical encounter with herself feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the concept is transformed through specific choices.</comment>
