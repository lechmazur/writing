<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in trait, but interiority lacks concrete embodiment and contradictory impulses; the final revelation is told rather than earned through dramatized struggle, reducing cost legibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing under an Accumulative lens with stated cost, but the cost ("change her life forever") is vague and not visceral; orientation is clear early, and lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and selective, with the quartz arbor and prism charging the final image; however, the setting does not constrain choices, limiting its impact on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation occurs through density increase under the Accumulative lens, driven by the mystic's agency; cost is conceptual but lacks unmistakable on-page weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from patterns and images, with the ending offering a non-literal answer; however, direct phrases like "truthful lies" edge toward moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature; no head-hopping or dialogue, and elision is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose has good rhythm and density, but abstract language ("profound revelation") occasionally muddles peak beats; no major artifacts or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of mysticism and object agency, with specific details; transformation feels organic, though not fully risk-taking.</comment>
