<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Aria's motivation to defeat emotional numbness is clear and consistent, embodied through actions like humming and drum touching, but interiority sometimes leans abstract rather than concretely contradictory. The emotional shift from numbness to wonder is earned through accumulative textural pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as Aria finds peace, with cost legible in the receding numbness. The lens holds without ambiguity, and orientation is clear early, though the pace is gradual without causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The drum maker's cavern is vividly sensory and acts as a micro-setting that constrains and charges the final image, nurturing Aria's transformation. Details like damp earth and wood aromas are woven into action, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes center on internal conflict against emotional numbness, escalating through accumulative density in humming and atmospheric tension. Agency in Aria's actions drives a meaningful deepening, with cost visible in the emotional shift, though under textural lens, it lacks multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of silence and connection emerges through particulars like reversed melodies and the filament of hush, offering a non-literal answer at closure without moralizing. Subtext in imagery enriches reflection, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflecting Aria's deaf experience through rhythmic, poetic prose. Voice remains coherent under pressure, and elision (e.g., reversed songs) is taught and pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "mirrored hush" is consistent and purposeful. Sentences advance atmosphere and character with clear propulsion, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a deaf music teacher in a magical cavern with reversed melodies feels fresh and inevitable, transforming familiar tropes through specific detail. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
