<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's interiority is concrete but occasionally slips into abstract reflection; micro-choices under pressure, like tracing the discoloration, reveal values, but some emotional summary reduces immediacy. The final endurance is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in the frostbitten hope and peace found in silence. Orientation is clear early, and the path forward via discoloration reinforces the theme.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the cobalt fortress and snow creating palpable atmosphere; the dusty staircase and discoloration act as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image, integrating seamlessly with POV perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, stakes escalate through internal deepening sparked by the figure's appearance; protagonist's agency in endurance forecloses paths with cost, though pressure is more reflective than active.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of silence's cost emerges through particulars like the vow and encounters, avoiding moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with frostbitten hope reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and controlled, though elevated diction occasionally risks register drift. No head-hopping; elision taught via discoloration pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and density, but minor overwriting like "seraphically mundane" creates slight figurative muddle; no major artifacts or loops, and closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements like silent-choir bellhop and nerve regeneration feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet, reflective style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors universals.</comment>
