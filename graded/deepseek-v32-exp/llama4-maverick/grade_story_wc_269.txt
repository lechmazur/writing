<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to discover why paths vanish, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses under pressure. Emotions are embodied in actions like drum assembly, but the final realization feels more reflective than earned through high-stakes choices. The cost of acceptance is subtle but legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as Maya realizes the truth is in the sea's rhythms, under an accumulative lens. Orientation is clear early, and the torn atlas page and drum assembly lead to the realization, but the cost is understated. The lens holds without ambiguity, though closure lacks a decisive physical change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered through sensory details like the station's beeps and lapping waves, filtered through Maya's POV. The drum and station constrain choices by facilitating her rhythm practice and data analysis, charging the final image. Specificity is high, with the ocean environment mirroring internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering vanished paths) escalates under an accumulative lens through Maya's map-making and logbook review. Agency drives the escalation, but the cost—accepting hidden secrets—is subtle. Pressure coheres through density increase, though it lacks a sharp tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images like the drum rhythms and torn atlas page, offering a resonant, non-literal answer about the ocean's mysteries. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material without stated thesis, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, reflective voice shaped by Maya's perceptions. Diction and syntax are consistent, and rhythmic prose supports the accumulative drive. No head-hopping or dialogue, but elision is purposeful and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and variation, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Information density is high, though minor vagueness exists (e.g., "periodically eternal"). No major artifacts like loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of post-climate recovery with rhythmic introspection, avoiding tropes. Specific details like the coral witness role and drum assembly feel organic. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
