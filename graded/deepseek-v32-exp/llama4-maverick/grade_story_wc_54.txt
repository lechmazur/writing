<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority is limited with stated emotions like "sense of wonder" rather than embodied contradiction. Actions align with traits, but no genuine struggle or flaws complicate choices, reducing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with clear linkage from discovery to restoration. Closure is a decisive change with cost in effort, but the cost is mild and not deeply felt, limiting impact. Orientation is anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly described with sensory details (e.g., "dimly lit halls," "rusting pipes") that constrain choices and charge the final image. The terminal acts as a micro-setting that shapes tactics and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (restoration and hope), and escalation is driven by Maya's agency under the causal lens, but conflict is low-tension with minimal cost or trade-offs. The dominant stake tightens through her actions without high pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of hope and renewal emerges organically from events and symbols like the maze, with a resonant, non-literal ending. Subtext is present but somewhat straightforward, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, but voice lacks distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Prose is functional without head-hopping, but no dialogue and limited modulation under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is fluent with good rhythm and information density, but minor clichés ("beacon of possibility") and slight overwriting reduce sharpness. No major artifacts, though closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Concept of maze and engineering synthesis feels fresh and organic, with specific details that avoid template plots. Risk-taking is moderate, and the premise is transformed through grounded choices.</comment>
