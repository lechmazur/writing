<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene; emotions like melancholy and haunted euphoria are told rather than embodied under pressure, reducing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the haunted euphoria and legacy preservation; Accumulative/Textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early with who, where, when anchored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and selective, enhancing atmosphere, but the setting does not constrain choices or charge the final image beyond metaphorical resonance, limiting its impact on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving small moments) escalates through the archivist's agency under the Accumulative lens, with cost legible in her melancholy; however, tightening is gradual without a decisive turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of love and preservation emerges organically through images like the locket photo, with subtext and a resonant, non-literal answer at the end avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is reflective and consistent, though dialogue is absent and elision is purposeful without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and density with minor repetition (e.g., "haunted euphoria"); no major artifacts obscure causality, and closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Concept of archivist preserving moments offers a fresh synthesis, but it relies on familiar emotional arcs without significant risk-taking or transformation of tropes.</comment>
