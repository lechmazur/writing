<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Echo's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices like borrowing personalities. However, the trait of personality borrowing, while shown, doesn't deeply constrain choices or compound flaws, limiting peak emotional contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with Echo's clarity, under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the vanishing stars' urgency, but the link to Echo's actions is indirect, slightly weakening causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the Topaz workshop and vanishing stars directly pressuring choices and charging the final image. The Halo fragment acts as a micro-setting that constrains tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the vanishing stars timeframe, tightening Echo's urgency under the Accumulative lens. Agency is present in printing, but cost is more environmental than driven by protagonist trade-offs, limiting peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of emotion mathematics emerges through concrete actions and the final clarity, offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext in the printing process avoids moralizing, though the concept remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature. No dialogue, but elision and compression are taught and legible. Minor rhythm consistency issues under peak stress prevent higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, but overwriting in peaks (e.g., "swirling vortex of meaning") introduces figurative muddle. No major loops, though momentum drags slightly in descriptive passages.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes letterpress tech and emotion mathematics with specificity and risk, feeling inevitable. Transformation of tropes through grounded choices heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
