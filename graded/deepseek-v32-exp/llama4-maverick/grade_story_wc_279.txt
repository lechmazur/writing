<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied emotion; motivation to discover meaning drives the narrative. The "socially perceptive" attribute is mentioned but not tested due to solitary setting, slightly limiting depth. Final resolution feels earned through mandala interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) and felt cost ("lilac unease" lingering). Accumulative lens holds, with patterns building to peace. Orientation is clear early, and tile flake persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory-rich setting (grotto, mist) constrains choices and charges the final image; mandala and tile act as micro-settings that deepen internal stakes. Details are purposeful and filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal turmoil) escalates under accumulative lens through mandala patterns and agency (interjecting changes). Cost is legible in "lilac unease," but escalation is subtle without sharp turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of unlearning and meaning emerges organically through images and events, not statement; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext in whispers and patterns avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is selective and rhythmic. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., mist seeping in) is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lyrical prose has high density but suffers from paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "emergent hush," "sand mandala reflection") causing minor momentum drag. Figurative language is coherent but slightly overused.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elements (chalk artist, mandala, unlearning) feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors emotional truth.</comment>
