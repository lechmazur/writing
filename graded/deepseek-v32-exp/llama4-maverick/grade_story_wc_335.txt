<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. The final triumph is earned by prior causality, and the walking-backwards habit subtly subsides as tension eases, showing credible endurance. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with felt cost in the archivist's quiet triumph and the soul's longing, under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the tea leaves and shadow weaving a coherent pattern to the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The forgotten library and objects like the tea cup and shadow constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details (dust motes, creaking shelves) filtered through POV. The playground swing reinforces tone, and spatial choreography is coherent, supporting the accumulative build.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reversing exile) is signaled early, and escalation is driven by the archivist's agency in annotating the shadow, leading to a meaningful tightening with cost legible in the soul's longing. Under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres through density increase.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resilience and exile emerges through particulars like the tea leaves and shadow, with subtext in the archivist's combative tenderness. The ending offers a non-literal answer with the library feeling "less forgotten," avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and lyrical prose rhythm. Voice modulates under pressure, and elision (e.g., the tea leaf method) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with no mixed metaphors or register drift in peak beats. Momentum is maintained through concise, image-driven sentences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of shard-mirror archivist, reversible exile, and tea leaf geometry feels organic and inevitable, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details like the afternoon shadow and combative tenderness avoid template plots.</comment>
