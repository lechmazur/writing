<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Adelaide's motivation to discover hidden truths is clear and consistent, driving her decision to intervene. However, internal conflict is underdeveloped; her determination lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene, and emotions like "an odd sense of calm" are told rather than fully embodied under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise with Adelaide determined to uncover the truth, reconfiguring her family's legacy with felt cost. The causal lens holds from the journalist's call to her logical plan, and orientation is clear early. The rosewood pen nib serves as a persistent constraint shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The observatory and clouds create a vivid atmosphere that mirrors internal states, and the rosewood pen nib charges the final image with symbolic weight. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, though the setting does not strongly constrain choices beyond mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled with the scandal threatening the empire, and escalation is driven by Adelaide's agency in adopting proof by contradiction. Cost is legible in the weight of legacy, but the conflict remains somewhat abstract without concrete on-page tests.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus regret emerges organically through images like the pen nib and orbits of regret, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through Adelaide's resolve. Subtext is effective, though the concept of "orbits of regret" leans slightly toward thematic declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; the voice is observant and lyrical, reflecting Adelaide's character. No dialogue is present, but prose rhythm and diction remain controlled under pressure, with no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise and vivid with strong information density, advancing story and atmosphere. Sentences vary rhythmically, and there are no noticeable loops, scaffold, or figurative muddles. Minor overwriting in phrases like "orbits of regret" does not harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of newsprint heiress, logical method, and familial regret feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking with proof by contradiction adds ingenuity, though the execution is solid rather than groundbreaking.</comment>
