<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in curiosity, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in scene; emotions are described but not deeply embodied, with the final endurance earned but cost not sharply felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with legible cost in the cartographer's peace and purpose; Accumulative lens holds through layered discoveries; orientation is clear early, and persistent constraint of legacy shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the ivy-veiled passage and estate details charging the final image; sensory selection reflects POV bias, but integration into action could be tighter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering secrets escalates through agency-driven discoveries; cost is legible in the burden assumed, with one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens that forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of legacy emerges organically through images and events, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end; subtext operates in whispers and echoes, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic perceptual signature; voice controls rhythm under pressure, and purposeful elision in discoveries pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm with clear propulsion; no major artifacts, though minor repetition of "ivy-veiled passage" occurs without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of a corridor echo cartographer is fresh and specific, synthesizing legacy and perception with risk-taking in quiet narrative; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
