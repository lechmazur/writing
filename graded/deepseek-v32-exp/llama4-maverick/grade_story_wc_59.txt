<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prince's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative from sorrow to action. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotions like trembling hands and swelling heart, though some moments like "felt a pang of sorrow" lean slightly toward telling. The final shift to peace is earned through his agency in assembling the device, with visible cost in the emotional journey.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with the world's rebirth and the prince's peace, landing with felt cost under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and causality holds through the prince's actions leading to the device's activation. The flawed genesis acts as a persistent constraint shaping the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly described and integrated, with the suspended palace and egg charging the final image through atmospheric shuddering and light. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, though the environment doesn't actively constrain choices, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the prince's agency under the causal lens, from assembling the device to the world's transformation. The dominant stake of restoring beauty tightens meaningfully, with cost legible in the emotional trepidation and rebirth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from symbols like the egg and device, offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the world's rebirth without moralizing. Subtext operates in nostalgia and hope, reweighting prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, filtered through the prince's perceptual signature. Rhythm and diction control heighten pressure, and purposeful elision like the device's mechanics is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied syntax and poetic flourishes, though minor overwriting like "quaking reverie" slightly muddles peak beats. No loops or scaffolds; clarity remains high with closure untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of suspended palace, flawed genesis, and nostalgic prince feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in lyrical tone and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
