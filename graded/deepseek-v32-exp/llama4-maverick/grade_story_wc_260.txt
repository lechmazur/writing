<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lena's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure driving her reconstruction of purpose; the vague "con" slightly weakens motivation clarity but does not undermine earned closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Lena's peace; Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; orientation is clear early, and the chameleon's tail tip charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and POV-filtered, with the misty workshop and chameleon constraining choices and charging closure; details are integrated into action and mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake in balancing self-respect and compassion escalates accumulatively through Lena's agency; cost is legible in her transformed understanding, foreclosing prior paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of fragile convictions emerges through images and subtext, not statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the chameleon metaphor without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with lyrical voice and perceptual signature; no head-hopping; prose rhythm controls pressure effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of internal conflict with wildlife handling feels organic; specific details and emotional truth avoid derivative tropes; risk in quiet focus pays off.</comment>
