<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The storyteller's motivation to preserve the dying language is clear and drives the narrative, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses under pressure, and the final transformation feels more thematic than earned through personal cost. Embodied emotion is present but abstract, reducing visceral impact. The character serves as a conduit for the concept rather than a fully realized individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with the new language born from echoes, under an Accumulative/Textural lens that holds. Orientation is anchored early, but the cost of the old language's death is implied rather than felt on-page, weakening resonance. The flawed diamond's transformation provides a tangible shift, but causal linkages are subtle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the towers of bone and echoes actively constraining the storyteller's choices and charging the final image. The canyon functions as a micro-setting that pressures tactics, and details are woven into action. However, some description borders on ornamental without deepening stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes around preserving echoes escalate through the storyteller's agency in harnessing bird patterns, under the Accumulative lens. The crescendo of whispers and new lexicon creation represents a meaningful deepening, but the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt, limiting emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of translation and artistic transcendence emerges organically through images like the flawed diamond and bird patterns, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext is rich in the diamond's curse-to-blessing shift, avoiding moralizing. However, the theme occasionally leans abstract over grounded in character struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctively poetic, with a perceptual signature that filters setting through the storyteller's focus on patterns and echoes. Rhythm controls pressure effectively, and no head-hopping occurs. The absence of dialogue is not a flaw given the solitary nature of the scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with strong rhythmic flow, though minor overwriting in figurative language occurs without harming closure. Information density is high, and sentences advance atmosphere and character. No significant loops or artifacts obscure causality, but some phrases border on redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of echoes, translation, and flawed diamond feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric accumulation that heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity in setting and concept avoids cliché, and the closure reweights prior material with originality. Minor abstraction prevents a higher score.</comment>
