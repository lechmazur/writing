<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in the herder's cursed nature, with embodied emotion shown through sensations like "tingle." However, internal conflict is minimal, and the character's passive observance lacks contradictory impulses under pressure, though the final renunciation feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the vision reveals secrets with felt cost ("weight of unfulfilled prophecies lifted"). Under the accumulative lens, pattern-building coheres, and orientation is clear early, but the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details (salt scent, aurora glow) that pressure choices—the tidal bluff and rocks constrain the ritual. The environment charges the final image, meeting the 9+ test by shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (understanding cosmic patterns) escalate under the accumulative lens through the herder's agency in rock placement, leading to a vision with legible cost ("sense of completion"). One meaningful tightening occurs, but depth is slightly limited by passive elements.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the ritual and vision, offering a non-literal answer to cosmic secrets without moralizing. Subtext in the "lingering promise" and stardust use enriches resonance, though it leans slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature (e.g., "precognitive curse stirring"). Rhythmic control under pressure is strong, and elision (e.g., "ancient method") is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, but minor overwriting occurs (e.g., repetitive "sacred patterns"). No major artifacts harm clarity; rhythm varies naturally, though some phrases could be tighter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cosmic ritual with eel herder feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, supporting coherence.</comment>
