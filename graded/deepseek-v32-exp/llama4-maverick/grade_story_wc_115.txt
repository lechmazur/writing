<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete with embodied emotions like the shiver down the spine, and motivation to find the truth drives choices. However, internal conflict between skepticism and feeling watched is present but underdeveloped, and the final clarity feels earned but lacks deep contradiction. The explorer's actions align with curiosity, but flaws are minimal, limiting complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the logbook discovery, reweighting the swallowed truth with conceptual cost under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and persistence of the tunnel's constraints shapes tactics. The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and cost is legible in the satisfaction and clarity at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like decay and rust, filtered through the explorer's POV to pressure choices. The tunnel constrains movement and charges the final image with its oppressive atmosphere. Specificity is purposeful, avoiding generic description, and the environment actively shapes the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled as finding the truth, escalating through agency like touching the wheel and reading the logbook. Under the causal lens, pressure tightens with each discovery, and cost is felt in the emotional weight of the revealed truth. However, the escalation lacks a sharp turning point, slightly reducing impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths emerges organically from the explorer's journey and the radio confession, with subtext in silence and revelation. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the logbook discovery, avoiding moralizing. Integration is strong, but some elements like the ghost shift remain more thematic than deeply woven.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature in the explorer's sensory observations. Voice modulates under pressure, and the radio dialogue is reported effectively. No head-hopping, and elision is purposeful, though the psychic calls could be more integrated into the narrative texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and density, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without major artifacts. Figurative language like "morbid perfume" is effective, and there are no paraphrase loops or register drifts. Minor overwriting in "drowsy alertness" does not harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of factory ghost shift and abandoned exploration offers a fresh synthesis, with specifics like the beaded valve wheel adding originality. Emotional truth is grounded in the explorer's curiosity, and risks in tone and structure pay off. However, it leans on familiar tropes without full transformation, limiting ingenuity.</comment>
