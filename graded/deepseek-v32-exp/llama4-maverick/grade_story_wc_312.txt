<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The mage's motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority relies on labels like "earnestly naive" rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; the final pride feels earned but lacks deep internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (bell's toll signaling new balance) under an accumulative/textural lens, but cosmic imbalance causality is soft, slightly reducing cost legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (e.g., "sapphire viaduct at dawn") charge the final image; the viaduct and bell function as micro-settings that constrain and symbolize the ritual's stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cosmic imbalance) escalates through the gradual ritual under accumulative lens, with agency in rebuilding, but conflict remains abstract without tangible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of brittle devotion emerges organically through the bell's repair, offering a non-literal answer at closure; avoids moralizing but leans slightly overt in reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, but repetitive phrasing (e.g., "plausible impossibility") and elevated diction occasionally dilute perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid, but minor artifacts include synonym churn ("brittle devotion" echoes) and template cadence in ritual description, though clarity persists.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mystical elements feels inevitable; the lukewarm mage's method offers a fresh angle on restoration tropes without gimmickry.</comment>
