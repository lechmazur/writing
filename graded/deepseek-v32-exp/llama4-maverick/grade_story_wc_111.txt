<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dresser's motivation is clear and rooted in reverence for the garden, with interiority shown through precise actions like pruning and polishing marbles. However, internal conflict is subtle rather than sharply contradictory, and emotional embodiment relies slightly on nostalgic glow rather than raw struggle. The final sense of purpose is earned through consistent devotion, but lacks a pivotal moment of choice under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the garden flourishing and the dresser's bond affirmed, felt cost in the "bittersweet aroma" and cyclical renewal. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through patterned details like marble polishing and garden growth. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the ending reweights prior material without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—the garden maze with "scent of blooming flowers and gentle withering"—and actively constrains the dresser's movements and choices. Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered, charging the final image of the maze as a "narrative of love and devotion." The environment functions as a micro-setting that shapes the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (proving gardens know their gardeners) and escalate under the accumulative lens through the garden's measurable luck and the dresser's nurturing actions. Agency in polishing marbles commemorates victories, foreclosing other paths with cost in devotion. One meaningful deepening occurs as the garden's growth reflects care, though pressure remains gentle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the dresser's actions and the marbles' symbolism, exploring nurturing and memory without moralizing. Subtext operates in the "mended deception" and the garden's response, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer about cyclical life. Avoids abstraction through concrete particulars like the cracked marbles.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, reverent, and attentive to decay and growth. Voice modulates with ritualistic quality, e.g., "polishing the marbles was a form of prayer." No head-hopping; elision (e.g., marbles' memories) is taught and pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("blooming withering beauty") is consistent and enhances atmosphere. Information density is high, advancing story and character simultaneously, and closure image is clear without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing measurable luck with intimate gardening devotion, offering a fresh angle on human-nature bonds. Specific details like the cracked marbles and garden maze feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though it leans on familiar archetypes.</comment>
