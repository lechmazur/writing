<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and rooted in her role and personal history, with internal conflict shown through entangled memories. However, some telling phrases like "she realized" slightly reduce embodied emotion. The final choice to uncover truth for herself is earned, with visible cost in her liberation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Maya's peace and freedom. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through atmospheric details and memory untangling. Orientation is clear early, and causality is maintained via the lantern's catalytic role.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like damp earth and dripping water, selectively filtered through Maya's POV. The tunnel and lantern constrain choices and charge the final image, essential to the narrative arc and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth and personal freedom escalates under the Accumulative lens through Maya's agency and internal reflection. Cost is legible in her determination and liberation, with one meaningful tightening as memories untangle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of freedom and renewal emerges organically from symbols like the "Free at last" inscription and the lantern's history. Subtext operates through implication, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a consistent, calm narrative voice and perceptual signature tied to Maya's observation. No head-hopping; prose reflects her state, though not exceptionally distinctive under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and information density, advancing story and atmosphere. Minor scaffold in phrases like "Maya's thoughts were consumed" but no major loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Premise combines investigative role with historical elements organically, offering a fresh angle on personal liberation. Emotional truth is specific, but synthesis feels somewhat inevitable rather than groundbreaking.</comment>
