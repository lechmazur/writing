<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The skimmer's motivation is clear and consistent, driving its observational choices, but as a non-human entity, it lacks embodied emotion or internal contradiction, limiting depth. Its final synchronization with the pulse is earned through gradual appraisal, but the cost is abstract rather than viscerally felt. No relationships or secondary characters pressure the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the pulse synchronizes, implying cost through integration. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of observation deepens logically. However, the cost is more conceptual than vividly legible on the page, slightly weakening impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory specificity—towers of bone, dust, birds' shadows—that charges the final image and mirrors the skimmer's stillness. The canyon's vibrational hum actively shapes the skimmer's attunement, making it indispensable to the theme. Economy of detail maintains momentum without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes are internal and abstract (mastering navigation without movement), with escalation through deepening perception rather than causal turns. Under accumulative lens, density increases as the skimmer discerns hidden patterns, but agency is passive observation, and cost lacks tangible weight. One meaningful tightening occurs through the appraisal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of stillness and connection emerges organically through concrete images like the arrowhead's story and dust accumulation, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the skimmer's unity to the canyon's rhythm. Subtext in sensory details enriches complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature filtered through the skimmer's consciousness. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., time jumps) is taught and pays off in closure. No dialogue, but internal rhythm supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and precise, with high information density and varied syntax that enhances rhythm. No loops, artifacts, or figurative muddle; sentences advance atmosphere and theme seamlessly. Closure image is clear and resonant, demonstrating masterful line-level control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept is highly original—a stone skimmer as observer—synthesized with specific setting and theme to feel inevitable. Tropes of patience and stillness are transformed through unique perspective and grounded details. Risk-taking in non-human POV heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
