<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but told rather than shown; lacks embodied interiority and on-page micro-choices under pressure, though urgency is felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise under accumulative lens, but cost is conceptual rather than legible in a specific on-page moment; conspiracy remains undramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details and cohesive atmosphere, but setting does not constrain choices or charge the final image beyond ambiance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of uncovering hidden truths emerges coherently through imagery and subtext, with a resonant, non-literal ending that avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature; no dialogue, but elision is purposeful and controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and rhythmic with high density, though minor overwriting and metaphorical stacking occur without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of celestial embroidery and conspiracy feels inevitable; specific perspective and risk-taking heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
