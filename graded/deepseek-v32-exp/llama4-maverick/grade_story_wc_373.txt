<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is clear and drives key choices, but interiority lacks deep contradiction; emotions are embodied yet sometimes told, such as "mission to capture the sound of trust breaking" feeling abstract. Micro-choices under pressure are present, but the final stance lacks visible cost scaling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost in the fragile peace and understanding, and causal lens holds. However, the confrontation with The Shadow resolves somewhat abstractly, weakening the cost's impact on tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices, with the pirate market and watch fob charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered, though some descriptions like "dimly lit" are slightly generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lena's agency under the causal lens, with stakes clear and tension building to the standoff. Cost is legible but abstract in the "fragile sense of understanding," lacking a concrete trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of secrets and trust emerges through particulars like the watch fob and truce, with subtext in gestures and the ending's resonant ambiguity. However, lines like "power of determination" edge toward moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice consistent, with perceptual signature in Lena's observations. Dialogue is minimal but natural; no head-hopping, though prose lacks distinct rhythmic control under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with good density, but minor artifacts include abstract phrases like "sound of trust breaking" and slight repetition of "curiously steadfast." Momentum remains strong without major loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes moonshine runners and pirate market with fresh details, but echoes familiar tropes without high transformation. Emotional specificity is present but not uniquely ingenious.</comment>
