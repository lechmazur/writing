<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her actions, but interiority lacks deep contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure; emotions are summarized rather than shown through specific micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change under the Causal lens, but no visible or felt cost is legible on the page, weakening impact; orientation is clear early, and causality holds but lacks tension from cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sensory details like the hiss of static and soft glow of the console are vivid and purposeful, with the radio station setting enabling Lyra's choices, but it doesn't deeply constrain tactics or charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation is driven by Lyra's agency, but the resolution lacks a tangible cost or trade-off, reducing pressure; the dominant stake is resolved without visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of hope and cosmic harmony emerges from events but is stated explicitly at times, leaning toward moralizing; the ending offers a literal resolution rather than a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is consistent with a perceptual signature focused on cosmic signals, but no dialogue is present to test distinction; prose remains clear and controlled under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has good rhythm and clarity with varied sentences, and information density is high; minor clichés like "stars twinkled like diamonds" don't harm propulsion or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of cosmic conflict and determination, but it relies on familiar tropes without transformative risk; specificity in details like subsonic frequencies adds originality.</comment>
