<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. However, some passivity in reflection slightly limits agency, though the final acceptance is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong; closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost in acceptance of lost time. Orientation is clear early, and structure builds cohesively to insight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and atmospheric, with the glade and objects like the cracked saucer charging the final image. Details are selective and purpose-driven, enhancing theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes around lost time escalate through accumulative reflection, driven by protagonist's agency in pondering objects and memories. Cost is legible in the acceptance of fractures.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of cloudbound repentance and lost time emerges organically through images and events, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext in objects avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, and elision in reflection is taught and pays off. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with good rhythm and information density, but minor overwriting in phrases like "choking beauty" causes slight figurative muddle. No major loops or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cartomancy, memory, and repentance feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
