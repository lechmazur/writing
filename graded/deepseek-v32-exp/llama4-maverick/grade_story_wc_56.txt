<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and rooted in her trait as a legend seeker, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final realization about her own lies is earned, but some diagnostic self-awareness in peak beats slightly reduces authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost as Lyra gains hindsight clarity. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with pattern building through sensory details and instincts, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the canal and sundial constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Lyra's POV, enhancing the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Lyra's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in her self-realization. However, the escalation is subtle and relies heavily on internal shift rather than external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth and self-deception emerges organically from events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the sundial's revelation. Subtext is rich without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature that reflects Lyra's introspective nature. Rhythmic control is strong, though minor register consistency issues in peak beats prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and good propulsion, but minor overwriting (e.g., "serene upheaval" as a mixed metaphor) and template cadence in reflective passages slightly dull clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and synthesized with specificity, transforming the quest trope through character depth and thematic resonance. Risk-taking in internal focus pays off with inevitability in hindsight.</comment>
