<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The saxophonist's motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority lacks depth with no internal conflict or flaws; actions are embodied but passive, without micro-choices under pressure or visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the restored peace; Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong with music affecting mist; orientation is clear early, and causality is maintained despite mystical elements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposeful, charging the final image with the prism atrium's glow; atmosphere coheres with tone, though it doesn't strongly constrain choices, it mirrors internal states effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (calming prophecy's unease), and escalation occurs through music's accumulative effect on the mist; agency is present but cost is communal rather than personal, limiting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of music's power against fear emerges organically through events and images; subtext in mist and melody offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctively poetic with consistent perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure enhances the accumulative lens, and no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and clear propulsion; no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle; sentence-level rhythm supports atmosphere without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and imaginative, transforming tropes through specific setting and tone; synthesis feels inevitable, with emotional truth and coherent vision, though not highly risky.</comment>
