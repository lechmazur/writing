<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Yuki's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as a forger-restorer, with interiority conveyed through embodied work. However, internal contradiction is minimal, and the final epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness, though it remains earned by her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate, drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds firmly, and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost: Yuki's realization that she has unlinked herself from complicity, charged by the key and rose thorn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary and aurora are vividly specific, filtering through Yuki's perception. The setting constrains choice via the eastern apse wall that crumbles with intention, directly shaping the climax and charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (truth vs. complicity) are signaled early; escalation under the Accumulative lens occurs through densifying imagery and Yuki's agency in restoring documents. Cost is legible in her forgiveness and the risk carried forward, though external pressure is subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the rose thorn and key, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Yuki's unlinking and forgiveness, reweighting prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature that reflects Yuki's focus. Voice is consistent, and purposeful elision (e.g., the key's mechanics) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with varied rhythm and high information density. Figurative language is pattern-taught and supports pressure; no loops or artifacts obscure closure, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elements (calligraphy forger, calibrated treason) feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors the universal theme.</comment>
