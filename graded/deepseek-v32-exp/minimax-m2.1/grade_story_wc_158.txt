<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character is consistent and motivated; interiority is concrete with embodied longing. The final endurance (continuing to write) is earned by prior causality and the cost of centuries is felt. However, the poet is more archetypal than individually contradictory, limiting the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens held; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with visible cost in the trembling postcard and the “blossom armistice.” Orientation is clear early; structure coheres to a single shard with meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (gargantuan shell, galaxy postcard) is vivid, selective, and charges the final image. The shell spirals inward/outward mirroring her dual existence; the postcard trembles, reweighting the closure. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through the poet’s perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (enduring longing vs. creating beauty) escalates through accumulative density. Pressure tightens as the postcard trembles and she writes faster, offering an armistice. Cost is legible in the “weight of centuries” and the sustained dark.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (transforming pain into beauty, endurance through art) emerges organically from images and actions. The ending provides a resonant, non-literal answer with the “blossom armistice,” reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct lyrical voice. Perceptual signature is consistent; poetic diction and rhythm are controlled and heighten pressure. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, figurative, and rhythmically varied without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language (“photosynthesize pain,” “reef-shadow joy”) is consistent and supports the voice. Information density is high; no artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (insomniac poet, shell-house, off-key wind) feels organic and non-derivative. The lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Premise is transformed through specific, lived detail and emotional specificity.</comment>
