<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied; contradictory impulses (fear vs. examination) act in scene. Final promise is earned by prior causality with visible cost—accepting impermanence and extending the covenant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the acceptance of ephemeral joy and responsibility. Orientation is clear, and the locket persistently shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful; the blooming jetty at twilight charges the final image by linking generations and grounding the ritual of remembrance. Micro-setting functions as environment that reconfigured meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens—her reflection deepens, leading to a redefined preservation. Cost is legible in the promise to carry the covenant into an uncertain future.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (locket, jetty, steeping tea) without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: preservation as allowing moments to breathe and inform the present.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature reflective of the archivist’s meticulous attention. No head-hopping; rhythm modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and purposeful figurative language. No loops or scaffold; imagery supports the accumulative design without obscuring clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival ritual, generational covenant, and sensory memory feels inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet, reflective mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure is fully integrated.</comment>
