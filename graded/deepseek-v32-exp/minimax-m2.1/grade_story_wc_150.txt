<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in personal history; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion like "cautious enchantment." Her final choice to rebuild the sundial is earned by prior discoveries and ancestral legacy, with visible cost in her interrupted journey. No contradictory impulses in scene, but her warm curiosity persists despite fatigue, driving credible agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as Mira restores the sundial, feeling "a homecoming that was also a departure." Cost is legible on-page in the ancestral interruptions and her renewed journey. Orientation anchored early; structure coherent with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—catacomb orchard, roots snaking between bones—and actively constrains choice (limited passage, sundial discovery) and charges the final image with the apple tree and sundial placement. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Mira's POV, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding heritage) escalates accumulatively through Mira's agency: she excavates, rebuilds, and reconfigures meaning. Cost is felt in her labor and the weight of interrupted journeys. One meaningful deepening—the sundial's symbolism—reweights options and leads to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of interrupted journeys and rebirth emerges organically through concrete images (roots, sundial, bones) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the sundial's restoration, recharging prior material with cyclical continuity and loss transformed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV (third-person limited) is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature ("cautious enchantment," "trembling shadows"). Voice modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping. Prose rhythm supports the accumulative texture, and elision (e.g., grandmother's backstory) is anchored in present cues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density, varied syntax, and no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language ("roots snaked between ancient bones like静脉") is consistent and purposeful, enhancing momentum without muddle. Read-aloud rhythm is natural, and every sentence advances story or atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of diaspora return, catacomb orchard, and sundial symbolism feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific details (birthmark matching symbols, roots as veins). Risk-taking in lyrical accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure lands with emotional authenticity.</comment>
