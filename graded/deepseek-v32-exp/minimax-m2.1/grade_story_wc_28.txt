<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lysara's interiority is concrete and contradictory; her retrocognitive trap and gentle radicalism drive micro-choices that culminate in the earned renaming with visible cost—Soren's transformation and the bell's ring. The child's presence applies immediate pressure, and the hierarchy of values (preservation over starting fresh) is legible throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where renaming reweights mercy and preservation with cost felt in "warmth... like holding an ember." Orientation is clear early; the tessera's pattern shift and final image of light and bell ringing land decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting—plaza, ash, shattered sky—constrains choice via the tessera and charges the final image with the shaft of light. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; the mosaic stone acts as micro-setting that shapes the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preservation vs. loss) escalates through Lysara's agency: finding the tessera and recognizing Soren's echo lead to renaming. Cost is legible in Soren's understanding and the "arms of steel" empathy, foreclosing other paths under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of aberrant mercy and resurrection emerges through particulars—the tessera's patterns, Soren's silence—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the bell ringing and light, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by retrocognitive visions; lyrical rhythm modulates with pressure. Dialogue is minimal but natural; no head-hopping, and elision (e.g., Soren's nod) is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with varied rhythm and high information density. No loops or scaffold; figurative language ("like water finding its path") is consistent and serves closure. Minor ornamentation does not obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic preservation, retrocognition, and sacred renaming feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity in the tessera and "warm coldness" tone transforms tropes.</comment>
