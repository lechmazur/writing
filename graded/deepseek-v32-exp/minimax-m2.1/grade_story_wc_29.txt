<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maya's motivation and interiority are concrete, and her micro-choices under pressure reveal competence and determination. However, the characterization lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, limiting emotional depth. The final shift to steady resilience is earned but without intense internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost (ongoing vigilance) and a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise). The ending image reweights prior material and the persistent constraint of future tricksters shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The radio booth and astronomical charts are tactile, purpose-driven details that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory selection reflects Maya's professional focus, and the micro-setting is integral to the conflict's escalation and resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring agency) is clear; escalation is driven by Maya's agency under the causal lens. Cost is legible in her all-night effort and the risk of equipment damage, though the emotional price is not deeply visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of manipulation vs. agency emerges organically from the conflict, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer. One line ("the cosmos was full of entities...") states the theme a bit overtly, but overall integration is strong.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic technicality that reflects Maya's perceptual signature. Voice modulates with pressure, and the absence of dialogue does not diminish control or coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language serves pressure without muddle, and sentence-level propulsion accelerates appropriately with the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh, specific synthesis of cosmic horror and campus politics; the premise feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in genre blending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the emotional truth of quiet defense resonates.</comment>
