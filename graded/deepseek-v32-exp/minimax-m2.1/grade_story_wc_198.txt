<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and clear motive rooted in duty, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, preventing the highest band. The final endurance is earned with visible cost in his ragged breath and nostalgia.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clean single-scene structure with immediate orientation; closure is a resonant Earned Stasis that lands on the page with felt cost (ragged breath, weight of nostalgia) under an accumulative/textural lens that holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory-rich setting is fully integrated with action; the grotto and prism atrium shape the protagonist's tactics (melody matches dewdrops) and charge the atmosphere, though the final image is not directly constrained by it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silencing the prophecy) escalates through the prophecy's press and a breakthrough phrase; protagonist's agency in shattering it drives the tightening, with cost legible in his physical fatigue and the grotto's relieved breathing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of duty, silence, and dangerous knowledge emerges organically from concrete actions and images; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the saxophonist's nostalgic weight and the prophecy's continued dormancy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical third-person limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is controlled and rhythmically varied under pressure, and all elision (negative space) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Flawless line-level craft with high information density and no loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and clear, prose rhythm supports the accumulative pressure, and the closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of concepts (prophecy silenced through musical negative space) feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in lyricism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the premise is fully committed.</comment>
