<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maruk’s frugality and thoroughness are consistent, concrete traits that compel his discovery and final ritual. His motivation intensifies credibly from scholarly curiosity to urgent, covenant-renewing agency under the pressure of the regime change. The final choice to perform the ritual is a micro-choice that reveals his hierarchy of values (preserving cosmic order over personal safety) with a visible cost in the transformed atmosphere. A slight deduction because his emotional interiority, while present, leans slightly toward diagnostic summary in the "empirical irony" realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens is strong and held. The inciting incident (discovering schematics) leads through because/therefore linkages to the climax (the ritual) and a resonant reconfiguration (the renewed covenant). Orientation is immediate; closure lands on the page with clear cost—the palace’s newfound peace is the felt price of the renewed pact. The persistent constraint of the "transitional moment" tightens the final act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, not backdrop. The palace observatory is a micro-setting that constrains and enables the ritual; the magic square tile is an object-as-setting that charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (candlelight, subsonic resonance). The "dusky twilight" atmosphere coheres and mirrors the thematic "accord."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from personal/scholarly to cosmic/civic under the causal lens. Maruk’s agency drives each turn—his research, his decision to act. The cost is legible in the final atmosphere ("palace seemed more peaceful...stars seemed closer"). One meaningful tightening: the approaching new regime forces the ritual, narrowing his options to act now or fail.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of hidden order vs. empirical oversight emerges organically from the plot and is crystallized in the "dusky accord" final image. The encrypted love poem as a covenant offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of what sustains civilization. Subtext operates powerfully in the contrast between Maruk's frugal counting and the lavish, forgotten devotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled—scholarly precision blended with poetic gravity, reflecting Maruk’s astronomer POV. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent (noticing patterns, counting, celestial constancy). The prose modulates effectively under pressure, e.g., "trembling hands" then "gentle harmony."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and purposeful with high information density. Sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously. Minor artifact: a slight template cadence in the "empirical irony" paragraph ("The astronomers...had grown...had failed...had accidentally..."). No figurative muddle; closure image is clear and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of mathematical magic, political twilight, and cryptographic devotion feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and integrated through character and plot. The transformation of a "magic square" from curio to cosmic key is a specific, non-obvious angle that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
