<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and her motivation clear; her quiet yearning and micro-choices (keeping the keystone) reveal values, and her final realization is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the garden's completion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The plot moves causally from keystone to mist-walking to garden; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing) with cost legible in the final image; the accumulative lens holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the icebound spire's automation contrasts with the keystone's warmth, and the garden's impossible geometry charges the closure; sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding meaning vs. automation) escalates through Mira's agency with the keystone; one meaningful tightening (ward failure/mist) leads to a cost: the realization that automation lacks the sacred.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images (lingering luminance, brilliant dimness) and Mira's realization; the ending offers a non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and voice is distinct: lyrical, contemplative, with a perceptual signature that reflects Mira's character; no head-hopping, and elision (like effortless mist-walking) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with varied rhythm and high information density; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar elements (mage, tower) with automation and sacred simplicity in a fresh, inevitable way; risk-taking in the quiet, lyrical ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
