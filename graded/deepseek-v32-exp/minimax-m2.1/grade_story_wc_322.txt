<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority and philosophy are concrete and character-particular; her final acceptance of blurred memories is earned by the prior weaving and eruption, with visible cost. Minor abstraction in the rational enchantment concept does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Charged Poise with clear conceptual cost ("never fully distinguish between memories"). Orientation is immediate, and the pattern of sensory accumulation leads coherently to the resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Gallery and sinew thread are vivid, tactile, and constrain choice; the setting actively recalibrates with her weaving and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, escalation is a density increase (eruption, glowing threads) that reweights the internal stake; cost is legible in the blurring of memory. Protagonist's agency (continuing to weave, then sitting in acceptance) drives the tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reality/illusion emerges through concrete action and image; the final sentence offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext is woven into gesture and perception.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, precise, and professional. Voice modulates with emotional intensity; no head‑hopping. Elision (memory alteration) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and artifact‑free; figurative language is consistent and purposeful. Sentences vary in length and structure, propelling the accumulative drive without loops or scaffold that obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of art, perception, and memory; the fever‑dream architect concept is transformed through specific, grounded details. Risk‑taking in abstract concepts heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
