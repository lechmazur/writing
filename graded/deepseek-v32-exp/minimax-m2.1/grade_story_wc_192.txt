<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply interior with embodied emotion; the protagonist's realization and choice to step through the threshold are earned by prior causality and show visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens; the fading threshold as persistent constraint shapes tactics, and cost is legible in the final image of stepping into the "suffocating breath."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ashen charcoal sanctuary and doorknocker ring are micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory details are selective and filtered through POV, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake between isolation and connection escalates through the encroachment and confrontation with her past self; agency drives the tightening, with cost felt in the suffocating breath of the world.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images of thresholds and suffocation; the ending offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and rhythmic control; perceptual signature is character-specific and consistent under pressure, with no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density without loops or artifacts; figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off, supporting momentum and clarity even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes familiar tropes into a fresh, inevitable arc; risk-taking in poetic abstraction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, with a specific non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
