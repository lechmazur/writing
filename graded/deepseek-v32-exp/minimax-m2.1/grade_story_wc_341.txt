<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Miriam's grief and scientific rigor are concretely embodied; her internal conflict and final integration feel earned through specific observations and micro-choices, with visible cost in her memorializing act.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds cleanly; orientation is immediate; closure lands as a charged poise where grief and science spool together, with cost legible in the final suspended moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sky gondola and brass telescope are indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image; sensory details are selective, purposeful, and fully integrated with POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciling grief with science) escalates through layered observations; protagonist's agency in memorializing leads to a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of absence as presence emerges through concrete images (clouds, telescope, strings); final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature; lyrical yet precise diction matches the character's expertise and emotional state, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dense, poetic lines with varied rhythm; zero loops or artifacts; figurative language is consistent and heightens pressure without obscuring clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorology and grief; specific, non-obvious angle on loss and memory; risk-taking in quiet internal plot pays off with inevitable feeling.</comment>
