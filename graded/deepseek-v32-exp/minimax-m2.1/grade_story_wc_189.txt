<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira’s characterization is precise and embodied—her professional lens (“collect transitions”) directly informs her micro-choices (pressing the cicada, placing it as an offering) under the pressure of the pause. The sister is less developed but serves as a credible secondary pressure. The final choice to offer the cicada and articulate her work feels earned by prior causality, though the sister’s softening occurs swiftly, slightly limiting the cost’s depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is clear and held throughout; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the tide-turning image reweights the relationship stake with felt cost (three years of silence, struggle for language). Orientation is immediate; structure is a single scene with integrated reflection that pays off in the final image. The cost is legible in the final paragraph’s “patient work of transition.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the grotto, tidal pools, and stars are not just atmospheric but constrain choice (enclosed space for difficult conversation) and charge the final image (water catching stars, tide turning). Sensory details are selective and filtered through Mira’s POV (mineral coolness of cicada, starlight on water). Spatial choreography is coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciliation) is signaled early and escalates through the accumulative density of the pause and Mira’s tangential approach. Agency resides in her decision to place the cicada as an offering, which narrows options and prompts her sister’s softer response. Cost is visible in the “three years of silence” and the “struggling to find language,” though the sister’s turn is slightly abrupt, limiting the price’s weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transitions emerges organically from concrete particulars (tidal shifts, cicada, grotto erosion) and is inextricable from Mira’s arc. Subtext operates in silence, gesture, and the cicada’s offering. The ending provides a resonant, non-literal answer (“the tide was turning”) that reweights prior material without moralizing. Epiphanies are earned through specific, dramatized reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV (Mira) is stable and apt; voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with perceptual signature shaped by her chronicler’s worldview. Syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional pressure (e.g., the long, reflective sentences in the pause). Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; metaphors (silence like a pool’s surface, transition as anticipation crystallized) are coherent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs (contemplative then tightening). Closure image is clear and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar reconciliation narrative through the specific lens of a tidal-pool chronicler and the concept of liminal transitions. The jade cicada and grotto setting are irreplaceable, not ornamental. Risk of a quiet, accumulative design pays off with a charged poise. The perspective feels memorable and authentically executed.</comment>
