<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias is richly characterized through concrete interiority and embodied emotion. His motivation is clear and intensifies, and his final realization is earned by prior causality with visible cost (years of searching). The change from active searching to receptive waiting feels inevitable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The accumulative lens holds, building to a resonant reconfiguration where Elias receives the color of sound. Closure lands with cost (the shift in understanding) and is shaped by the persistent constraint of his father's vow. Orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and integral: the sunken ship library constrains access (low tide) and charges the final image with the transformed lantern light. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake (discovering the color of sound) escalates through Elias's repeated visits and culminates in the meteor-triggered shift. Cost is legible in his three-year search and the realization that demand must yield to reception.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and action, culminating in a non-literal answer: the color of sound is received, not found. The father's vow is a luminous concept that reweights without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Elias's perception. POV is stable and the prose's rhythm supports the accumulative texture. No dialogue, but internal voice is strong.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative but maintains clarity and propulsion. No loops or scaffold; information density is high. Minor risk of overwriting does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise is original and synthesized with specificity: a pier lamplighter's search for the color of sound in a sunken library. The turns feel earned and the emotional truth is grounded in character.</comment>
