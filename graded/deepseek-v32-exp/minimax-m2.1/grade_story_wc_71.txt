<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira’s specific attentiveness is concretely embodied through sensory details and micro-choices, driving her realization. Her motivation—to understand why houses feel alive—is clear and consistently roots her actions. The final earned recognition carries the quiet cost of inherited sensitivity. However, the absence of on-page relationships or internal contradiction limits the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds perfectly; the closure is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the house’s “aliveness” with undeniable cost in the “quiet blaze of recognition.” Orientation is immediate, and the pattern of displaced objects builds inexorably to the final realization without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is filtered through Mira’s hyper-attentive POV, with the orris root shard and the house itself charging the final image. Sensory details (orris scent, streetlight glow) are selective and purposeful, creating an atmosphere that is integral to the thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (understanding the house’s aliveness) are signaled early and escalate through Mira’s accumulative noticing. Under the accumulative lens, density increases until the final reconfiguration. Agency resides in her attention, and the cost is legible in the reconfigured understanding, though not a visceral trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of inherited memory and the aliveness of places emerges through concrete particulars, never stated. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior details. Subtext operates through displaced objects and the orris root’s pulsing warmth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, with a distinct lyrical voice that mirrors Mira’s perceptual signature. Syntax and rhythm modulate with her attentiveness, and the prose maintains a hushed, precise tone throughout. No head-hopping or distance issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and flawlessly controlled. Sentences advance character, atmosphere, and theme without scaffolding or loops. Figurative language (“streetlights daydream,” “shard of hush”) is consistent and purposeful, and the final paragraph lands with resonant clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story transforms the familiar “haunted house” trope through a fresh angle: a “creeping normality noticer” and the concept of houses alive with accumulated memory. Synthesis feels organic and inevitable, with risk-taking in its quiet, accumulative design that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
