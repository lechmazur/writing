<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete, contradictory, and embodied ("a detail so mundane it humiliates the gravity of survival"). The final stance of "bleak exhilaration" is an Earned Stasis rooted in established causality—his analytical hunt is a direct, character-specific response to unimaginable loss. The hierarchy of values (search over closure) is revealed through micro-choices under pressure, like holding the geode to the light. A minor deduction for a moment of slightly diagnostic language ("perturbation theory applied to existential crisis"), though it's quickly grounded in character voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held flawlessly: pressure escalates through reflective density and pattern repetition (geode, potential, calculation). Closure is a resonant Charged Poise—the final image of holding the geode to the light crystallizes the hunt's endless, necessary cost. Orientation is immediate and concrete. The cost is legible on-page in the final paragraph's "understanding that I will never know, coupled with the certainty that the search matters."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and deeply filtered through the POV's analytical, traumatized lens. The micro-settings (geode in palm, observatory window) are not just described but constrain choice and charge the final image. The geode's physicality ("mottled with scorch marks") and the observatory's "electromagnetic cables that hum" are integrated into action and theme, creating a coherent, pressurized atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as a decisive intensification of the dominant stake (hunting "unused potential") through increased reflective density and a cadence shift into the final, resigned realization. The cost—the endless, unresolved search—is legible and felt. The agency is in the protagonist's sustained attention and intellectual stance, which forecloses the path of conventional mourning with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (the search for meaning in aftermath, the mathematics of grief) emerges organically from the confluence of the geode, perturbation theory, and the wedding strike. Subtext is rich in the geode's evolving symbolism. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image, reweighting prior material without moralizing. The integration of concept (unfiltered awakening) and emotional truth is exceptional.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable, deeply characterized, and the voice is distinct—a blend of poetic observation and scientific rigidity that reflects a mind under pressure. The perceptual signature is unmistakable. Syntax and rhythm modulate purposefully with emotional intensity, from clipped facts ("Seventeen survived") to sprawling, reflective sentences. No head-hopping; all elision feels purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly controlled with strong rhythmic variation. Information density is high; most sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. A minor deduction for a slight risk of figurative over-density in the final paragraph ("like a sleeping god finally waking, like the unfiltered awakening..."), which momentarily leans toward synonymic accumulation, though it remains legible and voice-consistent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of high-concept mathematical theory, intimate trauma, and a geological metaphor is original, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on survival narratives. Bold risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without becoming a gimmick. The story commits fully to its singular artistic stance.</comment>
