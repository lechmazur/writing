<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tide dancer's interiority is concrete and embodied; micro-choices under pressure reveal values; final renunciation earned with cost as anchor dissolves.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with on-page cost (anchor dissolves); accumulative/textural lens holds; orientation clear; persistent exile constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Moonstone speck and twilight garden constrain choice and charge final image; sensory details are selective and filtered through POV; no spatial or consistency issues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (penning verse to transcend exile) escalates via protagonist agency; cost legible in anchor dissolution; one meaningful tightening under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of exile as arrival emerges through imagery and final realization; subtext in gaps and silence; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
