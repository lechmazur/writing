<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and embodied; her internal conflict from corporate hollowing to rediscovered joy is earned through concrete actions like shaking hands and patient setup. The change is credible with visible cost in the fragment's darkening and her chest uncurling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Plot accumulates texturely to a resonant reconfiguration where the district remembers joy; closure lands with cost as the fragment darkens. Orientation is immediate, and the accumulative lens holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is integral, with fog and ruined orchard constraining the light projection and charging the final image of remembered happiness. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes are Mira's internal joy; escalation occurs through her agency in projecting light, leading to a cost in the fragment's sacrifice and her emotional renewal. Under accumulative lens, density increases to a decisive reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of joy passed through memory and art emerges from particulars like the fresco and knowledge network; ending offers a non-literal answer in the daydream across centuries without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is consistently lyrical and character-specific, with POV stable and perception filtered through Mira's artistic sensibility; prose rhythm supports emotional beats without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density, no artifacts or loops; figurative language is controlled and enhances clarity, especially in peak beats like the dancer lifting off the wall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the synthesis of light painting, fog-bound district, and emotional arc; the concept feels inevitable and fresh, with risk in lyrical prose that heightens stakes.</comment>
