<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Characterization is precise and embodied, with clear motivation and micro-choices, but lacks internal contradiction or a transformative arc, holding it just below the 9.0 threshold despite strong execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly; closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the cost of endless calculation is legible in the final line, "already calculating tomorrow's performance."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and integral; the tidal arcade and bishop chess piece charge the final image and mirror the thematic tension between natural rhythm and human control, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an accumulative lens, stakes escalate through density of detail and the performance’s progression; the cost of perpetual calculation is present but subtle, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of orchestrated serendipity emerges organically from concrete action and image; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, merging analytical precision with rhythmic flow that mirrors the tide; perceptual signature is strong and elision is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and flawless; no loops or artifacts; figurative language is controlled and enhances clarity, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar themes through a specific, grounded protagonist and setting; the concept of "orchestrated serendipity" feels inevitable and integral, with risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
