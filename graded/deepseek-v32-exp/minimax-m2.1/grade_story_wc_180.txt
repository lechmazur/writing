<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's feisty stubbornness and regret are embodied through concrete actions (carrying the ribbon, repairing the eye) and micro-choices under pressure. Her final realization and rise to meet the young woman are earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the memory of her daughter's stopped reaching. Interiority avoids stock phrasing; contradictions (pride vs. need for help) act simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the door opens and Mira moves toward the young woman, with cost legible in the ribbon's tie and the years of estrangement. Accumulative/textural lens holds via dense reflection and repair, tightening to the epiphany. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory details (amber light, sweet decay, rotting pears) are selective and filtered through Mira's POV. The cathedral-orchard setting charges the final image (moonlit trees, opened door) and mirrors internal states. The bag's tools and ribbon function as micro-settings that constrain choice and deepen closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mending broken promises and relationships) escalates under an accumulative lens via Mira's agency in repair and epiphany. Cost is unmistakable in the daughter's absent reach and the ribbon's offering. One meaningful tightening—the realization that tools alone cannot mend—forecloses options and reweights the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of deciduous vows and generational wisdom emerges from particulars (orchard imagery, father's tools, ribbon) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the tied ribbon and opened door. Epiphany is earned by concrete struggle, though slightly explicit, it remains integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature that reflects Mira's mind. Syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional pressure (e.g., "aching knees," "feisty heart stuttered"). No head-hopping; purposeful compression and elision are taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("deciduous vows," "fallen stars") is consistent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the repair and decelerates at epiphany. No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of repair, generational wisdom, and natural decay feels inevitable. The quartz-eye mender and cathedral-orchard setting are organic, not checklist-driven. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
