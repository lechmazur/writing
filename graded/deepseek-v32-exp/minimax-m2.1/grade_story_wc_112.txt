<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kira's motivation is clear and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure driving the experiment. However, internal contradiction is minimal, and the obliging trait is more backstory than active crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual cost as Kira proves time moves sideways, reshaping research. Causal lens holds tightly from setup to confirmation, and twilight convergence provides persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integral, with the magnetic nexus and lever constraining choices and charging the final image of simultaneous existences. Sensory details are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through Kira's agency under causal pressure; the cost of proving the hypothesis is legible in the final reconfiguration of understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sideways time emerges through concrete observation without moralizing; the ending image of beating wings offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature blending technical and poetic elements; ARIA's dialogue is functional but minimal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or artifacts that harm clarity, and figurative language serves the moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of sideways time through alien metamorphosis is fresh and specific; the synthesis of mechanic and scientist roles feels organic and inevitable.</comment>
