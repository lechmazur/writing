<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Yara's characterization is deep, with clear motivation rooted in past trauma and her gift; her decision to unseal is earned by internal conflict and plants' urgency, shown through concrete micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal plot tightens from gift to discovery to decision; closure with Yara committing to unseal charges future transformation, cost felt through mother's memory and embryo's pulse, lens held consistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid setting in greenhouse and volcanic aftermath; environment constrains choice with kite and script, charging final image of sun breaking through ash as plants calm, though hot springs are less integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes of evolving tradition escalate through plants' screaming and script decoding; Yara's agency drives escalation to unseal chamber, with cost in dangerous transformation, under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of evolving tradition emerges through concrete actions and images; subtext in plants' recognition and kite's symbols, ending with resonant promise without moralizing, offering non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV filtered through Yara's plant-perception; voice distinct with lyrical rhythm, dialogue natural and goal-driven, perceptual signature consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of plant telepathy, amber embryo, and volcanic reconstruction; feels inevitable and fresh, with risk-taking in magical realism that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
