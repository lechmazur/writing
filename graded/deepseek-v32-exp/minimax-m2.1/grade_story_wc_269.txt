<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices (stopping/starting tapping) revealing motivation. The final shift to new tapping is earned by prior causality, though contradictory impulses are not actively in scene, capping at 8.8-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the final image of the station "anchored yet floating." Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of climate change shapes the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The monitoring station and atlas page function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's expertise, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, escalation occurs via pattern break (unexpected data) and cadence shift (new tapping). Protagonist agency drives the deepening, with cost felt in the reconfiguration of her understanding, though not viscerally stark.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images (atlas, tapping, bleaching) and culminates in a resonant, non-literal answer: paths transform, ecosystems are "periodically eternal processes." No moralizing; subtext is rich.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable, with a distinct lyrical-scientific voice. Perception is filtered through Elara's expertise; rhythmic prose mirrors tapping. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and varied sentence structures. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of climate change, monitoring, and personal cartography; the quiet, contemplative plot takes risks that pay off in a specific, inevitable-seeming closure.</comment>
