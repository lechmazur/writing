<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's guilt and hesitation are embodied through concrete sensory details and micro-choices; her final decision to warn the valley is earned by the epiphany triggered by touching the illustration, with visible cost in the release of swallowed truth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as Mira, having internalized forgiveness, stands ready at her post; cost is legible in the lightened heart that carries the weight of past error.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mountain weather station and botanical illustration are indispensable constraints that pressure choice and charge the final image; sensory details (wind, auroral light, copper taste) are selective and filtered through Mira's professional and emotional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Mira's ability to perform her duty despite guilt) tightens through her agency—touching the smudge triggers a realization that reweights options; cost is felt in the swallowed truth finally settled.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness and certainty emerges through particulars (illustration's smudge, swaying antenna metaphor); ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: truth can be held gently, not swallowed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature that mirrors Mira's state; prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, and purposeful elision (the unheard word) pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmically varied, with high information density and no loops or scaffold; figurative language ("curtain of pale grief," "swallowed truth") is consistent and clarifies rather than muddles peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle terminology, botanical illustration, and auroral sorrow transforms a familiar isolation premise; specific details (fault tolerance, data margins) feel organic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
