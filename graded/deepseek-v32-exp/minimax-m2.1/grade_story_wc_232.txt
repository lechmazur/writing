<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's characterization is concrete and motivated, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. Her final decision is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (rising water). The trait "empirically intuitive" is demonstrated, not just labeled, guiding her actions. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summary weakens the peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal linkages are tight and orientation is immediate. Closure is a Decisive Change with Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she steps through the doorway; cost is legible in the rising creek touching her ankles. The persistent constraint of time pressure shapes tactics. The lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, filtered through Maren's expertise. The blooming cavern and rising creek constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details (wet stone, pale flowers, glimmering metal) are woven into action and reflect urgency. Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding home) is signaled early and tightens via the rising creek, a meaningful escalation under the causal lens. Protagonist agency drives each beat; the cost is unmistakable on the page. The final choice forecloses safety with visible, urgent pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars—maps, promises, doorways—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the search for home. Subtext operates through image and implication (the doorway of decisions). No thematic echo or summary in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in cartography. Voice is lyrical yet precise, modulating with pressure. No head-hopping; all perception is filtered through Maren's knowledge and intuition. Rhythmic control supports urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and polished, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the rising creek. The final image is clear and charged, free of artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of map lore, magical realism, and personal quest feels inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific details (type foundry chip, ants). Risk-taking in quiet magical realism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The emotional truth is specific and grounded.</comment>
