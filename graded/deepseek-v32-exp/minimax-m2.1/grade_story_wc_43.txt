<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is vivid and consistent, with embodied emotion and clear motivation rooted in her diagnosis. Her serenity is earned, and micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values, though contradictory impulses are not strongly active in the scene, limiting peak complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. Orientation is clear within 120 words; the cost of mortality is legible in the final image, and the broken record as a persistent constraint shapes Elara's tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and integrated, with the broken vinyl record charging the final image as a "small golden moon." Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's professional and personal priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through quiet interaction under the accumulative lens. Elara's agency drives the deepening; the cost of her limited time is felt, and the final moment reweights the dominant stake with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions, with rich subtext in the humming and objects. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of finding the sacred in the ordinary, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a lyrical, serene quality that matches Elara's POV. Perceptual signature is strong; no head-hopping or register drift; dialogue (minimal) feels natural and goal-driven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and executed with specificity; the combination of hospice setting, ordinary objects as instruments, and the focus on a flawless goodbye feels organic. The final image reconfigures prior material with inevitability.</comment>
