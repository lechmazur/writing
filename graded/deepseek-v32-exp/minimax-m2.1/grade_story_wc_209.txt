<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her persistence and culminating in an earned realization. Interiority is concrete through embodied perception (e.g., "laughed softly in the amber glow"). However, no contradictory impulses act in scene, limiting the internal conflict; the final transformation is well-motivated but lacks the layered tension required for the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with undeniable cost: Mira's revelation reconfigures her art and understanding, a Conceptual Repricing under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The hidden window layers, signaled early, shape tactics and payoff. Orientation is immediate; causality tight from question to discovery. Persistent constraint (the window) charges the ending image with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and essential: the amber pavilion and cathedral window constrain choice and directly enable the climax. Sensory details (slanted October light, ice crystals like diamonds) are filtered through Mira's POV. The environment charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Accumulative lens: her months of study intensify the stakes, culminating in the window discovery that reweights her quest. Cost is legible in the transformed mural and the insight into "secret flourishing." One meaningful tightening suffices, with clear on-page price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—night-blooming flowers, hidden layers—culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer about patience and unseen beauty. Subtext operates through imagery; no moralizing. The final image reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: the prose reflects Mira's artist sensibility through lyrical, selective observation. Voice modulates with emotional beats (e.g., "laughter softly"). No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density, advancing story and atmosphere. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated; no loops or scaffold obscuring clarity. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, supporting the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mural art, botanical mystery, and architectural hidden knowledge feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry. The premise is transformed through specific, grounded details that charge closure.</comment>
