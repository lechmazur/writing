<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character is consistent and motive clear, but lacks internal contradiction or visible cost; the final endurance is earned but feels weightless due to minimal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with subtle cost in the borrowed heartbeat and fleeting mirages. Orientation is immediate and pattern taught.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory description filtered through POV; the prism parapet charges the final image, but does not actively constrain choice, capping just below 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are subtle and escalation gentle under the accumulative lens; agency drives the turn but cost is not legible on the page, limiting pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of possibility emerges organically through image and act; final reconfiguration offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is strong and elision purposeful, though density occasionally flattens immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative with controlled rhythm; minor overwriting in peak beats (“like smoke finding its way”) but no loops or clarity harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept of a mirage painter using coded lullabies is fresh and organic; synthesis feels inevitable, though emotional depth is secondary to atmosphere.</comment>
