<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The guardian's interiority is concrete and her silent empathy is embodied through patient actions; the boy's pain is shown, not told, and their non-verbal exchange carries weight. The final charged poise is earned by her prior suffering and choice to stay.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds cleanly; orientation is immediate; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with felt cost in the shared gaze and flickering light, and the half-spoken secret of continuity lands without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, rain, and warehouse shutters are not just backdrop—they enable the light-weaving and charge the final image. The dental mirror as a micro-setting constrains choice and carries backstory, elevating specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes (hope vs. despair) escalate through the guardian's deliberate light patterns, tightening via the boy's dawning attention. Cost is legible in the suspension of his hopelessness against her patient calm, foreclosing a path of isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of silent empathy and transmitted hope emerges entirely through image and action; the final constellation of stars offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing, reweighting prior pain into possibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, patient voice that modulates with the accumulative rhythm. Perception is filtered through the guardian's silent wisdom, and elision (the unspoken secret) pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with varied sentence rhythms that mirror the spiraling calm. No loops or artifacts; figurative language ("teach darkness the value of stars") is integrated and sharp, and the final image propels the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The concept of a mute guardian using a dental mirror to weave light patterns is strikingly original; the synthesis of silence, empathy, and celestial imagery feels inevitable and fresh, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
