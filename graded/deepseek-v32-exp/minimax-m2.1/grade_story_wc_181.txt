<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictions (bewilderment vs. duty) acting simultaneously. Her final inquiry and the resulting "brightened disquiet" are earned by prior causality—the inherited cameo and her grandmother's inscription—and carry visible cost. The backstory is anchored in present stimuli (the cameo) and tilts her stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens held throughout, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the cameo reveals its image. Cost is legible in "brightened disquiet" and the weight of inherited truth. Orientation is clear within 120 words (Mira in orchard, then bathroom). Closure lands on-page with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (orchard, asteroid, bathroom) and object (cameo) are vividly specific and constrain choice—the bathroom seals against radiation, the cameo directs the inquiry. Sensory details (humming fruit, fluorescent light) are selective and filtered through Mira's professional and emotional priorities, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (inheriting truth) escalates through Mira's agency under the Accumulative lens—her whispered question triggers the cameo's activation. Cost is felt as "brightened disquiet" and the burden of forbidden knowledge. One meaningful tightening (the inquiry) forecloses her prior state of bewilderment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of nonlinear inheritance and forbidden knowledge emerges from particulars (cameo, inscription, orchard) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the cameo's image, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates through implication (e.g., "simply complicated" legacy).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and close, with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, precise, and reflective of Mira's curator mindset. Voice modulates with emotional intensity (e.g., "brightened disquiet"). No head-hopping; elision (e.g., inheritance explained) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no repetitive loops or scaffolding. Figurative language ("time moved like honey through a sieve") is purposeful and consistent. Minor abstraction in one backstory passage does not obscure causality or closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (asteroid orchard, nonlinear inheritance, memory-fruit) feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes (curator, inherited duty) are transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking (lyrical accumulation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Closure image is singular.</comment>
