<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deep and motivated, with embodied emotion and clear micro-choices. Her final stance of tired hope is earned by her backstory and the on-page interaction with the soldier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost under an accumulative/textural lens. The structure is tight, orientation immediate, and the persistent constraint of the misaligned harp shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The gorge, harp, and tooth are integral, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are vivid, selective, and filtered through Mira's professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through Mira's agency in using the harp and song. The cost—her perennial ache and the soldier's release—is legible on the page, tightening the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of integrating laughter into grief emerges through specific events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density, varied rhythm, and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and serves the accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The concept of a soul collector using a misaligned harp is a fresh, specific synthesis. Execution is organic, with risk-taking in the lyrical style that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
