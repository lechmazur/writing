<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's "carefully resourceful" trait is embodied through specific, high-stakes actions (hiding documents, using the puddle map). Her interiority is concrete under pressure, and her final commitment to distribute the archive is an earned stance crystallization rooted in eleven years of resistance, with a clear cost—the loss of her safe invisibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: audit forces escape, which leads to the lagoon and the archive discovery. Closure is a decisive change (she finds the weapon and commits to action) with a visible cost—the sirens above and the abandonment of her old life. The puddle-map foreshadowing pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The auric lagoon is not just atmospheric; it is the tactical location of the hidden entrance, and Mira must wade through it. The phone booth key as a micro-setting object critically constrains choice and unlocks the closure. Sensory details (warm mineral water, amber-lit streets) are filtered through Mira's urgent, professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving truth) escalates coherently under causal pressure: exposure → sealed archives → one-hour deadline → successful escape and discovery. Mira’s agency drives each turn. The cost is legible on the page in the final threshold moment, listening to distant sirens as she descends into a new, dangerous mission.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Themes of memory, indifference, and revision emerge organically through potent images (the lagoon "stubborn as memory," the stars watching "through every revision"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: invisibility was preparation, and "teaching others to see" reweights the prior struggle without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable, close third-person POV with a perceptive signature fitting an archivist ("read the palimpsest"). Lexicon is consistent and purposefully dense. No head-hopping. A minor deduction for occasional complex syntax that, while voice-motivated, creates slight momentum drag in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly specific, with information doing multiple jobs ("a map suggested by puddle reflections at dusk"). No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("stars like scattered codes") is coherent and supports the theme. Sentence-level propulsion is strong throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The concept of historical revision is transformed through lived, tactile details (hiding testimonies in tax codes, a phone booth key). The synthesis of bureaucratic dystopia with a quiet, resourceful protagonist feels organic and specific. The risk of a quiet, dissemination-focused climax pays off.</comment>
