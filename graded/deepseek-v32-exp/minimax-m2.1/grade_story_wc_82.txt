<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira's grief and craft are deeply intertwined, with embodied interiority like "constant luminescence" and micro-choices under pressure. Her final endurance folding cranes is earned by prior causality, with visible cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Mira continues folding cranes, with cost legible in the final line. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of grief shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral: the floating island tea garden, gem, and crane paper constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (processing grief) escalates through accumulation and density increase under the textural lens. Mira's agency in polishing and folding drives deepening, with cost visible in her enduring act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: grief transformed into craft. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"built containers for what you'd lost"—without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and consistent, e.g., "where grief could hold its breath." Rhythmic control under pressure supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic without loops or scaffold. Figurative language serves theme; sentences advance story with high information density. No artifacts harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of dream recording, detached shadows, and craft feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; emotional truth is specific and fresh.</comment>
