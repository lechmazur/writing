<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Yara’s motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices that earn the final act. However, the absence of contradictory impulses in the moment prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; orientation is immediate; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with on-page cost ("tears freeze upon her cheeks") and a persistent constraint (the wait of ice and music) shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail; the ice cavern actively constrains choice (becoming an instrument) and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certifying wonder) escalates through density increase under the accumulative lens; Yara’s agency drives the tightening, and cost is legible in the frozen tears and transformed cavern.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, and the final image reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with a distinct lyrical and synesthetic perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure and purposeful elision teach and pay off the accumulative pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density, varied syntax, and clear propulsion; no loops or figurative muddle in peak beats; closure image remains sharp and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of synesthesia, ritual, and cosmic stakes; risk-taking in lyrical accumulation heightens coherence; the concept feels inevitable and fully committed.</comment>
