<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Characterization is functional but broad, with community archetypes (Eli, Lena) serving thematic needs rather than deep interiority. Emotional changes are summarized rather than dramatized in scene, lacking contradictory impulses or embodied cost under pressure. The collective transformation is clear but individual motivation remains told.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the community united in the rain; cost of collective effort is legible. Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, holding through pattern of restoration. Orientation is clear early; structure is a single shard with causal links from messages to discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral—floating arches, orchard planet, garden—constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, woven through action. The bell tower and garden function as micro-settings that direct the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (community cohesion vs. survival) escalates through accumulation of messages and restoration work, driven by collective agency under an Accumulative lens. Cost is visible in the labor and overcoming neglect, though individual risk is muted. Final choice (ringing bell) tightens options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of collective hope and renewal emerges organically from restoration beats and the final image of rain and butterflies. Subtext operates through imagery (neglect to bloom) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of what builds family.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person omniscient with a lyrical, consistent voice. Perceptual signature is collective but selective; no head-hopping. No dialogue. Prose rhythm supports the accumulative texture, though distance limits deep individual focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished and lyrical with high information density, no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("stone clouds," "ghost whose presence felt...") is consistent and purposeful. Sentence rhythm varies appropriately; closure image is clear and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesis of ghostly guide, alien orchard, and communal restoration, avoiding cliché through specific setting and accumulative arc. The premise is transformed by grounded details (chalk messages, bell) and a focus on collective effort over individual heroics.</comment>
