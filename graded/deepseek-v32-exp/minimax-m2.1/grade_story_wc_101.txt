<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is consistent and embodied, with clear motivation rooted in her grandmother's legacy, but lacks contradictory impulses in scene, preventing a higher score. Her gentle persistence is shown through actions like midnight runs and bell ringing, and the final choice is earned with visible cost in the community's endurance. Relationships with Mariem and Farouk add depth, but internal conflict is minimal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost under an accumulative/textural lens; the bell ringing reconfigures community hope into intergenerational support with persistent constraints from sanctions. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the drive lens holds throughout, leading to a charged poise where the final image reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices; the terra-cotta arbor and antique bell function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory details like "metal so cold it burned" are purposeful, and the atmosphere of "amplified quiet" supports the theme without generic placeholder description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes of survival under sanctions escalate through Mira's agency, from anonymous donations to the bell declaration, tightening options with visible cost in community scarcity. Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through density increases, culminating in a reconfiguration that forecloses paths of despair.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of intergenerational resilience emerges through concrete images and subtext, such as the bell's ring across silence and the mentorship network. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting loss into continuity with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature filters setting through Mira's grief and determination. No head-hopping, and prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, though dialogue is absent, so evaluation focuses on narrative control and coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with no artifacts; figurative language like "the way water eventually carves stone" is purposeful and clear. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, and information density is high without paraphrase loops or register drift in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in specific synthesis of exile, sanctions, and quiet resistance; tropes are transformed through grounded details like the terra-cotta arbor and midnight runs. Risk-taking in accumulative design pays off in a charged poise that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
