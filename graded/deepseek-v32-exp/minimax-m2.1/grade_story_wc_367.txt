<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character is unified and purposeful, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion, but lacks contradictory impulses in scene, limiting the 9+ quick test. The final endurance (Earned Stasis) is earned and cost is felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant Charged Poise with legible cost ("his burden and his gift"). Accumulative lens holds; orientation is clear early; the constraint of his isolation shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral: the lighthouse and lantern wick constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the keeper's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (safe passage) are clear; escalation via ship arrivals and guiding actions is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens. Cost (isolation, burden) is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (burden/gift of stewardship, joy in solitude) emerges through image and action, not statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the sky smiling back.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctively lyrical, with a strong perceptual signature. Rhythmic control and poetic compression are taught and pay off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmically varied, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of magical realism and lighthouse lore feels inevitable. The concept is fully committed, with specific, irreplaceable details that heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
