<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maren's interior contradiction ("loved the space between knowing and imagining") and embodied emotion under pressure earn her final interpretation; the fisher's grief is concretely rendered through trembling hands and dropped words, and the closure choice (offering continuation rather than closure) arises from prior causality with visible cost in his tears.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; orientation is immediate (geode, Maren, dusk); closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the fisher's tears and Maren's understanding that "both were forms of peace"; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The geode and crater glass constrain choice (amplify perception, enable transliteration) and charge the final image with "iridescent walls held their light steady"; sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, avoiding postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering the son's fate) escalates under accumulative lens via Maren's deepening conjecture; agency drives the tightening when she "pushed deeper" into gaps, leading to a legible cost in the emotional reconfiguration at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and transformation emerges from particulars (seeds, gaps, paths); the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("Some paths don't disappear...") without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the fisher's tears and Maren's professional gloom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable; voice has a distinct perceptual signature ("sea-foam recollectionist," "fractured light") and rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping; elision (e.g., the son's exact fate) is taught and pays off in the final image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language ("words dropped like stones into still water") is consistent and voice-motivated; syntax varies purposefully, maintaining clarity and propulsion through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotional residue, migratory seeds, and geode setting feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; premise is transformed through specific lived detail and moral calculus.</comment>
