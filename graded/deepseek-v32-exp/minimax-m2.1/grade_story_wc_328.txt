<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete and embodied ("breath fogged," "fear and wonder warring"). Her final choice to step forward is earned by prior causality, with a visible cost in embracing the unknown. Slight abstraction in phrases like "frostbitten hope" is voice-consistent and does not undercut the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change (Mira steps into the harmony untamed) and felt cost under a causal lens; orientation is immediate; the arrowhead and phone calls shape tactics. The because/therefore linkage from Amari’s calls to the garden’s transformation is tight and escalates meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice—the gravitationally playful garden forces Mira to float, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her researcher’s POV. The underground garden is indispensable to the plot and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth about Amari’s transformation) escalates via Mira’s agency—her movement deeper, engagement with the phone, and spoken realization tighten options. Cost is legible in her acceptance of the transformed reality, foreclosing her old understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images—bitterness as cosmic joke, harmony untamed—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mira’s step into the transformed garden, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct; prose has a lyrical, precise texture that reflects Mira’s perceptual signature. Dialogue (phone) is natural and advances plot. No head-hopping; rhythmic control under pressure is exemplary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density, varied rhythm, and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere without obscuring causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cryptid research, metaphysical transformation, and unique setting feels inevitable; the concept of "harmony untamed" is fresh and fully integrated. Risk-taking in lyrical abstraction heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure is legible.</comment>
