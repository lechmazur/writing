<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure; her final decision to design the maze is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure lands with Conceptual Repricing via Elara's realization and commitment, cost legible in the imperative to stop disintegration; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and essential—the living bridge garden and halo fragment constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving photographs/understanding time) escalates through accumulative density; Elara's agency drives a meaningful tightening, with cost unmistakable in her tasked resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars of time and memory; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of maze-design, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; lyrical, controlled prose reflects Elara's designer mindset, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle, even in peak beats like the halo fragment vision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes temporal horticulture and metaphysical geometry with fresh specificity; risk-taking in lyric conceptualism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
