<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and her motivation clear, with micro-choices under pressure that align with her role as a grief navigator. The final choice to go north with the woman is earned by prior causality, and the censer foot anchors her physically and emotionally. No contradictory impulses in scene, but the characterization is strong and serves the closure. No slips touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with felt cost in the woman's tears and the image of building "a way through." The accumulative/textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early. The plot is simple but effective, with causality intact and a clean closure unit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the marsh and signal station shaping choice and atmosphere. The bronze censer foot functions as a micro-setting object that constrains Mara's choices and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through her POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is guiding the lost through grief; escalation is driven by Mara's agency in responding to the call and going to meet the woman. Under the accumulative lens, stakes reweight through deepening concept of reverse migration. Cost is legible in the woman's tears and the promise of a rough path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events—grief as geography, reverse migration, raw solace. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext is rich in the phone calls and the censer foot. No thematic echo or drift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice that reflects Mara's perceptual signature. Rhythm and diction are controlled, and the voice supports the accumulative texture. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense, with varied sentence structures and strong imagery. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Information density is high, and the final lines resonate. Read-aloud rhythm is effective.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of a grief navigator using a signal station and midnight calls is fresh and specific. Integration of moon phases, reverse migration, and censer foot feels organic. Emotional truth is specific, avoiding generic templates. A non-obvious synthesis that heightens stakes.</comment>
