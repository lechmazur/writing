<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied; his motivation to find beauty in difficulty drives credible endurance, with micro-choices like pressing the worry stone revealing hierarchy of values. Final stasis is earned by prior causality with visible cost of exile.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the tutor accepts his purpose in silence, with cost legible in the eclipse metaphor. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of exile shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting (magnetic nexus, twilight) and object (worry stone) charge the final image with specificity; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the tutor's precision, and the environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding purpose escalates through density increase in reflection; protagonist's agency in endurance and realization forecloses paths with on-page cost. Under accumulative lens, a single meaningful tightening reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars—eclipse, silence, waiting—without direct statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through image of light revealed, reweighting prior material with hopeful melancholy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is thoughtfully precise, rhythm controlled under pressure, and elision (silence) is taught and paid off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold, figurative language is consistent and purposeful, and sentence-level propulsion aligns with reflective pace without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of chess, magnetism, and exile feels inevitable; specific details anchor emotional truth, and risk-taking in quiet, reflective style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
