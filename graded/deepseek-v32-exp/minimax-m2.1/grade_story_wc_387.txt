<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Yuki's interiority is concrete and contradictory impulses are shown in scene; her final whistle is a micro-choice earned by prior reflection, with visible cost in her smile and descent. However, the characterization leans toward static philosophical insight rather than a decisive change, limiting the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens held; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the convergence of patterns. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of hidden effort shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through Yuki's POV; the parapet, moon paths, and fireflies charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, meeting the 9+ test by constraining choice via atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, escalation through density increase and pattern break; Yuki's agency in whistling reweights stakes with cost legible in her readiness to mend nets. One meaningful tightening suffices, but cost is subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hidden effort emerges organically from particulars; subtext in whistle and nets avoids moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the converging moment of appreciation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, reflecting Yuki's philosophical nature. No head-hopping; rhythmic control supports pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and clear. Sentence-level propulsion varies with scene needs, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of net-mender philosopher feels inevitable; specific details and risk in lyric structure heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation of tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
