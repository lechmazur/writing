<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cyrus's philosophical interiority is concrete and character-particular, with his final choice to step through the doorway earned by his prior unraveling of the gear and the jungle's meaning. The cost of abandoning a stable reality is felt, though his archetypal nature slightly limits individuation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Cyrus realizes the jungle is his mind and steps into the doorway; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through patterned detail, and cost is legible in "no back to return to." Orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mechanical rainforest is vividly specific, constraining choice (the tangle barrier) and charging the final image (doorway of light). Sensory detail is selective and woven through action, fully integrated with POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation builds through density of detail and Cyrus's agency in placing the gear, leading to a tightening that forecloses his old path with visible cost—accepting the jungle as his consciousness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of externalized consciousness emerges organically from concrete images (gear, jungle, hum) and resolves in a non-literal, resonant reconfiguration at the end without moralizing. The final image reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and voice is distinct, lyrical, and philosophically inflected, matching Cyrus's perception. Rhythmic control under pressure and no head-hopping; elision (translocation) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and propulsive with high information density and varied syntax. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; closure image is clear and resonant. Read-aloud rhythm supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of philosophical introspection and surreal mechanical setting feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in abstract concept is grounded in specific detail, and the premise is transformed through character-specific lived experience.</comment>
