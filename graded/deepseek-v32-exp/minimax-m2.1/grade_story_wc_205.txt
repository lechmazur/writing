<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vespera's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with embodied emotion like "burnished sorrow" and the shard teaching her to carry fragments. Her motivation from revolutionary to curator is clear, and her final acceptance of multiplicity is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where seeing the founders as refugees reweights truth and multiplicity; cost is legible in her failed revolution versus quiet work. Accumulative lens holds, orientation is early, and persistent constraint of visible time shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice: mirrors as conduits during temporal storms pressure action, and the baroque asteroid's crystalline walls dissipate energy. The vase shard as a recurring object charges the final image with specificity and purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake in understanding the past escalates through the temporal storm, driven by Vespera's agency in covering mirrors. Cost is on-page in her realization that the revolution failed due to demanding a single story, reconfiguring options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through imagery and event: the complexity of history and value of multiplicity over single narratives. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image of civilization seeing itself as both lost and found, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct perceptual signature: poetic diction filtered through Vespera's "poet's heart," e.g., "visible time pooled like amber honey." Rhythmic control under pressure, no head-hopping, and voice is consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, e.g., "time tore open along the eastern wall." No artifacts obscure clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of visible time, temporal storms, and archaeological dispute feels inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
