<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied interiority and earned change. Her contradiction between survey duty and dream archeology drives the narrative without diagnostic labels, and micro-choices under pressure reveal her values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise, cost felt in the rising tide and carried story. Accumulative lens holds, orientation anchored early, and structure tightens meaningfully with one persistent constraint (tide) shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting vividly constrains choice with the submerged pavilion and rising tide; sensory details are selective and charge the final image through the inkwell and kelp, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding meaning escalates through Maren's agency in retrieving the inkwell; cost is legible in the time pressure and her commitment to unfinished work, under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of absence and unfinished work emerges through particulars like the inkwell inscription; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with stable POV and perceptual signature that filters setting through Maren's expertise and sensitivity; rhythmic control under pressure is evident.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures and no artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and clear, and information density supports propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality lies in the synthesis of climate change, memory, and personal archeology; specific details and risk-taking in quiet reflection heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
