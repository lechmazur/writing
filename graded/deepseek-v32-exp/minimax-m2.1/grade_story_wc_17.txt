<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is clear, rooted in her specific profession and legacy, and intensifies as she discovers Ashworth’s work. Interiority is concrete and character-particular (e.g., “feeling the crackle of centuries”). Her final choice—to continue the work and feel connected—is an Earned Stasis that carries the visible cost of the burden, foreclosing a path of isolation. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional embodiment is strong (“for the first time in years, she did not feel alone”).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building density of memory and connection. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Mira’s realization reconfigures the burden as a thread of continuity, with cost legible in the final image of sketching in the dark. Orientation is anchored within the first paragraph. The lens holds without ambiguity; the pattern of discovery (diaries, negative, diagram) teaches its method and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and deeply integrated, constraining choice (fading light, cold corridors) and charging the final image (ivy’s whispers joining the chorus). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Mira’s professional perception. The environment (the building, the fireplace, the ivy) functions as a crucible that pressures and enables her discovery. Micro-setting (the negative strip) is essential to the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving memory before dissolution) is signaled early and tightens accumulatively as Mira deciphers the diaries and uncovers Ashworth’s chart. Escalation is driven by her agency under the Accumulative lens—each interpretive act deepens the stakes. Cost is visible in the emotional weight of the burden she accepts and the reconfiguration of her solitude. No coincidental resolution; pressure coheres to the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (legacy, memory, connection across time) emerges organically from concrete particulars—the diaries, the negative strip, the diagram. Subtext operates powerfully in the building’s dreams and Ashworth’s final question. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the “thread connecting those who listened.” No moralizing; complexity and ambiguity are preserved in the charged poise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person, closely aligned with Mira’s perception. Voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that remains controlled under pressure (“the walls whispered in languages that might have been Latin or might have been something older”). Perceptual signature is highly specific to her role as a cartographer. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (the diary’s blurred text) is taught and paid off. Rhythm supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and precise, with high information density. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Minor overreach in a few phrases (“the weight of a thousand unremembered names” borders on decorative but is voice-motivated). Overall, propulsion and clarity are excellent, with no artifact harming the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The core premise—a “corridor echo cartographer” in a climate-shifted future—is a fresh, specific synthesis. Tropes of memory and ruin are transformed through grounded, tactile detail (brass lenses, film negatives). Emotional truth and specificity avoid generic templates. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight, born from the established pattern of listening and mapping. Bold risk in the quiet, accumulative structure pays off.</comment>
