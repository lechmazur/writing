<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and embodied, and her final choice is earned by causality, but the absence of on-page contradictory impulses or internal conflict limits the emotional depth and prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost ("hammered repose, forged from months of chaos"); causal lens holds tightly from inciting incident to discovery; orientation is immediate and precise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The harmonic caves and frozen pool are not just backdrop—they constrain Mira's method (reading cracks) and charge the final image of the bloom; sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (refuge) escalates through Mira's agency; the discovery of the spiral and activation of the bloom constitute a meaningful tightening with cost legible in the "months of chaos."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as sanctuary emerges through concrete particulars (stone, ice, bloom); the final line offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting the stone's purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Mira's perceptual signature; voice is distinct and rhythmic, though slightly elevated diction in peak beats prevents a 9+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density; no loops or scaffold; sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the discovery and decelerates into repose, all without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mapkeeper lore, energy beings, and physics of silence feels inevitable; the quiet, introspective ending is a bold risk that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
