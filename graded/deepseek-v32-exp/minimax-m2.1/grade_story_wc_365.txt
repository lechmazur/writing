<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies; interiority is embodied and concrete; final change from seeking external truth to internal acceptance is earned with visible cost in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate; closure is a Conceptual Repricing with legible cost ("the weight of a truth finally set down") and shapes the entire arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and selectively detailed; the repair bay and crane control panel constrain choice and charge the final image, making environment indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering withheld truth) escalates through protagonist agency; one meaningful tightening leads to a cost legible in the acceptance of her wound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from character struggle; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (purpose in liminal mapping) without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; lyrical, introspective voice modulates with pressure and maintains coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically varied, dense, and artifact-free; figurative language ("cognitive wind") serves clarity and momentum, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes sensory mapping and parallel universes with specificity; risk-taking in lyrical sci-fi heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
