<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies from crisis actor to historian of small gestures, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. Her final action—spelling "beginning"—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in the "luminous absence." No contradictory impulses in scene, but her endurance and renunciation are credible and rooted in consistent traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing) with felt cost in the "waiting was a kind of hope." Orientation is clear early; the accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with patterns building to a decisive change. The closure unit lands on-page with undeniable conceptual cost, and the structure is tightly woven with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the whispering gallery enables the walking patterns and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Mira's POV, with the chessboard and dome integral to atmosphere. The environment shapes tactics and reweights the stake at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving memory) escalates under the accumulative lens through density increase and pattern breaks. Mira's agency in walking patterns and releasing sound forecloses a path with cost legible in the "absence." One meaningful tightening reweights options, driven by protagonist choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—loss, memory, hope—without direct statement. Subtext operates through images like the chessboard and gallery, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Earned wisdom arises from concrete experiences, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: poetic, reflective voice and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; purposeful compression and elision are taught early and pay off at closure. Diction remains within Mira's lexicon, enhancing texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive, and closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-crisis survival with unique concepts like whispering gallery and crisis actor. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded details; emotional truth avoids generic templates. Risk-taking in structure and language heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
