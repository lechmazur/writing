<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority and earned stasis in her role as witness. However, lacking contradictory impulses in scene slightly limits the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a charged poise with felt cost (the harmonica's note and waiting phone), orientation is immediate, and the accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early; escalation is accumulative through deepening density, driven by Mira's agency, with cost legible in her acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of cultivated estrangement emerges organically from particulars; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is lyrical and consistent, supporting the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density, varied syntax, and no loops or figurative muddle; rhythm supports the textural buildup.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and specific, synthesizing elements into an inevitable whole; risk-taking in quiet structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
