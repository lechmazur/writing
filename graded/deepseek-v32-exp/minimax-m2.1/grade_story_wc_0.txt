<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's scientific interiority and contradictory struggle with gentle decay are concretely embodied; her final renunciation of dramatic narratives is earned by the butterfly's death and the dust pattern, with visible cost in the lingering "golden fingerprint" on her consciousness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the final image of dust patterns reweights her understanding of endings with felt cost—the liberation from needing significance—anchored in the on-page realization "both the supernova and the butterfly were simply ways that matter rearranged itself."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Storm-damaged greenhouse is vividly specific and filters through Mira's POV, but while it supplies the crucible for her epiphany, it does not actively constrain a choice; the butterfly's dust and the rosemary bush more directly charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation builds through density of imagery (butterfly's death, dust transfer, pattern spread) that reweights the stake—her need to witness properly—with clear cost: the burden of dramatic narrative is shed, leaving "kindled humility."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the juxtaposition of cosmic and gentle decay; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the concrete image of dust patterns, reweighting prior material without moralizing, anchored in Mira's earned insight about "magnificence in what did not explode."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, blending scientific lexicon with poetic precision; perceptual signature is strong (e.g., "light curves" vs. "golden fingerprint"), and rhythmic control under pressure supports the accumulative drive without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without scaffold or loops; figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "bruised purple of clearing storm clouds"); sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with the reflective pace, and the closing line lands with resonant clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of astrophysics and mundane decay feels inevitable; the risk of a quiet, reflective epiphany pays off with specificity and emotional truth, transforming the familiar "scientist learns humility" trope through unique imagery and conceptual repricing.</comment>
