<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's guilt and technical-artist identity are concretely embodied (charcoal-fingered, memory), and her final choice to paint is earned by the on-page realization of her past suppression. The closure choice carries visible cost: the rectification of harm she caused. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains specific and contradictory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear within 120 words. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building through sensory and emotional density to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mira kneels to begin painting. Closure lands with felt cost ("rectify the harm my silence had caused") and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The subterranean crystal cave is indispensable: it filters light into "auroral sorrow," mirrors the sister's artistic vision, and constrains the final choice by housing the unfinished painting. The environment charges the closure image with prismatic shadows and mineral taste, directly shaping the revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncorking suppressed creativity) is signaled early and tightens through Mira's descent and confrontation with the painting. Escalation is driven by her agency under the textural lens; cost is legible in her acknowledgment of harm caused. One meaningful deepening reweights options at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (the lock, the unfinished portrait, the cave) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: Mira's act of beginning reweights creativity, guilt, and sisterhood. Subtext operates in gesture and image, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature (mnemonic detail, technical-artist filtering). Voice is consistent and poetic, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; elision (the sister's death) is taught early and paid off in the cave revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical, with varied rhythm and sentence structure. Information density is high; figurative language ("prismatic tears," "auroral sorrow") is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; line-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mnemonic gift, subterranean art cave, and sisterly guilt feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyric density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the closure image is fresh and memorable.</comment>
