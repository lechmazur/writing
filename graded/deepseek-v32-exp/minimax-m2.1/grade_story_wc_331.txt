<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Miriam’s characterization is consistent and her motivation—dedication to analog memories—drives the ritual choice. However, interior contradiction is not dramatized under pressure, and the final choice, while earned, lacks a visible personal cost, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the scarf’s reawakening; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds. Orientation is clear early. Cost is conceptual (fulfillment of purpose) but felt in the glowing scarf image. Lacks a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The hyperbolic library is vividly specific and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ quick test. However, due to the global 9+ gate (Q2 not ≥9.0), the score is capped. Sensory detail is selective and purposefully filtered through Miriam’s POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving analog memories) escalates through Miriam’s agency in performing the ritual. Cost is legible in the scarf’s transformation. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a density increase, but the pressure remains mild and lacks a tightening of options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of analog memories emerges organically from concrete details and the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing. The scarf’s reawakening reweights prior material without statement, though the concept is slightly explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, slightly academic tone that matches Miriam’s expertise. No head-hopping; voice modulates with emotional intensity. Dialogue (brief) is natural and reverent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and legible. Minor abstraction in phrases like “geometry of imagination” does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concept of a hyperbolic library housing analog memories is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of mathematical and poetic ideas. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates. Capped due to Q2 not meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
