<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies, embodied in actions like clutching the wildflowers. However, interior contradiction is minimal; she lacks conflicting impulses in scene, which prevents a 9+ score. The final understanding is earned, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally contradictory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from whale beaching to memory chamber. Closure lands with felt cost: the pulse of warmth in the wildflowers as Mira touches the crystal reconfigures her role. Orientation is anchored early, and the gravity pockets provide a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the salt crystal chamber's fluctuating gravity dictates Mira's path. Sensory details like "gleaming silence" and "salt crystallizing" are filtered through her POV, charging the final image where crystals capture memories.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding deleted memories) escalates through Mira's agency: using coffee grounds, entering the densest pocket. Cost is legible in the emotional weight of her mother's memory. One meaningful tightening—approaching the central crystal—forecloses other options under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and grief emerges organically through images like wildflowers as a map and salt from tears. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with Mira's role as "lantern lighter of forgotten things," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is clear in Mira's attention to patterns in coffee grounds and gravity. No head-hopping; prose rhythm modulates with pressure, e.g., short sentences in climax like "She reached out."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language ("memories spilled like luminescent fragments") is consistent and purposeful. Information density high, advancing story and atmosphere without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of concepts (gravity pockets, deleted memories, lantern lighter) feels inevitable and organic. Risk-taking in mystical elements heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity in details like pressed wildflowers transforms familiar tropes.</comment>
