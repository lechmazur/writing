<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Deep interiority and embodied emotion anchor her ancient stillness; final earned stasis is credible but lacks on-page contradictory impulses, keeping it below 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (earned stasis) with cost legible in "weathered and ancient as the bones"; pulse constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining her immobility and charging the final image; sensory details like "dust had learned her shape" are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation through density of observation tightens to spiritual realization; agency in her attention drives stakes with visible cost in endured centuries.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from her practice; ending reweights navigation as spiritual understanding without moralizing, offering resonant subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with perceptual signature tuned to ripples and resonances; POV is stable and apt for contemplative mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without loops or scaffold; figurative language coheres, and sentence-level propulsion matches her paced awareness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ancient navigator concept; risk in quiet, accumulative design pays off with inevitable feeling and emotional specificity.</comment>
