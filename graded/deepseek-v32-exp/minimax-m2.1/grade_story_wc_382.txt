<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's motivation sharpens from curiosity to necessity with embodied interiority; her final renunciation ("I don't need to know") is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in the charged poise of the ending. The tutor is consistently enigmatic, and contradictory impulses act in scene during Elena's interrogation and subsequent acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds tightly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with cost legible in "the buildings exhaled." Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the pattern of deepening mystery leads inevitably to Elena's stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting functions as character: the building's grammar and the rooftop garden during the meteor shower charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, with the desk seal and atmospheric details constraining choice and enriching thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding why she was drawn) escalates under accumulative lens via density increase; Elena's agency in interrogating then accepting forecloses a path with felt cost. One meaningful tightening occurs during the meteor shower beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars of language, lies, and architecture; subtext operates through gesture and image. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through Elena's acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is literary and consistent, modulating with emotional intensity. Dialogue carries subtext, and narrative distance remains controlled, supporting the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, accelerating pressure toward closure. No artifacts obscure causality or dull the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Concept of a dead language tutor teaching the syntax of buildings is fresh and non-obvious; synthesis feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical, accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
