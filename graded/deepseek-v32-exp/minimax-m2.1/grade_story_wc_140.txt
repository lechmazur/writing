<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Characterization is vivid through concrete interiority and embodied emotion; the nameless one's motivation to collect fragments is clear and roots their endurance. The final choice to continue despite erasure is earned by the death-certificate error and accumulated understanding, with visible cost in survival. However, contradictory impulses are not dramatized in scene, limiting peak emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure is a charged poise (moving deeper into the labyrinth) that reconfigures survival with legible cost. Orientation is anchored within 120 words, and the mosaic shards cohere without causality breaks. The persistent constraint of erasure shapes tactics and the final image, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the container labyrinth constrains choice by enabling overheard stories, and the tidal rhythm charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the POV’s perception. The label as a recurring object actively reweights meaning, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving memory against erasure) escalates under the accumulative lens via density increase—the label discovery and dockworker’s story deepen understanding. Agency is demonstrated through the choice to continue collecting, foreclosing surrender with felt cost. One meaningful tightening suffices, though agency is more responsive than proactive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from fragments and images, resisting moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of continued survival. Subtext operates in the label as evidence of choice and the tides as rhythm of memory. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct—lyrical, rhythmic, and reflective of the nameless one’s perception. Dialogue with the dockworker is natural and advances plot. No head-hopping; purposeful compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts; figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere seamlessly. The closure image is clear and uncluttered by line-level issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and synthesizes erased histories, container labyrinth, and accumulative memory into an organic whole. Risk-taking in abstract characterization and lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with emotional specificity avoiding templates.</comment>
