<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied; motivation clear and intensifies to compel stance change. Final acceptance earned through prior causality with visible cost in trembling hands and accordion holding. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens held throughout; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in the final image of river flooding without apology. Orientation anchored early; no causality breaks; persistent constraint of past and station shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting vividly specific and constrains choice: station ivy, graffiti, and accordion bellows charge the final image. Sensory detail selective and purposeful, filtered through POV; environment mirrors internal states and pressures realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of self-forgiveness escalates via accumulative deepening from graffiti wisdom and reflection; protagonist's agency in attention drives reweighting with cost legible in acceptance of flooding without apology. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like graffiti phrases and accordion tape; subtext operates through image and implication. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; earned wisdom from concrete experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is methodical and reflective, matching character's mindset. No head-hopping; purposeful compression in reflection interleaved with present action. Rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied sentence rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language integrated ("ivy like green veins"); information density high; closure image clear without muddle. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of river chronicler, abandoned station, and graffiti wisdom feels inevitable; specific details create freshness without gimmickry. Emotional truth specific; risk-taking in quiet introspection heightens stakes. Transformation of tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
