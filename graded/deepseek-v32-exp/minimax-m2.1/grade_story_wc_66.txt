<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, embodied through her meticulous actions and the risk of her secret work. However, the characterization lacks on-page contradictory impulses or flaws that complicate choices under pressure, limiting emotional depth. Her steadfast dedication is compelling but reduces internal conflict, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mira continues her "quiet revolution" with cost legible in the patrol risk and dust's memory. Orientation is early and clear; the persistent constraint of the hidden radio and dust shapes tactics, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly selective and pressures choices: the ember alcove and mist create atmosphere, while the radio and dust function as micro-settings that constrain action and charge the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through Mira's POV, and the environment actively shapes her broadcast decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving stories) escalates through Mira's agency in broadcasting and teaching dust, with cost visible in the need to hide the radio's glow. Under the accumulative lens, pressure tightens via density increase and cadence shift, though without a direct reversal, keeping it just below the 9-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—memory, resistance, and renewal—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mira's continued revolution, and subtext operates via elusive song lyrics and dust's memory, earning the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Mira's lyrical, meticulous voice controls rhythm and diction. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., dust's memory) is taught and paid off. The prose reflects her character under pressure, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied sentence rhythm and no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent; information density is high without obscuring causality. Read-aloud ear test passes, and closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is highly original—story famine, pirate broadcaster, remembering dust—synthesized into an inevitable, specific vision. Risk-taking in quiet lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the concept commits fully, transforming familiar tropes through grounded detail.</comment>
