<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (loving a changeling while knowing he is not her own) are embodied in scene; her final forgiveness is earned by the ritual and reflection, with cost visible in the "cleft in certainty." No diagnostic label-speak; interiority is concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing) as the tooth's light maps "new constellations," reweighting the fracture with felt cost. Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Secret garden and changeling's tooth are micro-settings that charge the final image; sensory details are selective and filtered through Elara's memory. The garden's wild growth and the fountain's channels constrain the ritual's outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (emotional closure) escalates through Elara's agency in placing the tooth, leading to a density increase and pattern break (constellation patterns). Cost is legible in her forgiveness and the transformed light.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of fractures as windows emerges organically through the tooth, garden, and constellations; ending offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct perceptual signature and lyrical, nostalgic rhythm; voice remains stable under pressure. No head-hopping; elision (the ritual's mechanics) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with the reflective tone. Closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of changeling folklore with a mother's perspective; the ritual and constellation mapping feel inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet, reflective structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
