<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elena's interiority is concrete and contradictory (certainty vs. curiosity), embodied in her response to the garden and coin. Her final choice to "complete a conversation" is earned by prior causality—the coin's discovery and its acoustic effects—with visible cost in exchanging certainty for curiosity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; pattern of echoes and coin's influence builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands on-page with cost: "exchange certainty for curiosity." Orientation is clear early; the garden's design as a persistent constraint shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vividly specific, constrains choice (timing brushwork to echoes), and charges the final image. The hobo nickel functions as a micro-setting object that alters perception and tactics, indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is driven by density increase (coin's effect, layered awakenings) and protagonist agency. The stake—certainty vs. curiosity—tightens meaningfully, with cost legible in the final exchange.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (echoes, coin, fresco) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: restoration becomes dialogue, reweighting prior material through the image of the listening musician and garden's sound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV, stable and distinct; voice is lyrical, precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors the garden's acoustics. Perceptual signature is character-specific (restorer's eye, sensitivity to sound); no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("like light bending through water"). No artifacts obscure causality or closure; information density is high throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mural restoration, acoustic garden, and Depression-era artifact feels inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet, internal arc pays off with emotional specificity; the core premise is transformed through grounded, irreplaceable detail.</comment>
