<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's curiosity and diligence are concretely embodied through observational actions and micro-choices under pressure, but the character lacks internal contradiction or a meaningful change with visible cost, keeping the score strong but not exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure lands as a Charged Poise with Mira's realization, and orientation is clear early. However, the cost is mild (exhaustion) and no persistent constraint shapes tactics, limiting the score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (porthole, creaking timbers) and the hopscotch board as a key object charge the final image, though the setting does not heavily constrain choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through Mira's agency in noting patterns and discovering correlations, with a visible cost in her exhaustion, but stakes remain intellectual without high personal tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from patterns and marginalia, with a resonant, non-literal answer in the final image of secrets captured in old objects, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature reflective of Mira's curiosity; brief dialogue is natural and advances the plot without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with strong rhythm and high information density, though occasional figurative language ("like a living shadow") leans decorative without harming clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of airship, starlings, hopscotch board, and navigational discovery feels fresh and inevitable, with specificity that avoids template plots.</comment>
