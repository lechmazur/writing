<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's internal contradiction—practicing inherited signs yet feeling she doesn't understand—acts in scene. Her final, unplanned signing to Elena is a decisive choice earned by prior causality (grief, practice, the old man's guidance) with visible cost in Elena's crying and her own "joyful sorrow." Interiority is concrete and embodied, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Marina's spontaneous signing reconfigures silence into shared music, with cost legible in Elena's tears and the old man's departure. The lens holds via patterned intensification of silence, translation, and memory. Orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The luminous harbor and the vintage camera function as micro-settings that charge the final image. The camera, a recurring object, concretely constrains the theme of unrecorded memory and is essential to the closure. Sensory detail ("shattered silver," "lap of waves") is selective, vivid, and filtered through Marina's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is a decisive density increase and cadence shift: Marina moves from practicing folk tales to improvising her grief for Elena, driven by her agency. The cost is unmistakable on-page in the emotional release and recognition, reweighting the dominant stake of translating silence into connection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from particulars—the camera, signing, mapping silence—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: translation is an embodied act of sharing, not capturing. The old man's dialogue approaches thematic statement but is integrated as character-specific advice and paid off in action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature ("moonlight thickening until it felt less like illumination and more like presence"). Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and purposeful compression (e.g., the grandfather's backstory) is taught and pays off. No head-hopping or distance issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("shattered silver," "joyful sorrow") is precise and integrated. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with Marina's signing and breathes at the close. No artifacts obscure causality or dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of sign language, a filmless camera, and mapping silence is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the accumulative, lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through grounded, character-driven detail, avoiding template plots.</comment>
