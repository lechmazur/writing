<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied (copper taste, proprioceptive wrongness). Motivation (mathematics of mercy) intensifies and compels her choice to stop at the clearing. Final Charged Poise is earned by prior causality—her obsession and refusal to remove the strap. Minor deduction: shame about talking is stated more than fully dramatized in subsequent beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly. Orientation is immediate and clear. Closure is a resonant Charged Poise—stopping at the clearing’s edge—with palpable cost in her trembling and the “price she had not yet calculated.” The mask strap as a persistent constraint shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest is a vivid, pressuring environment that dictates her path. The pewter mask strap functions as a micro-setting object that constrains choice (beacon) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through her enhanced, traumatized perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (understanding complicity vs. survival) escalates under the Accumulative lens via deepening realizations and sensory density. Protagonist agency (endurance, attention, choice not to flee) drives the tightening. Cost is legible in her trembling and the uncalculated price awaiting her.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (mercy as unanswered questions, damage disguised as specialness) emerges organically from images and events. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the charged poise. Slight abstraction in the final sentence (“trade the arithmetic of her wounds”) leans toward conceptual statement, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and deeply immersive. Voice has a distinct perceptual signature—lyric, dense, synesthetic—that reflects her traumatized, enhanced consciousness. Syntax and rhythm modulate expertly with emotional pressure. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional line-level craft. Figurative language is consistent, vivid, and purposeful (“anesthesia dissolved like sugar in rain”). High information density with zero loops or scaffolding. Sentence rhythm propels the accumulative pressure. Read-aloud ear test passes flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of enhanced interrogation, bio-augmentation, and metaphysical penance. The perspective is fresh and memorably specific. Risk-taking in the accumulative, lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
