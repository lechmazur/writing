<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("holding it I feel the weight of someone else's obsessions"). The final choice—to continue the work—is an Earned Stasis earned by prior reflection and carries visible cost (isolation, being considered mad). Contradictory impulses (agonizing vs. calming) are present though more reflective than dramatized in immediate scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is an Earned Stasis with felt cost in the narrator's resolve to leave traces. Orientation is clear within 120 words (first-person scholar in flooded harbor ruins). Single-scene structure with reflective shards coheres; the persistent constraint of sediment shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (sunken city ruins) is vividly specific and constrains choice (sifting sediment for evidence); the chronometer cog as micro-setting charges the final thematic image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the narrator's scholarly bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. official narrative) escalates through accumulative density; narrator's agency in choosing endurance forecloses the easy path with cost legible in final paragraph. One meaningful tightening: the realization that work may outlive them reweights the stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars (cog, sediment, logs) without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer through the image of leaving traces. Subtext operates in the narrator's defiant calm.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First‑person POV is stable and distinct, with a scholarly, reflective voice and controlled rhythm. No head‑hopping; perceptual signature is selective and character‑specific. No dialogue present; prose texture supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and precise, with varied sentence rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("like an opened tomb") is purposeful and clear. Information density is high, advancing story and atmosphere without padding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post‑apocalyptic ruins with scholarly obsession; the focus on historical preservation and layered truth feels organic and non‑obvious. Risk‑taking in reflective, quiet narrative heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
