<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The seer's contradictory impulses (fear vs. yearning) are dramatized in her micro-choices, culminating in an earned renunciation of safety for a costly return to her gift. Her mercury-glass nature and nightly reality substitution are embodied constraints, not just labels, and her final choice is rooted in a prior causality of seven nights' consideration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive, resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis in leaving the sanctuary) with legible cost in the pain paired with gratitude. The causal lens holds cleanly from the stone's draw through the keeper's challenge to her crystallized decision to depart, with the lost language stone serving as a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore functions as both sanctuary and crucible, physically constraining her search and its vastness mirroring her internal journey. The stone's feather-texture charges the final image (warm in her pocket) and its tactile quality is a key sensory filter for her POV, making the setting an active participant in the choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the causal lens: the keeper's challenge forces a higher-stakes choice (planting a seed of herself), which she meets after seven nights of internal pressure. The dominant stake (understanding home/accepting talent) tightens meaningfully, and the cost—the sharp pain of remembering—is unmistakable on the page at the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of home as a learned language emerges organically from the seer's struggle with the stone and her buried talent. The keeper's final statement ("The shape of home... is a language you learn to speak") borders on thematic echo but is partially earned by the preceding concrete realization, preventing full abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and close, with a distinct perceptual signature (mercury eyes, glass fingertips) that colors all description. The prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, and purposeful elision (e.g., the specific content of the grandmother's words) is taught early and paid off in the final realization of gratitude.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and highly controlled with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("digestive tract of knowledge," "talent rose like water") is consistent and enhances clarity. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with the beat, and the final paragraph's cadence shift perfectly supports the closure's resonant poise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a mercury-glass seer, a mountain-encompassing bookstore, and a tactile lost language stone feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept (buried talents as a garden) is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting, avoiding cliché and creating a singular artistic stance.</comment>
