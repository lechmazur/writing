<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Seraph's pacifism and emotional journey are clear and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure. The final integration is earned, though the interiority occasionally relies on abstract terms like "shadow work" without fully dramatizing contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (stepping through the dimension) and felt cost (release of grief). Orientation is clear early, and the tear/photographs provide persistent constraints that shape the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric; the recycled ship and photographs are not just backdrop but constrain action and charge the final image with the shimmer and stitching.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal integration) is signaled early; escalation via accumulative density and protagonist agency (stitching) leads to a cadence shift that reweights options with a visible cost—the release of grief into productive light.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of compassion and integration emerges through concrete images and actions; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature; voice is controlled and consistent, and purposeful compression (e.g., "the void that was not void") serves the accumulative pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats, and sentence-level propulsion supports the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi and spiritual concepts feels organic and inevitable; specific, irreplaceable elements (tear, stitching, gravitational quirk) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
