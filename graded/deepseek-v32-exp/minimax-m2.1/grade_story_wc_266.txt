<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is strong with concrete interiority and embodied emotion; the old woman's internal conflict between safety and aliveness is shown through the leash metaphor; her final choice to let go is earned by prior causality; the guides are symbolic but serve the single-POV focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Plot under an accumulative/textural lens builds through imagery to a resonant reconfiguration; closure lands with cost as she sheds the leash and steps onto the path; orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds consistently; the persistent constraint of the leash shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly evoked through selective sensory detail; the leash and ticket punch function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image; the veiled ridgeway provides a metaphorical landscape that pressures her journey; atmosphere supports the theme of transition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start: finding unused courage; escalation occurs through density of imagery and the protagonist's agency, culminating in the leash falling away; cost is legible in her recognition of years choosing safety; the tightening forecloses the option of remaining bound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete images and actions without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of courage; subtext operates through gesture and symbol; the story invites reflection through purposeful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent in single POV; the prose has rhythmic control that heightens pressure without obscuring clarity; perception is filtered through the old woman's consciousness; no head-hopping or distance issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and varied syntax; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; language is precise and evocative, advancing story and character; read-aloud rhythm is natural.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of mythical journey with specific, grounded details like the leash and ticket punch; the story takes risks with its lyrical, metaphorical style that heightens stakes; the emotional truth feels inevitable and earned.</comment>
