<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's claustrophobia and curiosity create credible internal conflict; her final choice to join the network is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in overcoming fear. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure align with motives.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Clear causal lens with tight tidal timeframe; orientation anchored early. Closure is a decisive change on-page—Maren dissolves into the cable network—with felt cost in renouncing return. Persistent constraint (six-hour window) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting of flooded facility and undersea cables pressures choices via tidal deadline and claustrophobic spaces; the codex's gold flecks charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake escalates from retrieval to transcendental choice; pressure tightens through time limit and discovery of voices. Agency drives escalation, culminating in a costly decision that forecloses return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory, connection, and perception emerges through imagery and action, not statement. Ending offers resonant non-literal answer—ocean as library—reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm modulates with pressure. No head-hopping; voice is consistent and character-specific, with purposeful elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive without loops or scaffold; figurative language is controlled and clear. Sentence-level rhythm supports scene needs, and information density is high without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of undersea cables as living memory pathways; specific details like gold flecks and phase transitions transform tropes. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
