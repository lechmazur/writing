<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and motivated, with micro-choices like synchronizing with the flame and stitching new threads; her wisdom disguised as foolishness drives the narrative, and the final endurance is earned with cost felt in the impending coup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate; closure is a Charged Poise under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost legible in the eternal flame and Elara's listening; the candle's persistent constraint shapes tactics, and the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the observatory and eternal candle constraining choice and charging the final image; details are filtered through Elara's POV, integrating atmosphere with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake in unraveling conspiracies is signaled early; escalation is driven by Elara's agency in stitching and listening, with cost unmistakable in the shadows of violence and her vigilant work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through subtext and image—secrecy, truth, resistance—without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in Elara's listening and stitching as acts of defiance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision is taught and paid off in the accumulative pattern, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is elegant and propulsive, with high information density and no loops or artifacts; figurative language is selective and enhances clarity, rhythm supports pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The concept of an embroiderer encoding conspiracies in galaxy charts is a fresh synthesis; risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative approach heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
