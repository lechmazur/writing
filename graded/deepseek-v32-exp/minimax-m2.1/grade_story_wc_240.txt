<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and her realization about "the physics of letting go" is earned through the specific, pressured geometry of the encounter. However, some interior moments edge toward diagnostic label-speak ("the particular physics of letting go"), slightly abstracting the embodied cost. The final charged poise is a credible renunciation/endurance rooted in three years of silent causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is clear and held. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that lands on-page with felt cost: the crack in the man's voice and the "quiet wildfire" illuminate the hidden network. The persistent constraint of maintained separation shapes the final, reconfigured image of intimacy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The bioluminescent mushroom farm is indispensable, its ethereal light filtering perception and literally charging the final image. The environment constrains choice (defining thresholds of interaction) and is fully integrated into action and theme. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purpose-driven through Mira's professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through the careful approach of the figures and the deepening realization of their deliberate architecture of distance. Mira's agency is in her perceptual shift, which forecloses the path of conventional disclosure. The cost is legible in the emotional weight of the unspoken and the cracked voice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of setting, character perception, and action. The central question of connection through maintained separation finds a resonant, non-literal answer in the final image of the "quiet wildfire." Subtext operates powerfully in gesture, silence, and the precise modulation of distance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply fused with Mira's perceptual signature—her way of seeing spatial and human geometries is unique and consistent. The prose texture is distinct and controlled, with rhythmic modulation that supports the accumulative pressure. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and largely effective, with high information density. A minor tendency toward stacked abstraction and figurative language ("the physics of letting go settle into her bones like marrow") creates slight opacity in peak beats, preventing a higher score. No loops or scaffold; momentum is well-maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of intrusion detection, bioluminescent ecology, and the "familiar stranger" dynamic is fresh, specific, and inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, emotionally complex conclusion. Risk-taking in the quiet, perceptual climax heightens meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
