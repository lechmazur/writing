<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's pacifist choice is rooted in concrete memories and embodied emotion; her final realization is earned by the accumulative contrast with her father. Slight tendency toward thematic statement in interiority, but micro-choices under pressure (helping refugees) reveal a consistent hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing ("Peace was not the absence of fire...") that reweights the premise with felt cost. One meaningful deepening occurs with the refugees' arrival, but causal linkages are light—appropriate for the mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and charges the final image (roses against sand); the dome constrains choice and supplies resources. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. Capped from 9.0 due to high-band gate conditions not met.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (does peace matter in chaos?) deepens accumulatively; Mira's agency in tending the garden and aiding refugees forecloses the violent path. Cost is legible in her renunciation, but escalation is quiet and lacks a sharp turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through resonant images (sandbag, roses, sheathing) without moralizing; the ending offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Final paragraph skirts statement but is earned by the pattern.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive voice that modulates appropriately. No dialogue; perceptual signature is strong and consistent. Capped from 9.0 due to high-band gate conditions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied syntax and purposeful imagery. Minor abstract phrasing ("engraved quiet") but no loops or artifacts that obscure closure. Capped from 8.8 due to high-band gate conditions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting with a gardener's quiet defiance; the bounty-hunter daughter trope is transformed through specific, grounded choices. Authenticity of vision elevates the piece.</comment>
