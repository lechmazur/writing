<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure; her final realization is earned by prior causality, though contradictory impulses are more reflective than simultaneous in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in Mira's insight that "every wrong turn was a form of filtering," anchored by the anomaly's constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency in unbending the signal via contingent relationships; cost is legible in her acceptance of past error and the comfort of uncertainty, tightening the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the pen and seeds, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice blends technical precision and lyrical introspection, maintaining rhythmic control and no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and clarity is preserved through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of signal interpretation and gravitational filtering feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet, introspective closure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
