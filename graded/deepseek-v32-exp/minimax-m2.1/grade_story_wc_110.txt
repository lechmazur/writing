<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's interiority is concrete and motivation clear; micro-choices under pressure reveal values. Final choice to engage is earned, though internal contradiction is subtle rather than sharply dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens held; orientation clear. Closure is a charged poise with cost legible in "lens felt suddenly heavier" and the final image of drawing; persistent constraint of unreliable words shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt is vivid and selective, charging the final image with "resonant hush"; micro-setting (counter, tickets) constrains interaction and supports theme of mediated clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake of thawing mistrust escalates through protagonist's agency in ticket exchange; cost is unmistakable in the hand-squeeze and heavier lens, tightening options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of honesty freed from words emerges through symbols and gesture; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Consistent first-person POV with distinct perceptual signature; lyrical, reflective voice controls rhythm and elision, and psychic distance is stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, high-density, and propulsive; no loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh premise of symbolic communication on concert tickets; synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking in quiet, accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
