<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "mouth had become an open wound"). Her final endurance—settling to study—is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in her isolation. However, internal conflict is occasionally told rather than fully dramatized, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with on-page cost ("her truthfulness a quiet rebellion"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds tightly, and orientation is anchored early. Persistent constraints (virus, truthfulness) shape tactics, and the ending reweights stakes without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices (e.g., the orchard's wreckage demands foraging skill). The hollow trunk constrains the final action and charges the image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, fulfilling the 9+ test of environment shaping closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultivating psychological safety) is signaled early and deepens through Mira's reflection. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is via density increase and agency; cost is legible in her rebellion. However, the tightening is subtle, lacking a dramatic turn that forecloses a live option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (orchard persistence, glass eye symbolism). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through image and stance, avoiding moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and silence, reweighting prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical, reflective perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm control heighten pressure (e.g., "fractured but functional"). No head-hopping; all elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density, advancing story and atmosphere. Rhythm varies naturally, and no loops or scaffold obscure closure. Slight label-speak ("radiantly, involuntarily truthful") is voice-motivated but prevents a 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes fresh elements (post-empathy virus, glass eye neurology) with specific, grounded detail. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
