<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eliorn's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a patient, methodical temperament. Interiority is concrete via embodied sensation (aching legs, warm fork) and micro-choices (walking, speaking names). However, no contradictory impulses act in scene; the characterization is single-minded, which precludes the highest band. Final endurance is earned by prior causality with visible physical cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens held cleanly; closure is a Charged Poise—the town begins to hum, Eliorn smiles with two thousand steps left—reconfiguring stakes with felt cost (physical effort, patience). Orientation is immediate; persistent constraint (7,000 footsteps) shapes tactics. Closure lands on-page with unmistakable cost in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through Eliorn’s professional perception; the archway, cobblestones, and tuning fork constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (moss like velvet, vibration in marrow). The environment functions as micro-setting, essential to the revival method.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (restoring shared balance) escalate accumulatively via Eliorn’s repeated footsteps, tightening as the cobblestones begin to buzz. Agency drives escalation; cost is legible in her physical exhaustion and the town’s nascent response. One meaningful deepening (the stones answering) reweights options under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of patient, accumulative revival emerges through concrete action and image, not statement. Subtext operates in the rhythm of footsteps and the town’s silent decay. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the hum of recognition—reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct lyrical, rhythmic voice that mirrors the concept of resonance. Perception is consistently filtered through Eliorn’s expertise; no head-hopping. Diction and syntax are controlled and purposeful, heightening pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density; sentences vary rhythmically to match the accumulative pace. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated (e.g., “moss had worn the stone to velvet”). Closure image is sharp and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a bell tuner reviving a town through resonant footsteps is fresh and specific. The concept is fully committed to, with risk-taking in a quiet, accumulative plot. The integration feels organic and inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
