<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Miriam's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion ("ache she couldn't name") and micro-choices under pressure. Her final decision to find the daughter and consider letting go is earned by the discovery of the note and her prior reflections, with cost in the weight of her searches. The 9+ test is met, though internal contradiction is more summarized than shown in simultaneous impulses within a single beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as Miriam smiles and resolves to deliver the transmission, with cost legible in the "accumulated mass of every search." Orientation is clear early; the inferred hybrid lens (accumulative/textural dominant) holds, and the structure weaves backstory seamlessly into a single, tightening scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice—the wreck's architecture guides her navigation, and the snow globe charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("amber silence," "pages fluttering in slow motion"), filtered through Miriam's professional POV, meeting the 9+ test decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding letting go) is signaled early and escalates through Miriam's agency in retrieving and reading the note, which deepens her knowledge and narrows her options. The cost is felt in the weight of her searches and her decision to act, meeting the 9+ test under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through image and action—the snow globe, the note's message, and the ocean itself explore loss as transformation. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("the light doesn't die. It transforms") without moralizing, and subtext runs quietly throughout.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, analytical voice that reflects Miriam's perception. No dialogue; the narrative stance is consistent, and the prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity. Perceptual signature is strong, and any elision is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of loops or scaffold. Figurative language is precise and integrated ("amber silence," "suspended thoughts"). Sentences vary naturally, advancing story and atmosphere with high clarity and momentum, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of deep-sea exploration, a sunken library, and a snow globe as vessel for a last transmission feels fresh and inevitable. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, and the quiet, reflective tone heightens stakes without gimmickry, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
