<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Conjurer's motivation and interior contradiction are concrete and embodied; her final renunciation (leaving the eyes, accepting loss) is earned by prior patterns with visible cost—the forfeiture of her meaningful-currency purchase. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression is credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with clear on-page cost—she places the glass eyes as an offering and feels the shift to dovetailing with loss. Orientation is immediate, pattern taught early, and payoff lands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cavern orchard, mosaic stepping stones, and dripping stalactites are vivid, selective, and indispensable; the setting constrains choice (method via mosaic) and charges the final image (orchard’s silence, stalactites’ indifference). Sensory detail is POV-filtered and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding ambiguous loss) escalates via accumulative density and a cadence shift; protagonist’s agency in placing the eyes and walking away reweights options with legible cost—the offering and acceptance foreclose the solving path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from images and action; the ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing. Final paragraph edges toward explicit statement but remains earned by prior particulars, reweighting loss and hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (pattern‑seeking, mathematical‑emotional blend). Voice is consistently poetic, syntax and rhythm controlled under pressure; no head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of loops or scaffold; figurative language is pattern‑taught and pays off. Sentence‑level propulsion aligns with scene needs; no overwriting or clarity issues in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of conjurer, cavern orchard, glass eyes, and mathematics of emotion feels inevitable; risk‑taking in lyrical, contemplative style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity and emotional truth are high.</comment>
