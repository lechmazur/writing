<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her calligrapher identity; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion; her final choice to write is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the garden image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) where the room becomes a garden, with cost legible in the final image; orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices; toxic sky and greenhouse domes are woven into action; the zinc plate and map constrain choices and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens; stakes about candor tighten meaningfully through her active pursuit; cost is unmistakable in her writing and the reconfigured room.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of candor emerges organically from particulars like the unsent letters and her师傅's silence; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, reflecting Mira's worldview; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled with high information density; rhythm varies naturally; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of dystopian setting, calligrapher motif, and lost conversations feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
