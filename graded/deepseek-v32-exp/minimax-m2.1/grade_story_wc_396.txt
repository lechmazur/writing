<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—peacekeeper who carries shadows—is concretely embodied; her final choice to use the fragment for understanding rather than repair is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the "weighted breath before reply."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mira understands her purpose, with cost legible in the final paragraph’s "weighted breath" and purposeful exit; the broken fragment shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting (lighthouse orchard, ice floes, vintage store) constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, woven through action and perception, mirroring internal stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding vs. easy peace) escalates under accumulative lens; Mira’s agency—using the fragment to see cracks—narrows options with unmistakable cost in the breath before action and the foreclosed path of simple repair.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (broken fragment, layered mirrors) without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—using brokenness to see more clearly—that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct perceptual signature; lyrical, reflective voice remains stable and modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping, and purposeful elision (the fragment’s origin) is paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variation; no loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle; every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elements (lighthouse keeper, vintage store, broken crystal) feels organic and inevitable; lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure commits fully to its premise.</comment>
