<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Warden's interiority is concrete and motivation clear, rooted in nineteen autumns of experience. Final choice to descend and "unmake" is earned by prior causality, but lacks contradictory impulses in scene; emotional cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens held; closure is a Conceptual Repricing that redefines maintenance as unmaking through understanding. Cost is legible in the final image, and the persistent constraint of the moonlight-healed sextant shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: stormlit tower and moonlight enable the sextant's function and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through the warden's professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, escalation is a density increase as she maps dreams, leading to a deepening that reweights the stake. Protagonist agency in using the sextant drives the turn; cost is conceptual but unmistakable in the closing lines.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of sorrow quantified and made bearable through attention emerges organically from images and action. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, voice is distinctively lyrical and precise, with a perceptual signature that reflects the warden's expertise and contemplation. No head-hopping; rhythm and diction control heighten pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and free of loops or scaffolding. Sentences vary rhythmically, information density is high, and figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of labyrinth, quantified sorrow, and mundane miracles feels inevitable. Specificity of the maintenance worker’s perspective and the broken sextant transforms tropes; risk-taking in quiet structure pays off.</comment>
