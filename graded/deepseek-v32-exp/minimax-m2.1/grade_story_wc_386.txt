<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation and interiority are clear and embodied, but lacks contradictory impulses or a visible cost in her final decision; closure choice is consistent but not deeply earned by on-page struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Charged Poise with conceptual cost (giving voice to the lost), though the felt cost is somewhat oblique. Orientation is clear and structure coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory-rich setting integral to tone and theme; the glacier shrine and snow globe charge the final image, but the environment doesn't actively constrain choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation occurs via discovery (snow globe photo), but no on-page trade-off or visible price paid by protagonist; pressure accumulates without a decisive tightening under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory and reclamation emerges organically through motifs and images; final resonance is earned and avoids moralizing, though complexity is more lyrical than conflicted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with a distinct, lyrical voice; perceptual signature is strong and consistent, though no dialogue to test character distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dense, poetic prose with high information density and varied rhythm; no significant loops or artifacts, though figurative language occasionally borders on overwrought without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-cameo investigation, glacier shrine, and wreck-diving; specific, grounded details create a memorable perspective without gimmickry.</comment>
