<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied ("her own clock had stopped"), with contradictory impulses ("uncertainly certain") shown through her meticulous planning versus acceptance of intervention. Motivation drives the search, and micro-choices (descending) reveal persistence, but closure choice is not fully earned on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds (letter → greenhouse → stairwell), orientation is clear early, and closure is a Charged Poise with anticipation. However, the cost of her descent is implied rather than legible in the final image, slightly weakening the closure effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory (shattered glass, rusted frame, sound of water), filtered through Maren's POV and guiding her choices. The greenhouse and stairwell constrain her path, charging the final descent, but the subterranean waterfall remains unreached, limiting full constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding compass/brother) is signaled early, escalation follows causal linkages, and agency is present in her descent. However, pressure lacks a meaningful tightening or clear cost on-page, with no reversal or choice under duress.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of uncertainty versus control emerges through images (broken clocks, compass rose) and Maren's arc. The ending offers a non-literal answer in her descent into the unknown, resisting moralizing, but depth is slightly limited by the open closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is literary and descriptive, filtered through Maren's bias. No dialogue, but prose texture supports pressure without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished with varied syntax, strong imagery ("rusted to the color of dried blood"), and high information density. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; rhythm supports momentum, though some descriptions lean ornate without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Concept of a broken-clock tinkerer searching for a lost compass rose feels fresh through specific details and emotional truth. Tropes are transformed via character grounding, but the quest narrative is familiar, limiting higher originality.</comment>
