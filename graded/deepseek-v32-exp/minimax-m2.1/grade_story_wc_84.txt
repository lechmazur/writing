<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong characterization with embodied emotion and clear motivation; interiority is concrete, though internal contradiction is subtle and the epiphany edges toward direct statement without undermining earned causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant Conceptual Repricing; the accumulative/textural lens holds, cost is legible in the final image, and the plot’s causal chain remains tight and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, specific setting that constrains choice and charges the ending; the observatory and chip function as indispensable micro-settings, with sensory detail filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mira’s agency under the accumulative lens, culminating in a realization that reweights belonging; cost is conceptual but unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through image and action, but the final paragraph’s explicit articulation of the thesis (“the frequency of belonging was not something…”) slightly diminishes subtext, incurring a minor penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical third-person limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm and diction support the accumulative revelation without head‑hopping or distance shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Polished, dense prose with varied syntax and no artifacts; figurative language is precise and purposeful, and sentence‑level propulsion matches the story’s rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of speculative and literary quest tropes; the non‑obvious integration of stellar cipher and belonging feels inevitable, with risk‑taking in the abstract ending paying off.</comment>
