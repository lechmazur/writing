<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Melencolia's interiority is concretely embodied through tactile interactions with the atlas page and recordings; her contradictory impulses between duty and grief are in-scene, and the final choice to name monsters is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the hollow chest filling. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens held throughout; closure is a charged poise where Melencolia reconfigures grief through naming, with cost legible in "something that was not quite a heart but was enough." Orientation anchored early; persistent constraints (atlas page, recordings) shape tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Observatory at dusk is vividly filtered through POV, with sensory detail like "amber light" and "shattered dome"; the setting and atlas page constrain choice and charge the final image as monsters are named. Micro-setting functions as a tool that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal grief vs. duty; escalation under accumulative lens through density increase in reflection and imagery. Protagonist agency drives deepening as she names fears, foreclosing unprocessed sorrow with cost felt in the chest's hollow space.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of grief mapping emerges from particulars—atlas page, recordings, naming act—without moralizing; ending offers a resonant non-literal answer through the image of named monsters and carried tools. Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct lyrical-perceptual signature; voice modulates with emotional intensity, and elision (e.g., memory fragments) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; dialogue from recording feels natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "like a stone dropped into deep water." No artifacts obscure causality or closure; sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reaper mythology with intimate grief mapping; tropes transformed through specific choices (sea monsters as fears, crystallized love). Risk-taking in lyric accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
