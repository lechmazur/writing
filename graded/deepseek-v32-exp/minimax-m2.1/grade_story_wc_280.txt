<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and her motivation compels the key turn; Mira's despair is embodied but her characterization is slightly brief, though the final choice is earned with visible cost (weight of coin lifting).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with felt cost (Elara's release, Mira's choice); causal lens holds; orientation is clear early with who, where, when anchored by ~120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (emporium, orchard) constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's synesthetic perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (despair vs. possibility) tightens through Elara's agency and Mira's choice; escalation is driven by protagonist actions under the causal lens with legible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from events and images without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the coin's transformation and the "quiet miracle."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with lyrical, synesthetic perception; no head-hopping; diction and rhythm control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts; figurative language is consistent and serves closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost, synesthesia, and fractured timelines; tropes transformed through specific details; risk-taking in style enhances stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
