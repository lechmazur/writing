<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear and embodied, but internal contradiction and micro-choices under pressure are limited; the prophet serves more as a vehicle for theme than a deeply conflicted character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in "her gift and her burden"; orientation anchored early, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choice (driftwood platform as instrument) and charging the final image; sensory detail vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, escalation via density of sound and imagery driven by protagonist's strikes; cost of burden is unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transforming obstacles into music emerges through concrete action; final image offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature; lyrical voice consistent and reflective of the prophet's consciousness; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold; figurative language is clear and purposeful, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific; risk-taking in accumulative, lyrical structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
