<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction and embodied emotion are concrete under pressure (burning lungs, gasping water). The final choice to become the vessel is earned by prior causality—the vial's memories and her dwindling oxygen—with visible cost: surrendering her singular existence. No diagnostic label-speak; micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she opens the vial, the temple activates and she becomes the vessel. Closure is a decisive change on-page with felt cost ("solitary in her sacrifice"). Orientation is clear within 120 words; the persistent constraint of failing oxygen shapes tactics. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The underwater temple is vividly filtered through Marina's urgency, constraining choices (oxygen, darkness) and charging the final image. The vial as micro-setting evolves with use. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, supporting pressure and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survival vs. completing the task) escalates through her agency under the causal lens: opening the vial despite failing oxygen. Cost is legible in the final sacrifice. One meaningful tightening (decision to open) forecloses the option of return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of preserving the ephemeral emerges through particulars (vial, memories, temple) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: she becomes "the gathered hush given form." Subtext operates in image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited with a distinct lyrical voice that modulates with pressure. Perceptual signature is strong; no head-hopping. Purposeful elision (grandmother's warning) is paid off. Diction remains within the character's plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and enhances clarity. Information density is high; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. No artifacts that obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of underwater temple, perfume vial, and memory preservation feels inevitable. The transformation of the protagonist into a vessel is a fresh take on the chosen one trope. Risk-taking in lyrical tone heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
