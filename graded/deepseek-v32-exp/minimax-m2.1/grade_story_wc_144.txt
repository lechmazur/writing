<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias is a vivid, motivated artisan whose care and skill are concrete, but the absence of internal contradiction or struggle limits depth; his calm competence is consistent yet reduces complexity under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is clear and closure lands with a decisive change (drone repaired and dispatched) and resonant reconfiguration (connection enabled); the constraint of blindness and water-refraction method shapes tactics, though the cost is more implied than sharply felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mist-coated depot and water features are indispensable, constraining Elias's method and charging the final image; sensory detail is selective, vivid, and fully integrated with POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repair before departure) escalates via time pressure; Elias's agency drives the resolution, and the cost of failure is legible though success is achieved without visible sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of different sight and human connection emerge organically from repair acts and imagery; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and perceptually distinctive, with lyrical prose filtered through Elias's senses; voice remains coherent and textured under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished, dense, and rhythmically varied; sentences advance story and atmosphere with no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of blindness, artisan repair, and drone courier feels fresh and inevitable; specific details and perspective create a memorable, authentic world.</comment>
