<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira's scheming pacifism and Kael's calcified resentment are embodied through concrete micro-choices under pressure; contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene (curiosity overriding bitterness), and Kael's final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost (pin reappears, music plays). No diagnostic label-speak in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change with felt cost (grace distributed equally, pin gleams, music box plays) under a consistent Causal lens; orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of shifting grace shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting (soundless sanctuary, shifting boundaries) constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("walls breathed with borrowed time"), and the environment evolves causally with the emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving reality by releasing resentment) escalates through Mira's agency under the Causal lens; one meaningful tightening (Kael's decision to remember joy) forecloses a live option with cost legible on the page (shifting stops, garden solidifies).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (resentment as a cage, grace as redistribution) emerges through concrete particulars (music box, cellular memory, shifting sanctuary); the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material via the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is consistently poetic and character-filtered ("grace shifted around them like sand through fingers"); dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and coherent, and sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs without obscuring clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of shifting reality, cellular memory, and emotional resolution feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in concept and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the integration is fully committed to the premise.</comment>
