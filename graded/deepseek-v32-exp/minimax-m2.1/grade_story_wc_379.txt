<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's curiosity is embodied through specific micro-choices (soft footsteps, deliberate observation), and her final realization about curation is earned by the causality of discovering the letters. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with no diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (mailbox unlocked, reconciliation achieved) with felt cost (weeping, thanks). Causal lens holds tightly: curiosity → investigation → revelation → healing. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The courtyard and mailbox function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details (worn stone tiles, glinting lock) are selective, purposeful, and filtered through Elena's professional gaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering hidden stories) escalates through Elena's agency—crossing to the mailbox, listening to Mrs. Okonkwo, facilitating the reading. Cost is legible in the estranged sister's tears and the reconfigured purpose of the thrift shop.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (listening as generative, healing through witness) emerges organically from particulars like the scratched lock and unsent letters. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (curator's eye for stories). Prose rhythm modulates with the quiet intensity of the courtyard, and dialogue (Mrs. Okonkwo's low tones) carries subtext naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: high information density, varied sentence rhythm, no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("sandstorm calm") is pattern-taught and pays off at closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The locked mailbox mystery is a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative plot heightens stakes through specificity and emotional truth.</comment>
