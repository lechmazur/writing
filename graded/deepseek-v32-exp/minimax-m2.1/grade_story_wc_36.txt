<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kira's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictions between guilt and determination driving micro-choices. Her final realization—that guardianship means witnessing—is earned by prior causality, with the cost of Oresta's ruins felt throughout. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; her emotional progression is realistic and flawed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with visible cost: Kira accepts her role as witness, foreclosing active intervention. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with reflection tightening into insight. Orientation is clear early; structure is a single continuous scene fitting the length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting pressures choice through canyon hush and echoes, forcing solitude that charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and vivid, filtered through Kira's POV. The flute and driftwood function as micro-settings that constrain action and accumulate meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal redemption) escalates under the Accumulative lens via density of reflection, reweighted by Kira's agency. Cost is legible in her acceptance of witnessing versus acting. One meaningful tightening—the insight at Listener's Crossing—forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (witnessing vs. intervention) emerges organically from concrete images and actions, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Kira's realization, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and object handling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, reflective, and consistent. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and prose rhythm supports pressure. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("avalanchingly quiet") is coherent and heightens atmosphere. Sentences advance story and character; no overwriting or clarity issues in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing relic-keeper tropes into a meditation on failure and witnessing, with specific details like Thunder-echo range and driftwood markers. The quiet, reflective risk pays off in closure, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
