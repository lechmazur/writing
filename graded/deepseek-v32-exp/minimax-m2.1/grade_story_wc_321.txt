<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren's ardence and resilient positivity are consistent and motivate her climactic choice, but interior contradiction is minimal; her final decision feels earned by prior causality, though the cost of danger remains somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clear causal chain from urgent transmission to decisive action; closure is a Decisive Change (she becomes the nexus) with legible cost (risk of scattering); orientation is immediate and the inferred causal lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The spectral grotto and sideways starlight are vividly specific and integral to the premise; the setting constrains the action (intersection point) and charges the final image of solidifying waters.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preventing passenger dissolution) tightens via the urgent radio call; Maren's agency drives the escalation to become the nexus, with cost (scattering risk) clearly on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of finding home in transience emerges organically from images (empty hourglass, permanent transient) and the final resonant reconfiguration without moralizing; the ending offers a non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is consistent and selective; experimental elements (sideways time) are taught and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with purposeful figurative language; no loops or scaffolds that obscure causality; minor overwriting in early description does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of commuter ferry and timeline fracture, executed with specific, grounded detail; risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
