<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to negotiate with her ghost is clear and intensifies; interiority is concrete and embodied (e.g., "the camera wheel grew heavier"). The ghost's silent presence creates a crucible. The final endurance (exhaustion as peace) is earned by the accumulated fragments and confrontation. Minor: ghost is passive, but this serves the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; orientation is clear within 120 words (kinetic lagoon, carousel halted). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with on-page cost in the final lines: "exhaustion, too, is a kind of peace." The persistent constraint of the lagoon and camera wheel shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon is a micro-setting that constrains choice (Mira moves through it, collects voices) and charges the final image of fractured stillness. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Mira's perception (e.g., "water moved fastest despite no current"). Vivid and integral to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (negotiating with her ghost) escalates through accumulative density: gathering fragments, the ghost's appearance, and Mira's speech. Cost is legible in the exhaustion of the final negotiation. Agency is in her method of collection and confrontation, tightening under the textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of eroded ambitions and self-reckoning emerges through concrete fragments and the camera wheel's function. Subtext operates in silence and image. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("exhaustion... is a kind of peace") without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct; voice is lyrical and consistent, with perceptual signature (e.g., "ribbons of melody that unraveled upward"). No head-hopping. Purposeful compression (fragments) is taught and pays off at closure. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and polished, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and heightens atmosphere (e.g., "smoke pretending to be something finer"). Information density is high; every sentence advances story or character. No artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of a kinetic lagoon, a camera wheel that collects stories, and a ghost negotiation. The accumulative structure is bold and fully committed, heightening stakes without gimmickry. The premise feels organic and inevitable in hindsight, with specific, irreplaceable details.</comment>
