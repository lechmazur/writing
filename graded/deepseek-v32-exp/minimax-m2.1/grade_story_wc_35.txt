<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Miriam's motivation is clear and rooted in her established gift/curse, and her final endurance (Earned Stasis) is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("sturdy brittle quality"). Interiority is concrete and character-particular. A slight deduction for a lack of vividly contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; her decision path is somewhat linear though credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly. Orientation is immediate. Closure lands on-page as an Earned Stasis with felt cost ("stronger and more fragile"). The transition from understanding to the three-day work is slightly summarized but does not break causality or obscure cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The coral pavilion and desert setting are vividly specific, sensorily rich, and crucially constrain choice (the formations dictate her work) and charge the final image. Micro-setting (the pools, the coral) is fully integrated into the action and theme, passing the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (alleviating the pavilion's burden) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: her first touch reveals the scale of the problem, compelling her to apply her unique skill. Cost is legible in her transformed state at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (transforming pain into purpose, sorrow as a kind of endurance) emerges organically from events and imagery, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image of Miriam walking away, carrying the knowledge that "some memories would always taste like sorrow."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt. The voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that remains controlled under pressure. Perception is filtered through Miriam's professional bias (reading flavors, analyzing formations). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense, purposeful, and rhythmically varied with high information density. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Some phrases are ornate ("palimpsest of remembered moments") but are voice-motivated and consistent, not obscuring clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and synthesized with specificity—the memory-tasting chef and the remorse-storing pavilion feel organic and inevitable. The lyric risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative echoes or middle-ground hedging.</comment>
