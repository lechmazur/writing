<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Calyx's motivation is clear and deeply rooted, with embodied interiority showing her obsession and transformation. Her final choice is earned by prior causality, though the emotional cost could be more visceral in the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early, and closure lands with Conceptual Repricing as she gains new understanding. The gravity inversion provides a persistent constraint, but the hybrid lens slightly softens causal tightness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated, with the grotto and inversion actively shaping choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early, and escalation is driven by Calyx's agency as she navigates and deciphers markings. Cost is legible in her transformation, though time pressure could be more urgent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge and perception emerges organically, with a resonant, non-literal answer in closure. Subtext is rich in images like "prism" and "seeds," avoiding moralizing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise of gravity inversion and forgotten combinations is fresh and well-executed, with specific details transforming tropes. Risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
