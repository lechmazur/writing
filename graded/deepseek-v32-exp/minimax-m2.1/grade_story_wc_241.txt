<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses—gift for numbers and curse for risk—are embodied in micro-choices like photographing subway scrawls; final understanding with her father is earned, with cost visible in the lantern's flicker.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration via the lantern's honest light, with cost legible in "addition of losses... multiplication of meaning." Orientation anchors early in the library scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory details like "wet stone and old paper" are selective; the lantern as micro-setting constrains choice and charges the final image, integrating setting with character perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding father) escalates through Elara's agency in interpreting scrawls and visiting hospital; cost is felt in the emotional weight of their shared realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of probability and honesty emerges through particulars; ending offers non-literal answer via the lantern's light, avoiding moralizing while reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct academic voice; syntax reflects Elara's reflective state, e.g., "clover melancholy"; no head-hopping; dialogue is natural and sparse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density, varied rhythm, and no loops or artifacts; figurative language like "amber quiet" is consistent and purposeful, supporting closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of probability and grief through specific details like subway scrawls; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
