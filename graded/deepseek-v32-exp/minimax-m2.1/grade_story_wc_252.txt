<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maren's interior contradiction and embodied emotion are concrete; her final choice to step into the water is earned by prior causality with visible cost in leaving the scrimshaw, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively as Maren enters the water, a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative lens; cost is legible in the abandoned talisman and opened heart, with lens held consistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe and scrimshaw are micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of internal freedom escalates through the whale's call and Maren's agency; cost is felt in her surrender of the scrimshaw and embrace of the unknown, driven under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of freedom through surrender emerges from particulars like the scrimshaw and whale's call; the ending offers a non-literal answer without moralizing, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice has a distinct perceptual signature with lyrical rhythm; POV is stable and filters perception through Maren's bias, with no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or figurative muddle, even in peak beats, and clarity supports closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-conflict setting, whale symbolism, and personal liberation feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
