<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elena's contradictory impulses (analytical mind vs. her father's deception) are concretely embodied; her final choice to help Darius is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her reconfigured understanding. Slight deduction for the epiphany being somewhat summarized rather than fully dramatized in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost felt in Elena's peace; causal lens holds tight; orientation is immediate and anchors who, where, when. The three-week ellipsis is efficient and does not break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The funeral prep room and ink pot function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., "humming lights," "tarnished brass"); atmosphere of "deathly vitality" is sustained throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding a fair trade to help Darius) tightens via Elena's active decision to write the application; escalation is driven by her agency under the causal lens; cost is legible in her transformed understanding and the risk undertaken.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of honesty vs. deception emerges from particulars (ink pot, father's legacy, asylum case); ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Elena's found "equation"; subtext operates in gesture and image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Elena's analytical perception; voice is distinct, precise, and modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but functional and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is clean, dense, and propulsive; zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is controlled and purposeful; rhythm varies naturally; sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere without artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar elements (con artist's child, magical ink, asylum seeker) feels fresh and inevitable; the funeral home setting and ink's truth-revealing property invert expectations; emotional specificity avoids cliché.</comment>
