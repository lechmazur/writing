<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses—hoarding light yet giving everything away—are embodied in specific micro-choices (the detour, releasing the jars). The final renunciation is earned by her journey, with cost felt in her destitution. Slight deduction for the epiphany's overt statement ("transformation is not a destination..."), which edges toward diagnostic label-speak in the peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure is a Charged Poise reconfiguring Mara's stance with undeniable cost ("destitute and luminous"). Orientation is immediate, and the eclipse's apex provides a decisive cadence shift. The prophecy motif pays off without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and charges the final image—the black sand remembers, the volcano rumbles in recognition. Sensory details (sand humming, tide's hesitation) are filtered through Mara's perception and amplify the atmosphere. The volcano and beach are indispensable to the closure effect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation builds through density of imagery and the approaching eclipse, culminating in Mara's agentive release of the jars. The cost—her destitution exchanged for luminous understanding—is legible on the page. A single meaningful tightening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete images (lightning bugs, eclipse, jars) and Mara's journey. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer, though the spelled-out message ("transformation is not a destination...") slightly over-articulates the thesis, risking thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that remains consistent under pressure. The prose rhythm modulates with the scene's quiet intensity. No head-hopping; all elision (prophecies, backstory) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical, with high information density and varied sentence rhythms. No scaffold or loop artifacts; figurative language is coherent and purposeful. The final paragraph's "destitute and luminous" crystallizes the image without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of destitute philanthropist, bottled lightning bugs, and celestial convergence feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative plot heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded particulars.</comment>
