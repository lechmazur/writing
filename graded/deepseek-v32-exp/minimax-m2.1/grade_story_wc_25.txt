<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s expertise and motivation are clear, rooted in backstory and embodied emotion, but internal contradiction is minimal; final choice earns credibility through prior causality, though flaw complexity is light for this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in Reyes’ admission; causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate; storm constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the container labyrinth and storm actively constrain every choice; sensory detail is selective and charged, culminating in the final violet-light image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (whispers vs. official channels) escalate through Mira’s agency; one meaningful tightening—the challenge and her response—drives to a legible cost in the hierarchy shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (old knowledge vs. technology) emerges through concrete particulars; ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single PVO stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical yet precise, reflecting Mira’s expertise; no head‑hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with zero loops or artifacts; figurative language (“steel groaned in fog”) serves pressure and closure; sentence‑level propulsion is flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of maze‑and‑storm tropes through specific character knowledge; risk‑taking in quiet, conceptual payoff heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
