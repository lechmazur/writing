<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her attentiveness to slow transformation. Interiority is concrete, as seen in her understanding of the bread as "tenuous absolution." The final acceptance of continued restoration is earned with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the butterfly emergence and internal lift. Cost is legible in her acknowledgment of absolution, and persistent constraint of decay shapes tactics. Orientation is clear early, no penalties.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting vividly constrains choice: the tea house requires uncloaking, and the courtyard's decay influences actions. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, charging the final image with bread and butterfly. Meets 9+ test as environment shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding sacred in ordinary persistence escalates through accumulative density. Protagonist agency in acceptance and continuation; cost is felt in her trust that "even the most tenuous absolution was worth the tending." Under the lens, escalation is sufficient with legible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images like bread and butterfly; subtext operates through implication. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material. Quick test satisfied with earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and attentive, reflecting Elara's mindset. No dialogue, but prose rhythm and diction control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity. Quick test met with distinct signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; figurative language is consistent and purposeful. Read-aloud ear test passes, and closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of themes like absolution and persistence; specific details like guerrilla gardening and uncloaking create originality. Risk-taking in quiet, reflective style pays off with coherence. Non-obvious synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
