<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses as a scientist and secret believer are dramatized in scene, and her final acceptance is earned by the shell’s revelations, with the cost of her shattered skepticism legible in the quiet, embodied shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly; orientation is immediate; closure is a decisive change (skepticism shattered, resolve to find the other half) with felt cost on the page (“her skeptic’s heart finally opened”).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory-rich setting that supports tone and theme, but while the garden charges the final image, it does not constrain choice; the shell is the primary constraint, capping at 8.8 per the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (belief vs. skepticism) escalates through Mira’s active listening and the shell’s revelations; cost is unmistakable as her worldview breaks and a new purpose is taken up.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory, legacy, and transforming loss emerges through concrete particulars; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with a distinct perceptual signature blending scientific lexicon and lyrical observation; voice remains coherent and controlled under pressure, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of loops or scaffold; figurative language is precise and purposeful; information density is high without obscuring causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of scientific and mystical concepts feels inevitable; specific details (half-shell, resonance structures) and emotional truth elevate the premise beyond template.</comment>
