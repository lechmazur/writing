<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied; her "gift" with plants is shown through tactile work, and trauma manifests somatically rather than through diagnostic labels. The final realization—optimism growing from "realistic soil"—is earned by three years of nursing plants and enduring grief. Micro-choices (handling the photograph, transplanting seedlings) reveal a hierarchy of values. No contradictions or unmotivated leaps.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through reflective shards that deepen the stake of surviving grief. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she cups the cereus flower and understands her project. Cost is legible in the line "optimism could grow not from denial but from the realistic soil of what could actually, measurably, wither and survive." Orientation is clear within ~120 words (lighthouse property, greenhouse, photograph).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the salt-crusted greenhouse on a wind-scoured cliff pressures her isolation and becomes the "cathedral" where she rebuilds. Environment constrains choice—the managed wilderness mirrors her internal struggle. Sensory details (soil under fingernails, temperature of air) are filtered through her POV and are purposefully selective. The cliff's edge charges the final image of anchored space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal: enduring grief vs. building a meaningful present) is signaled early. Escalation under the Accumulative lens occurs through somatic markers and crystallizes in the cereus flower beat, a decisive deepening that reweights her understanding of survival. Cost is visible: she accepts that healing is not a destination but a "small anchored space." Agency is in her daily endurance and final realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the photograph, the greenhouse work, the cereus flower. Subtext operates in the wrinkled photograph ("as if the wrinkles held something true") and the contrast between the lighthouse warning ships and her own crash. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—optimism rooted in what can "wither and survive"—without moralizing. No thematic echo or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with a distinct lyrical texture that matches her contemplative state. Perceptual signature is strong (noticing plant pulses, somatic markers). No head-hopping. Syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional pressure (e.g., short sentences during "freeze" beats). Elision (the wedding catastrophe) is taught early and pays off in the photograph's charged presence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("cathedral of glass," "pearl of stillness") is consistent and purposeful. Sentence variety supports emotional cadence, from long, accumulative descriptions to sharp, somatic fragments ("The freeze was not a failure."). No register drift or mixed metaphors in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma recovery with botanical healing, avoiding cliché. The drone strike wedding backstory is transformed through specific, grounded detail (the fire-damaged photograph, the "sound that was louder than sound"). The "pearl of stillness" concept feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
