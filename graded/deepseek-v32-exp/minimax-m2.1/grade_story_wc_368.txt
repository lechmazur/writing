<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Yuen's watchful patience and embodied realization are compelling, with a meaningful change earned through specific details, but the epiphany lacks contradictory impulses in scene, preventing the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative structure builds to a clear conceptual repricing with legible cost in his renewed purpose; orientation is early and lens holds, though cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive setting and the butterfly wing charge the final image, but the environment does not actively constrain choices, limiting its impact on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stake escalates through Yuen's focused attention in accumulative deepening, with agency in reflection and legible cost in his heart beating with purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of transformative attention is woven through concrete images and earned realization, but near-explicit statement in the epiphany slightly reduces subtextual resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical, consistent POV with a distinct perceptual signature tied to Yuen's profession; rhythmic control is strong, though slightly ornate, and capped due to Q2 not reaching 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elegant, dense prose with purposeful imagery and no artifacts; figurative language is coherent, but a few phrases edge toward poetic abstraction, and capped due to Q2 not reaching 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Unique synthesis of heart transplant, dye mastery, and butterfly wing creates a fresh, inevitable perspective on storytelling, with risk-taking in lyrical approach that heightens stakes.</comment>
