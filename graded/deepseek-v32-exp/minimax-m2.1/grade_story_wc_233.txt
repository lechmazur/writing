<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular (weariness, weight of crown). The final choice/renunciation (to embrace a renewed purpose) is earned by the climb and the grotto's revelation, with the cost being the shedding of her disenchanted identity. A slight weakness: the shift from weariness to reborn wonder at the climax feels slightly rapid, though anchored in the prior dreams and the firefly exhale moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid) with felt cost: she will not return as the weary ruler. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through atmospheric density and image patterns to the final understanding. Orientation is swift and clear. The closure cost is legible in the final image of her smile after three years.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposeful, fully filtered through the queen's perception. The cobalt/ember grotto is not just described but actively constrains her choice (she must kneel and witness) and decisively charges the final image and revelation. The environment's "bleeding starlight" is integral to the plot's climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as a density increase and cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake (solving the mystery/reclaiming purpose). Pressure coheres from the etched warning through the arduous climb to the grotto's revelation. The protagonist's agency (the decision to climb and then to kneel and interpret) drives the escalation. The cost—the relinquishment of her disenchanted self—is legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme (disenchantment vs. wonder, duty rediscovered through connection) emerges organically from images and action, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the fireflies as "promises kept." The bleeding starlight motif shifts from menace to invitation, deepening the thematic resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable, third-person limited with a lyrical, slightly archaic register suited to the character. The perceptual signature is distinct (noticing "frost and distant storms," "copper and wonder"). The voice modulates under pressure ("lacy menace") but maintains coherence. No head-hopping or distance issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and often beautiful, but shows minor artifacts: some overwriting ("lacy menace of the place settled around her shoulders like a cape made of spiderwebs and threat" mixes metaphors) and a tendency toward stacked figurative language in peak beats. However, rhythm is controlled, and clarity at closure is unharmed. Information density is high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The core premise (a queen's mystical pilgrimage) is familiar but transformed through specific, grounded imagery (bleeding starlight, firefly-mist constellations) and a textured, accumulative approach. The synthesis of internal disillusionment and external, wounded magic feels organic and fresh in execution, avoiding cliché. The risk-taking in the lyrical prose largely succeeds.</comment>
