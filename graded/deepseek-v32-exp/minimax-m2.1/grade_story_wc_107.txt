<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied; contradictory impulses (weighty lightness) act in scene; final shaping of vessel earned by prior causality with visible cost of internal thawing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (internal thawing) with felt cost on-page; orientation clear early; persistent constraint of thawing heart shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (abandoned control room, melting ice) charges final image and constrains choice by providing sanctuary; sensory detail selective and POV-filtered; micro-setting (tools, bookmark) integrates with closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal thawing/safe inquiry) signaled early; escalation driven by protagonist's agency in shaping glass; cost legible in "un Freezing of something essential"; one meaningful tightening under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (transformation, scars, safe inquiry) emerges from particulars like bookmark and glass; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via vessel as safe space; no moralizing, subtext in objects.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature (lyrical, reflective glassblower); voice modulates with emotional intensity; rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; zero loops or scaffold; figurative language purposeful and consistent; clarity maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of glassblowing, thawing, and abandoned setting feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet introspection heightens stakes; specific details (cracked bookmark) anchor authenticity.</comment>
