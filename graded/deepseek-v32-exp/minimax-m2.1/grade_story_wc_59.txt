<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prince's interiority is concrete and his final choice to pursue integration over destruction is earned by prior hypothesizing and discovery; embodied emotion is present but occasionally abstract. The cost of his renunciation is more conceptual than visceral, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing: the prince reinterprets the Genesis Engine and egg's purpose, leading to a new goal of integration. Causal lens holds, orientation is immediate, and the cost of lost beauty and uncertain reconciliation is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the Oology Chamber and the fossilized egg are central, charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven through action and reflection, meeting the 9+ test of environmental pressure on closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fate of mechanical vs. organic life) escalates through the prince's agency in discovering and decoding the egg. One meaningful tightening occurs when the golden veins reveal instructions, forcing a trade-off between destruction and integration with felt conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of integrating mechanical and organic beauty emerges through concrete images and the prince's realization, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—reconciliation of sorrow and hope—without moralizing, and subtext is rich in the egg's symbolism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a lyrical, reflective voice fitting the prince's perspective. Perceptual signature is distinct, though elevated diction occasionally distances. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is polished with vivid figurative language and high information density. Minor overwriting in abstract phrases ("bittersweet ache of partial understanding") slightly dampens peak beats, but no loops or scaffold artifacts harm clarity or closure momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar post-apocalyptic and quest tropes through specific focus on an egg as a biological key and the choice of integration over destruction. Lyrical risk-taking coheres with emotional truth, though not entirely unprecedented.</comment>
