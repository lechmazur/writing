<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's characterization is deeply integrated with her actions: her reversible exile, nervous backward step, and "combative tenderness" are embodied in micro-choices that earn the final nod. The children's haunted defiance adds credible pressure. The only minor note is that "combative tenderness" risks label-speak but is immediately dramatized by her unflinching gaze and deliberate tea-pouring.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure is a Charged Poise—the boy reaching for his cup as a "fragile bud of resilience"—with cost legible in the children's terror and Maren's exile. Orientation is anchored early ("forgotten library," afternoon light). No causality breaks; the single-scene structure tightens around the mentorship stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image: the shadow caught in glass recurs as a teachable object for reversible exile; the library's hush and swinging creak frame the emotional stakes. Sensory detail ("dust motes turn like slow planets") is selective, POV-filtered, and woven into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is driven by Maren's agency—her deliberate tea ceremony and exile speech deepen the stakes from terror to curiosity. The dominant stake (mentoring resilience) tightens in the suspended moment where "everything could tip toward healing," with cost felt in the children's frozen soil of trauma.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of reversible exile emerges through concrete particulars: the shadow in glass, walking backward, tea-leaf geometry. Subtext operates in gestures (Maren's nod, the boy's reach). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the "fragile bud of resilience" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct; voice is lyrical yet precise ("dust motes turn like slow planets"), with a perceptual signature that filters through Maren's archivist sensibility. No dialogue, but compression and patterned elision (e.g., the swing motif) are taught early and pay off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits flawless rhythmic control and high information density; sentences advance character, atmosphere, and theme without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("slow planets," "frozen soil") is consistent and clear, even in peak beats. Read-aloud ear test passes with varied syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of archivist, exile, and mentor tropes through specific, grounded choices: "combative tenderness," walking backwards, tea-leaf geometry as spatial poetry. Emotional truth avoids generic templates; the quiet, accumulative structure takes risks that heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
