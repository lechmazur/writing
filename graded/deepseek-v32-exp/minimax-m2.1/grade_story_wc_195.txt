<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Aldric's motivation and internal arc are clear and earned, with concrete micro-choices under pressure, though contradictory impulses are not heavily dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under a consistent accumulative lens; the greenhouse's magic constrains tactics and the cost (its fading) is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details; the alchemical orchard and marionettes actively constrain Aldric's choices and decisively charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are internal but clear; escalation through Aldric's agency (reading, oath, manipulation) leads to a legible cost under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of possibility emerges organically from particulars; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is controlled and rhythm supports pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dense, lyrical prose with high information density and rhythmic variety; no loops or artifacts that obscure clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of knight, alchemy, and marionettes into a singular meditation on possibility; feels inevitable in hindsight with risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
