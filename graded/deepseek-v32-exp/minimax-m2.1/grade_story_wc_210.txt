<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion in micro-choices, but interior contradiction is summarized rather than dramatized in scene, slightly limiting depth. Final renunciation of magic is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—the hard work of remembrance—landing on-page; causal lens holds tight; orientation is clear within 120 words; persistent constraint of memory over magic shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and selective, with the cove and amber bottle constraining choice and charging the final revival; micro-setting functions as essential pressure point, integrated into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of revival escalates through Elias's agency; one meaningful tightening occurs as memory replaces magic, with cost legible in the ending's rejection of wish-based solutions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from memory vs. magic, with subtext in imagery; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer, though the line "harder work of remembrance" leans slightly explicit without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct lyrical-perceptual signature; voice modulates with pressure, and purposeful elision (memory-work) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or artifacts; figurative language is controlled, and sentence-level propulsion accelerates toward closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of alchemy and memory transforms wish tropes; specific details feel inevitable, and risk-taking in lyrical approach heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
