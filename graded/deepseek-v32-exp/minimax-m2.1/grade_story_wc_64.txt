<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character is consistent and interiority is present, but lacks internal contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure; final realization is earned but without visible cost or struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure lands with a conceptual repricing of the gardener's role, though cost is subtle; orientation is clear early, structure is coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory setting establishes atmosphere, but the cobalt silo does not constrain choice or directly charge the final image; strong selectivity and POV filter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are low but clear; escalation is a quiet deepening of understanding driven by protagonist agency, but no foreclosed options or unmistakable cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of listening across time emerges organically; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext is woven through image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and perceptually distinct; voice is lyrical and controlled; no dialogue, but elision and compression serve the accumulative pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with varied rhythm and high information density; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of contemplative discovery and historical resonance; specific details (cobalt silo, tapestry) create inevitability; quiet risk supports coherence.</comment>
