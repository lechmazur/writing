<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and embodied through artist-specific details; her motivation intensifies under pressure, and her final redesign is earned by prior causality with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions act in scene (e.g., questioning her identity while untangling threads).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (redesigning herself) with on-page cost in the final image of the completed box. Orientation anchored early; no causality breaks; persistent constraint of fragmented reality shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (lighthouse library, tarot cards) constrains choices and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and filtered through Mira's POV. Micro-setting (cards and threads) actively pressures her descent and realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, escalation is driven by density increase as Mira untangles threads; stakes (self-perception) tighten meaningfully, and cost is legible in her redesign. Agency is consistent, with no coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (fragmentation as gift) emerges through particulars (cards, threads) without moralizing; subtext operates in imagery; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (artist's eye for patterns); voice is lyrical yet controlled, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., time fraying) is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is pattern-taught and supports clarity. No artifacts obscure cause/effect or closure; sentences advance story and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of self-discovery through tarot and perception; tropes transformed via specific details (paint-stained fingers, shifting cards). Risk-taking in lyric accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure feels inevitable.</comment>
