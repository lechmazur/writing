<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dr. Vance's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with her emotional rationality both enabling and constraining her confrontation. The final choice to publish is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate; the accumulative lens holds as reflection deepens stakes. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (her decision to publish) and legible cost, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The station is vividly filtered through the historian's perception and charges the final image as a point of historical convergence, meeting the 9+ test by constraining choice symbolically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (truth vs. communal myth) escalates through her reflective analysis, culminating in a decisive agency to publish with unmistakable cost, driven under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars, though the final paragraph's explicit statement ("the only way to honor the past...") slightly moralizes, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct—scholarly, precise, and reflective of the historian's mind. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is strong and consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with varied syntax and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful, maintaining momentum through reflective beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of historical investigation with personal legacy feels fresh and inevitable. Specific details (illuminated letter, station) avoid cliché, and the moral calculus is non-obvious.</comment>
