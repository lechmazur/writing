<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s compassionate recluse trait is concretely embodied through specific memories and embodied emotion ("stone in her chest"). Contradictory impulses—hiding versus returning—act simultaneously in scene, and her final decision to reply is earned by reflective causality with visible cost (facing her mother's illness). No stock phrasing or diagnostic self-awareness undermines the peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise ("Tomorrow, she would write her reply") with felt cost of re-engagement. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: reflection deepens to reweight the stake. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the invitation as persistent constraint shapes tactics. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through Mira’s perception ("dust motes perform their slow ballet") and constrains choice—the library offers wisdom that catalyzes her return. The crumpled invitation charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, avoiding generic placeholder syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hiding vs. engaging) escalates via accumulative density—her realization that "leaving was the answer, when the answer had been learning to stay while leaving" reweights options. Cost is legible in the decision to reply, driven by protagonist agency under the textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of paradox and return emerges from particulars (invitation, library, errors) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of replying, reweighting prior material. No thematic echo or summary in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature ("the bell... had not rung in seventeen years, yet Mira remembered its voice like a favorite song"). Rhythm modulates with reflective pressure, and no head-hopping or register drift occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("dust motes perform their slow ballet") is consistent and clear, and peak beats avoid muddle. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of secret society library, compassionate recluse, and wisdom-from-mistakes feels organic and inevitable. Originality lies in specific, grounded choices that heighten stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming familiar themes through character particulars.</comment>
