<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply interior and embodied; motivation clear and intensifies under pressure with micro-choices revealing values. Final choice earned by prior causality, with visible cost in acceptance of endings. Contradictory impulses act in scene, and renunciation is credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds tightly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the final image. Orientation clear early, structure coherent, and constraint (parasol tip, ice) shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integral, with drift-ice marina and parasol tip constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details selective and purposeful, mirroring internal states; micro-setting functions as crucible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learning endings) escalates through agency under accumulative lens; meaningful tightening as she trawls debris and accepts release. Cost visible in her prepared departure, foreclosing other paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—endings, patience, courage—with subtext in irony and imagery. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; complexity embraced, inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct with perceptual signature reflecting transformed senses; POV stable, prose rhythm supports emotional beats. No head-hopping; elision taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose polished with high information density, varied rhythm, and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language consistent and purposeful; line-level craft supports momentum and clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality high with fresh premise (euthanasia tourist) and specific synthesis; risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Feels inevitable and authentic.</comment>
