<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation and interiority are concrete and embodied, driving the narrative with micro-choices under pressure. However, the lack of on-page contradictory impulses in scene prevents the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an accumulative/textural lens, cost legible in the final reverence. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting and object (the button) are vividly specific, charging the final image and constraining choice through historical weight and tactile detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency in examining the button, deepening stakes through accumulative density with a felt cost of honoring hidden kindnesses.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars, with subtext in the button's symbolism; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is consistently literary and rhythmic, modulating with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied syntax and no loops or artifacts; figurative language is precise and supports closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of historical archive and personal grief feels inevitable; specificity in detail and risk in quiet reflection heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
