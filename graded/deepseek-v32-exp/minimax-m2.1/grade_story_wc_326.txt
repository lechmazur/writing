<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is concrete and particular, with her heartbeat-counting trauma embodied throughout. Her final realization—forgiveness replacing anger—is earned by the ritual interaction with the ghost and carries a visible cost in the release of her counting. Interior contradiction (anger vs. sought wisdom) is shown in scene, not summarized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with a clear before/after: Mira moves from counting heartbeats in anger to trusting them, feeling "whole." The inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building pattern and density toward this reconfiguration. Cost is legible in the final paragraph's "felt whole," a decisive shift from her ghostly state. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The opal observatory is not just vivid backdrop; it constrains choice (isolation enables the ritual) and decisively charges the final image ("hummed softly, a sound like distant stars breathing"). Sensory detail (frosted window, cooling ink, falling snow) is filtered through Mira's urgent, precise perception and serves the accumulating texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mira's search for meaning/wholeness after systemic erasure—escalates through the textural deepening of her interaction with the ghost. Under the accumulative lens, pressure tightens via pattern (ink, heartbeats) until the final transmission forces a stance crystallization. The cost—relinquishing her anger—is legible on the page and forecloses that path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (forgiveness of systemic failure, the human behind the error) emerges wholly from the specific, dramatized relationship between Mira and the architect's ghost. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of snow burying "equations that no system could process" and Mira's felt wholeness, repricing the prior conflict without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable, first-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature (clinical, star-observant, trauma-precise). The voice's lyrical density is controlled and voice-motivated, modulating with emotional intensity. The elision of the ghost's direct speech into sensation is taught and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and highly controlled, with rhythmic variation and clear propulsion. Information density is high (e.g., "soft white equations that no system could process" does multiple jobs). No observable paraphrase loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level craft supports the accumulative, textural drive without obscuring causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a digital ghost, ink-based ritual, and post-systemic collapse feels fresh and organic. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting (the observatory, the heartbeat count). The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight, born from established pattern and character choice, not a late rule change.</comment>
