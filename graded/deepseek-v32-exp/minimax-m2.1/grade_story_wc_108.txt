<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maya’s phobia and stunt-double history create concrete interiority; her final choice to decrypt the notes and confront Daniel is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in trembling certainty. The adaptive trait and betrayal force a credible stance shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate; closure is a decisive change (rejection of Daniel’s control) with felt cost (“trembling certainty”). The seashell and cast provide coherent because/therefore linkages.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars is more than atmosphere: its enclosed space triggers her phobia, and starlight enables reading the cast, directly constraining choice and charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (identity vs. control) tighten via Daniel’s entrance and her decryption; escalation is driven by her agency under pressure, with cost legible in her embodied fear and transformed vulnerability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (vulnerability as strength) emerges through specific actions and images; the ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer via the seashell’s final whisper as her own voice, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third‑person limited POV is stable and voice‑driven; lyrical but controlled diction (“stars humming,” “moonlight like spilled milk”) reflects Maya’s perceptual signature under stress without head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmically varied, and free of loops or scaffold; metaphors are consistent and vivid; line‑level propulsion advances character and stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of stunt‑double phobia, whispering seashell, and encrypted cast feels fresh and inevitable; risk‑taking in lyrical compression heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
