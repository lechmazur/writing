<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final acceptance of the covenant is earned by prior causality, and the cost is legible in the "crushing weight" of the box, though her passivity limits contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear cost ("impossible lightness and its crushing weight"). Orientation is early, causality coheres through Mira's observation leading to discovery, and the persistent constraint of unspoken words shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly selective and purposeful, with sensory detail filtered through Mira's perception. The abandoned apiary and stained glass box constrain choice and charge the final image, integrating tightly with atmosphere and stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Mira's agency in digging and accepting the covenant, with unmistakable cost in the weight of the box. Dominant stake (preserving unspoken words) tightens meaningfully through the ghost's appearance and discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through imagery and subtext, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the stained glass box and Mira's role as keeper. No moralizing; complexity arises from the covenant of silence and memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature ("tranquilly perceptive") and rhythmic control. Voice reflects Mira's observational nature, and elision (e.g., ghost's backstory) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density, varied rhythm, and clear propulsion without loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("ribs of some ancient, docile creature") is purposeful and consistent, supporting peak beats without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic ghost story with beekeeping imagery and themes of silence. Fresh angle transforms tropes through specific details like the stained glass box, and risk-taking in quiet lyricism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
