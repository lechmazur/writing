<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Character is rendered with concrete interiority and a consistent, vocation-specific perceptual lens; her final stance (carried lesson) is earned by the preceding reflective beats. However, the piece lacks internal contradiction or a significant on-page choice under pressure, limiting the score under the high-band gate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens is clear and held; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the boat engine's ripple completes the pattern, with cost legible in the loss of pre-dawn stillness. Orientation is immediate, and the single shard with one transition fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through the glazier's perception and actively constrains choice—the pond and its ripples are a micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, fully integrated with the thematic arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a cadence shift (boat engine breaking stillness) that reweights the dominant stake (preserving clarity). Protagonist agency in reading the ripples and turning to work drives the deepening, with cost visible in the encroaching day.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the juxtaposition of glass, light, and water; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (the pond's lesson) that reweights the mundane without moralizing. Subtext operates through image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is a distinct, lyrical third-person closely aligned with the glazier's perceptual signature; rhythmic control and purposeful compression are maintained under pressure. POV is stable and distance is apt for the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated; closure image is clear and uncluttered by artifact. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A fresh, specific synthesis of vocation and perception feels inevitable; the quiet, contemplative risk heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is transformed through grounded, particular detail and a singular artistic stance.</comment>
