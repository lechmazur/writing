<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in contradictory impulses (amoral yet sentimental), shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices. The final release is earned by prior causality with visible cost on the page ("she had given up everything"). Minor label-speak ("amoral philanthropist") is offset by concrete interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise—the egg left alone, waiting—and cost is legible in sacrifices and uncertainty. Causal lens holds tightly from motivation to action. Orientation is immediate, and the map/drought constraints shape tactics leading to the release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Salt flat and egg are vivid, sensory, and essential: the setting eliminates threats, and the object charges the final image. Details are filtered through POV, guiding choice and mirroring internal states (emptiness vs. fragility). No generic postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving extinction's echo) escalates via her agency under causal lens, culminating in the release. Cost is unmistakable in her sacrifices and the sterile sanctuary. One meaningful tightening—the timed release—forecloses options with felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from resurrection, sacrifice, and moral ambiguity, without moralizing. Subtext in images (egg, thunder, salt) and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer. "Fractured grace" is slightly explicit but integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—blend of scientific precision and lyricism. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and elision (past reflections) is anchored in present cues. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic control, high information density, and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("like a second heartbeat") serves pressure. Sentence variety supports momentum, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise of de-extinction gains freshness through specific details (salt flat, crack-map, sentimental obsession) and moral complexity. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
