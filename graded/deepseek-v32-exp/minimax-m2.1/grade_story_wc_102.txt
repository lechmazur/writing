<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mei’s interiority is concrete and her motivation is clear, but the characterization lacks contradictory impulses or a visible personal cost at closure, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change under a causal lens, and orientation is immediate. The cost, however, is more atmospheric than personally felt by Mei, slightly limiting impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and charges the final image, but it does not actively constrain choices. Capped because Q2 is below 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation is driven by Mei's agency, but the cost of healing remains abstract rather than a tangible trade-off for the protagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Capped due to Q2 not reaching 9.0.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctively lyrical, with controlled rhythm. Capped because Q2 is below 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative but generally purposeful; some metaphorical stacking near peak beats slightly risks clarity without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of spiritual photography and past-life memory feels fresh and specific, though the execution leans on lyrical abstraction. Capped due to Q2.</comment>
