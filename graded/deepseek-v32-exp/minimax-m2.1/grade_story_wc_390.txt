<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of logic and visceral terror act simultaneously in scene; final tuning choice is earned by training and legacy, with cost visible in exhaustion. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in bone-deep weight and crystallizing breath. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional complexity is shown, not summarized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: warped tone necessitates tuning, therefore she adapts with the key, resulting in sonic absolution. Closure is a decisive change (harbor saved) with felt cost in her slump and relief. Orientation is immediate and precise; persistent constraint of time and crystal's shift escalates pressure coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: drift-ice marina and lighthouse pressure choices via groaning ice, bitter wind, and fading sunset. The crystal and key function as micro-settings that constrain action and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Maren's expertise (e.g., "temperature was dropping faster than her models had predicted").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protecting harbor) is signaled early and tightens via warping crystal tone and plummeting temperature. Escalation is driven by Maren's agency under causal lens: she must adapt tuning in real-time. Cost is legible in her exhaustion and the visceral memory of past failure, foreclosing the path of inaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of logic/feeling synthesis emerges through specific events and images, not statement; final paragraph's "logically emotional" resonates without moralizing. Subtext operates in the contrast between mathematical theory and haunting memory. The ending offers a non-literal answer through the image of eternal vigilance, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt; voice blends technical precision with lyrical observation, reflecting Maren's expertise and emotional weight. Perceptual signature is distinct—noticing frequency shifts and "jagged and wrong" tones. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., precise tuning mechanics) is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and sentence openings. Information density is high (e.g., "logical assessment of consequences intertwined with something far more visceral"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; peak beats remain clear. Read-aloud ear test passes with natural cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse keeper trope with sonic science and ice-bound setting; the marriage of logic and emotion transforms familiar legacy narrative. Specificity in vibrational matching and crypt keeper's key feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in blending technical and ethereal tones heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
