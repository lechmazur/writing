<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's isolation and variant allegiance are embodied through concrete micro-choices (pressing ear, cracked smile, walking to the portico) and a clear hierarchy of values. The final hope feels earned by her endurance and the portico's crack, though some traits are stated ("lonely visionary") rather than solely shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a decisive change (prophet's arrival) with cost legible in the cracked portico and crystallized hope. Orientation is immediate; causality is driven by storm intensification and radio clarity, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and selective (cold brass, static hiss, cobalt fire). The portico functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (touch, gaze) and charges the final image with its crack and glow, deeply integrated with POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens via storm intensity and radio fragments tightens toward the prophet's arrival. Agency is clear in Elara's attentive listening and approach; cost is felt in her isolation and the portico's fracture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of light from ancient shadows emerges through concrete images (portico, radio static, storm) without moralizing. The final arrival offers a non-literal answer, reweighting prior material with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature. Voice modulates with pressure, maintaining rhythmic control and purposeful compression; radio dialogue is integrated as prophetic fragment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("like dying wasps") is coherent and serves atmosphere; sentence variety supports propulsion. No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Synthesis of isolated visionary, magical radio, and stormlit prophecy feels fresh and specific. The cobalt glass portico and variant allegiance transform familiar tropes into an organic, inevitable closure.</comment>
