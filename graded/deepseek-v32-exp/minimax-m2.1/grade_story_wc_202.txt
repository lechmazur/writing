<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Protagonist’s interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion; the final choice to wear the fragment is earned by prior causality (grandmother’s gift, years of carrying, alchemist’s revelation) and carries visible cost in accepting the legacy. Minor deduction for relatively smooth internal conflict, but contradictory impulses are present in the shift from passive keeper to active bridge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is clear within 120 words. Closure lands with a decisive change (wearing the fragment as a relay) and resonant reconfiguration, cost legible in the acceptance of responsibility and the grandmother’s anchored approval. The fragment’s elusive tangibility serves as a persistent constraint that shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (alchemist’s market, fragment as micro-setting) is vividly filtered through the protagonist’s perception, constrains choice, and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, supporting the liminal atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (search for meaning/purpose) is signaled early; escalation is driven by protagonist’s agency in seeking the alchemist and receiving the revelation, leading to a meaningful tightening—the decision to become a bridge—with unmistakable cost in the acceptance of a lifelong role.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of legacy and intuition emerges through events and images, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer (the fragment as beacon of intuition) that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in the grandmother’s gift, the hidden painting, and the final refraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First‑person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (translator of the in‑between); voice is consistently poetic and reflective, modulating under pressure without head‑hopping. Minimal dialogue feels natural and goal‑driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence‑level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and the closing image is clear and charged. Read‑aloud ear test passes flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar elements (lighthouse, market, legacy) feels fresh and inevitable; the concept of intuition as a solid beam and the between‑worlds translator role are specific and risk‑taking, heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
