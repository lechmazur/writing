<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mira’s patience and perceptiveness are consistently shown through concrete actions (handling the stamp, noticing marginalia), and her final resolve is earned by the discoveries. However, interior emotion is somewhat summarized rather than fully embodied in peak beats, and the cost of her commitment remains implicit, not viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with Mira’s resolve crystallizing; the accumulative/textural lens holds firmly. Cost is implied but not sharply legible in a single on-page sentence, slightly limiting impact. Structure is clean, with orientation anchored early and causality intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and actively shapes the story: the blackout forces candlelight perception, the submerged library and the ink stamp constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and fully filtered through Mira’s professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving truth) escalate through Mira’s agency under the accumulative lens—from noticing a pattern to uncovering a hidden archive. A meaningful tightening occurs when she tests the stamp, and the final resolve reweights the dominant stake with implied, though not sharply visible, cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth hidden in plain sight emerges organically from particulars (marginalia, stamp, blackout) without statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mira’s resolve to continue annotating, avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct lyrical texture; Mira’s perceptual signature—logical, accumulative—shapes every observation. No dialogue, but prose rhythm and diction are controlled and consistent, supporting the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and precise, with high information density and no repetitive scaffolding or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with discovery beats; the final paragraph lands with resonant imagery without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and specific: hidden archive built in marginalia within a submerged city library. The synthesis feels organic and inevitable; risk-taking in the quiet, intellectual conflict heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the perspective is memorable.</comment>
