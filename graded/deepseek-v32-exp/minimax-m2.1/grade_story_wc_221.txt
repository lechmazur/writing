<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictions like "blessed pariah" driving micro-choices; her final renunciation of confusion for exploration is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the peace that merges blessing and burden.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with cost legible in "the blessing and the burden... merged into something like peace"; orientation anchored early, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting and objects (observation deck, compass rose, sketchbook) constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory details are selective and filtered through Mira's POV, enhancing atmosphere without generic placeholder.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confusion vs. exploration) tightens via accumulative density; protagonist's agency in the glimpse and sketching reweights options with cost felt in the final image of peace under the textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like sketching and compass rose; ending offers non-literal answer ("true north was... a way of moving") that reweights prior material without moralizing, subtext in silence and tradition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; poetic diction fits Mira's expertise and emotional state, no head-hopping, purposeful compression in glimpses taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language ("echoed silence") is consistent and clear, no register drift or artifice obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of temporal sci-fi and personal tradition feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric reflection heightens stakes, specifics like time dilation and sketching are irreplaceable, transforming tropes.</comment>
