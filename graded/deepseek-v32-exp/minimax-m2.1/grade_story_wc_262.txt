<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her trait as a sensate seeker; interiority is embodied (e.g., "tears on her cheeks"), and her final choice to leave the film strip is earned by the vision's cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression feels genuine under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost ("tears on her cheeks... particular peace"). Orientation is anchored early; the film strip's memory deepens coherently toward the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through Mira's POV; the projection booth and film strip charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, though the environment does not heavily constrain choice—micro-setting still essential for atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, escalation occurs via density of vision and emotional weight; Mira's agency in witnessing drives the stake. Cost is legible in her tears and realization, foreclosing intervention with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of unused love and unwitnessed goodbyes emerges organically from particulars; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through image and silence (e.g., "goodbye letters existed not as documents but as doorways").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mira; voice has a distinct perceptual signature ("spatially imaginative mind maps these invisible landscapes"). Lyrical prose modulates with emotional intensity, no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with high information density and rhythmic control. No loops or scaffold; figurative language ("hushed thunder") is purposeful and consistent. Peak beats maintain clarity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes psychometry, emotional residue, and unwitnessed endings with specificity; feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative, lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation of tropes through grounded detail.</comment>
