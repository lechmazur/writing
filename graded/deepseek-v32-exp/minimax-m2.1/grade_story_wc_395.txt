<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren's "brightly attentive" trait is consistently shown through her pattern recognition and investigation, motivating her final choice to trace the deleted files. The internal conflict between restoring Yuki or letting the absence remain is summarized rather than fully dramatized in scene, which keeps the score from the highest band. However, her micro-choices (enlarging the patch, following numbers) and the earned decision with implied cost anchor a strong characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change—Maren begins to trace where deleted files go—with clear cost implied by entering "the silence where the company had hidden what it could not bear to remember." Causal lens holds tightly from inciting incident through discovery to choice. The recurring numbers and patch create a persistent constraint that shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The social network archive and server farm are vividly rendered through selective sensory detail (echoing songs, digital ghosts) and actively pressure Maren's choices. The mission patch functions as a micro-setting that constrains her investigation and charges the final image with its recurring constellation. Setting is fully integrated with plot and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the truth about Yuki—escalates cleanly under a causal lens: Maren's agency drives each tightening (noticing patterns, breaching firewalls, discovering the lie). The final choice to trace the files forecloses inaction with undeniable risk. Cost is legible in the closing sentence's ominous silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of digital persistence and corporate secrecy emerges organically from concrete particulars (abandoned profiles, song echoes, encoded numbers). The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer through Maren's commitment to follow the numbers, reweighting prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext about data afterlife and human connection is consistently implied.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third‑person limited POV is stable and filtered through Maren's attentiveness, with a distinct perceptual signature (noticing "digital ghost images," patterns in static). The prose rhythm and diction are controlled, modulating from lyrical description to compressed urgency. No head‑hopping; elision (e.g., the exact breach of firewalls) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is exceptional: sentences are dense and propulsive, doing multiple jobs (e.g., the server‑farm description establishes atmosphere, theme, and method). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; syntax varies naturally with the beat. The final image lands with clarity and rhythmic force.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of corporate archive, cold‑case investigation, and distributed consciousness feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes (missing researcher, corporate cover‑up) are transformed through specific, grounded details (song‑echo encoding, patch constellation). Risk‑taking in the poetic, conceptual leap to Yuki's spread consciousness heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
