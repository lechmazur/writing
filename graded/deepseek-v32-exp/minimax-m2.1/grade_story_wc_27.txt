<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kira's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses between waiting and acting resolved in an earned choice to reclaim purpose. The shift from performed to earned confidence carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in her resolved stance; causal lens holds tightly from reflection to decision, anchored early without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting and objects (opera glasses, stone circle) constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory detail is selective, woven through action, and essential to the closure effect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kira's agency under the causal lens, from passive stargazing to active decision; cost is legible in her transformed confidence and the burden of reigniting the rebellion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through image and action, with a resonant non-literal answer at the end; slight explicitness in the "meaning" line prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is consistently poetic and reflective, modulating with emotional pressure without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold; figurative language ("thunderous serenity") is voice-motivated and clear, supporting closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sci-fi and mystical elements feels inevitable; specific details transform rebellion tropes through character-driven stakes, with risk-taking that heightens coherence.</comment>
