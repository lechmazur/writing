<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is concrete via performative narration versus private grief; final defiant blankness earns cost through prior causality. Slight diagnostic self-awareness ("I am morally ambiguous") is a hairline slip but integrated into reflective voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in "defiantly blank" face and "weightlessness of having survived both." Orientation anchors early; mandate constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Turbines and farmhouse pressure choices and charge the final image; sensory detail (hum, shadows, wood curls) is selective and POV-filtered. Micro-setting (knife, dried flowers) constrains action and deepens memorial theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (emotional authenticity vs. mandated joy) tighten via accumulative density of whittling and narration; agency in gaming system leads to cost—peace in void forecloses both grief and false happiness. Escalation driven by protagonist's choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (whittling as grief, narration as defiance) without moralizing; ending reweights prior material with resonant image of "defiantly blank" face and "weightlessness," offering non-literal answer to emotional regulation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV stable with distinct perceptual signature—theatrical, precise, performer's lexicon. Voice modulates under pressure (narrating to walls) and elision (mandate mechanics) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high density and rhythmic control; sentences advance story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("curl spirals free like a falling thought") is purposeful and clear. No artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise (happiness mandate, performer gaming system) feels fresh through specific synthesis; risk-taking in quiet, reflective style heightens stakes. Transformation of tropes via grounded character choices and inevitable closure.</comment>
