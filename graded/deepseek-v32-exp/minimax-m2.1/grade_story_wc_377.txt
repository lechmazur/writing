<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her history, with embodied emotion in micro-choices like feeling Juniper's approval as a "warm cloak." However, internal contradiction is minimal; her stance is consistent, lacking the contradictory impulses in scene that would elevate to 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the sculpture moving in truth and Elara's satisfaction; cost is legible in the seasonal muteness and preservation effort. Accumulative/textural lens holds, orientation is clear early, and the ending reweights meaning without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated, with Whispering Bluff and the kinetic sculpture constraining choices and charging the final image. The iceberg fragment functions as a micro-setting that deepens the closure; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving wonder) escalates through the sculpture's completion and Juniper's arrival, leading to a deepening under the accumulative lens. Agency is in Elara's tuning and attention, with cost felt in her seasonal muteness and the effort to capture truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions—truth as convergence, silence as fullness—without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the sculpture's movement, avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct lyrical voice that reflects Elara's perception. Prose rhythm and diction are controlled, and any elision (like the lack of dialogue) is purposeful and taught, supporting the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no scaffold or loops. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, accelerating with the closure image; read-aloud test passes with varied sentence structures.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and specific—a world beyond words where truth is symphonic—synthesized through grounded details like the iceberg fragment and kinetic sculptures. Risk-taking in structure and tone heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
