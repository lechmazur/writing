<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (understanding rune resistance) is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her final choice. Interiority is concrete (trembling hands, crystallizing tears) and the contradiction between scholarly cynicism and inherited belief acts simultaneously. The final renunciation of force in favor of intuition is earned by the flashback and self-acceptance beat. Minor deduction for a touch of diagnostic label-speak ("The crystals were not a curse...") in an otherwise embodied peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is clear and held, building density through sensory pressure and internal realization. Orientation is immediate and precise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she completes the rune as the storm breaks, having reconfigured her relationship to her gifts and past. The cost—shedding cynicism and fear—is legible on the page in the final paragraph's "she had shed her cynicism along with her fear."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the floating platform isolates her, the gathering storm pressures the timeframe, and the crow quill is the essential tool. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (ozone, worn stone, gray light). The environment charges the final image, with the platform suspended between storms mirroring her internal poised transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mastering the runes through self-acceptance) is signaled early and escalates cleanly under the accumulative lens via the storm's approach and her crystallizing trait. Protagonist agency drives the final deepening: she chooses to draw from memory, not textbooks. The cost is the shedding of her scholarly identity's protective cynicism, felt in the final realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (transforming personal wounds into authentic art) emerges organically from scars, crystals, and failed translations. Subtext operates through potent images (the quill "that knew her name"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the completed, luminous runes, reweighting prior struggles without moralizing. The integration of superstition, scholarship, and body magic feels seamless.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and deeply embedded. The voice has a distinct lyrical texture with a perceptual signature attuned to pressure and metaphor ("a gray wall of waiting thunder"). Rhythmic control is excellent, modulating with emotional intensity. Slight register elevation at peaks is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and propulsive, with high information density. Figurative language is consistent and coherent. No loops, scaffolds, or synonym churn. A single minor artifact: the phrase "saturated hush" in the final paragraph is slightly decorative, but it does not obscure the closure image or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of fantasy elements (floating rocks, rune magic, bodily crystallization) feels fresh and organic, transformed by the specific, grounded emotional arc of artistic struggle and acceptance. The lyric, accumulative structure is a bold risk that heightens stakes and coheres perfectly. The ending feels inevitable in hindsight, born from the established particulars of character and world.</comment>
