<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies from curiosity to crystallized purpose; interiority is concrete through actions like cataloguing and experimenting. The final capture of her own dream is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her lifelong ache of absence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with cost as her dream is "finally home"; accumulative/textural lens holds throughout with pattern of longing and capture; orientation is clear early with who, where, when anchored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid setting and the watercolor palette as object constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, supporting the magical realism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency from accidental discovery to purposeful vitalization; cost is legible in the ache of absence resolved, with one meaningful tightening when she sees the child's photo.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of longing emerges through particulars like the palette and photographs; ending offers a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, with the final image reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature reflects Mira's attentive nature, and prose rhythm controls pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or scaffolds, and figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh premise of magical palette and photograph vitalization; specific synthesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical magic realism that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
