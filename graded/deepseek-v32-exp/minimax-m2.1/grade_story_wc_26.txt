<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is precise and embodied, her "softly deliberate" nature filtering through every action. The river stone and memory gaps create interior contradiction, and her final vigil is an earned endurance. However, the sharp-eyed observation does not translate into a decisive on-page choice under pressure, slightly limiting agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens held flawlessly; closure is a Charged Poise where Mira's understanding of hope's metamorphosis crystallizes. The river stone's warmth at the end provides a tangible cost of her preserved tactile memory. Orientation is immediate, and the single-scene structure is taut.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The blooming library and the river stone are not just vivid but indispensable: the library pressures her archival duty, the stone charges the final image with the cost of the unbinding. Sensory detail is selective and entirely filtered through Mira's dusk-noticer perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a deepening density: Mira's comparison of footage tightens into the realization that hope is transforming, not lost. The cost is legible in the mother's dissolution and the stone's warmth. No external antagonist needed; stakes are philosophically potent and personally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the juxtaposition of footage, stone, and Mira's vigil. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—hope metamorphoses—without moralizing. The conceptual repricing of the Unbinding as a transformation rather than a loss is earned through specific, concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply internal; the voice is a distinct perceptual signature ("dusk noticer," "liminal hours"). Lyrical compression is taught and paid off at closure. No dialogue, but the prose rhythm and syntax consistently reflect Mira's deliberate, luminous attention.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and flawlessly propelled. High information density with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("luminous threads," "hope accumulated in corners") is consistent and sharp. Sentence-level rhythm supports the accumulative, meditative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of archival sci-fi and literary meditation. The concept of unbinding shadows is transformed through Mira's specific, tactile perspective. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes and coheres into a singular, authentic vision.</comment>
