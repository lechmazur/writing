<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Characterization is concrete and earned; the archivist's interiority shows contradiction between dread and discovery, and her final shift to understanding is motivated by prior causality with visible cost in the transformation of purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Plot structure under an accumulative lens builds to a resonant reconfiguration; closure lands with conceptual cost in the realization that meaning resides in the act of seeking, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice; the frozen library's quartz hush and delicate magic pressure her meticulous actions, and the environment charges the final image with wonder.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through her agency; the discovery that vows are transforming, not fading, reweights the dominant stake from preservation to understanding, with cost legible in her renewed purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the vault's transformation; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer about meaning persisting in story, without moralizing, earned through her measured realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with a lyrical, precise perceptual signature that reflects her meticulous nature; POV is stable and filters all detail through her specialized awareness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense without artifacts; rhythm varies purposefully, figurative language is integrated, and no loops or scaffold obscure the closure's clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality is high in synthesizing magic and archival science; the fresh angle on preservation vs. memory feels inevitable, and risk-taking in quiet internal conflict heightens stakes.</comment>
