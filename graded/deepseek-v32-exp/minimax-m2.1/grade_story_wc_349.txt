<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, rooted in professional observation. The final conceptual shift is earned by on-page exploration, though emotional embodiment leans abstract at peak realization, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing ("illuminate the gaps") with felt cost in the reconfigured purpose. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds from start to finish, taught by the patterned imagery of absence and potential.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The glass orchard library is not just vivid description; it functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice (selecting bottles) and decisively charges the final image, making it indispensable to the story's logic and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates via density of observation leading to a crystallized realization. The vendor's agency (selecting bottles, redefining her purpose) deepens the stake, with cost legible in the reconfigured understanding of her work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges wholly from the story's unique logic—narratives born from absence—without statement or moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights every prior image with profound conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: a vendor's analytical yet lyrical attention. Voice is consistently textured, and purposeful compression ("Incise by quantifying absence") is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and purposeful, with high information density. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion matches the accumulative, reflective pace, though a few abstractions ("quiet recognition") slightly soften the peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The core premise—a library of unborn stories and a vendor who quantifies absence—is a singular, organic synthesis. It commits fully to its conceptual risks, transforming a familiar archetype through specific, irreplaceable world logic and a quietly bold climax.</comment>
