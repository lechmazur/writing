<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mara's curiosity and functional creativity are clear and consistent, motivating her exploration and plan. However, interiority occasionally slips into telling ("She was functionally creative, always had been"), and the emotional cost of her choice is more conceptual than viscerally felt, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Causal progression from discovery to proposal is clean, and closure lands with a resonant Conceptual Repricing of the spaceport's purpose. Cost is legible in the shift from abandonment to renewal, though not deeply personal. Orientation is immediate, and the hybrid lens (causal with accumulative texture) holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice (cracked walls, sediment blockages). The sextant piece as a micro-setting object charges the final image, and sensory detail is selective and purposeful, woven through action and reflection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes (community renewal) escalate through Mara's agency from exploration to approved plan. A meaningful tightening occurs as her calculations lead to a concrete proposal. Cost is present in effort and time, but lacks high personal friction or visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of renewal and redefined navigation emerges organically from particulars like the sextant and water-flow calculations. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though some reflective passages edge toward explicitness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with a voice that blends engineering precision and poetic wonder. No dialogue, but narration consistently filters through Mara's perception, with controlled diction and rhythm that support the reflective tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with varied syntax and high information density. A few abstract phrases ("psychological architecture as complex as the physical tunnels") risk mild overwriting, but no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle disrupt momentum or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of abandoned spaceport, civil engineer, and navigational artifact feels fresh and inevitable. Quiet, conceptual risk in the ending heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the perspective is memorably grounded in specific detail.</comment>
