<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Seraphina's dedication and transformation are clear and earned, but interior contradiction is absent; her steady resolve lacks the contradictory impulses that would elevate to the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal drive holds cleanly from prophecy to discovery, and closure lands with a decisive change; however, the cost of transformation is implied rather than legibly felt on the page, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail and the moonstone tool charge the final image, but the high-band gate is capped due to Q2's score, limiting the rating despite strong execution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation is driven by agency, but the tightening does not force a palpable trade-off or cost on the page, keeping it from the highest tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars like the tiny monuments, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal reweighting; capped due to Q2 score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical POV with a distinct perceptual signature; no head-hopping or elision issues, but capped by the global gate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dense, rhythmic prose with purposeful figurative language and no scaffold loops; minor risk of overwriting ("mossy delight") but clarity remains, capped by Q2.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folklore and ecological duty feels inevitable; specific details and risk-taking in voice elevate, but capped by the global gate.</comment>
