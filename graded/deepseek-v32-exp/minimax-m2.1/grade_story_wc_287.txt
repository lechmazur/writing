<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied; her wistful pragmatism drives micro-choices like inviting the girl up and planting the cutting, earning her final stance through prior causality with visible cost in shared grief and hope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a Charged Poise with the image of "something already stirring" reconfiguring loss into renewal, cost legible in the acceptance of waiting and the act of planting. Orientation clear by ~120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (fire escape, harbor, rosebush) constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, with the gauge tooth as micro-setting reweighting meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is emotional resilience; escalation via the girl's arrival deepens through Maren's agency to comfort and plant, tightening the theme with cost felt in the shared vulnerability and hopeful action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of loss and renewal emerges through particulars like the rosebush and gauge tooth; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the stirring beneath ground, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct lyrical voice; perception filtered through Maren's bias; dialogue natural and subtextual; rhythmic control supports pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with varied rhythm and high information density; no loops or scaffold; figurative language ("红色叹息") is effective and does not muddle peak beats; minor translation artifact but clarity intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief and gardening through specific details (gauge tooth, fire escape); risk-taking in quiet plot heightens stakes without gimmickry; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
