<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her role; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion under pressure. Her final choice—unraveling the final knot—is earned by prior causality, and the cost is visible in the breaking of silence and personal reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate, drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds throughout. Closure lands with palpable cost as the interlaced hush breaks and Mira sees her childhood reflection, reconfiguring meaning in a resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice; the prism sanctuary's light and silence pressure Mira's actions, and the net as micro-setting charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mira's active unraveling of knots, each release tightening pressure under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the spirit's release and Mira's revelation, driven by her agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images of light, silence, and masks; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext is rich in gestures like the unmasking and broken hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with stable close third-person POV; perceptual signature is consistent, and rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and varied syntax; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats like the final unraveling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mask restoration and spirit release feels inevitable; specific details like the tapestry needle and prism sanctuary create freshness without gimmickry. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes.</comment>
