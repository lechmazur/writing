<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and her motivation to understand collective grief is clear, rooted in her relationship with her grandmother. Her "fiercely meditative" focus and micro-choices (leaving tools, reading poems, speaking aloud) reveal character under pressure. The final realization is earned by the accumulative sensory and reflective details, and her acceptance of spectral mentorship feels credible. A slight telling in the epiphany ("She understood now...") prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early; a single-scene, accumulative/textural drive lens holds throughout. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing) as Elara's insight reweights her understanding of grief and her craft, with cost legible in the final image of butterflies and the ghost's smile. The persistent constraint of the migration timeframe and the greenhouse environment shapes tactics and charges the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse is vividly rendered through selective sensory detail (warmth, light, sound) and functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. The environment is filtered through Elara's POV and mirrors her internal state. Its physicality and atmosphere are integral to the closure, making it indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to understand collective grief—is signaled early and escalates through accumulative density (poems, butterflies, ghost). Agency lies in Elara's attentive retracing and reading, which deepens her knowledge and leads to a reconfigured stance. The cost is the acceptance of grief as a moving, communal force, felt in her return to carving. The escalation is subtle but coherent under the textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars (gravestones, greenhouse, migration, poems) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: grief moves like weather, and carvings are way stations for memory. Subtext operates through image and implication, and the final realization reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and close, with a distinct lyrical and meditative perceptual signature. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and the prose rhythm supports the accumulative drive. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure. The narrative stance remains consistent and effective throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density and varied rhythm. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere without loops or scaffolding. A minor moment of slight overwriting ("the humming warmth inside match the drumming stillness in her chest") prevents a 9.0, but figurative language is otherwise coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravestone carver, greenhouse, butterfly migration, and spectral mentorship feels fresh and inevitable. The perspective on collective grief is specific and non-obvious, transformed through grounded, character-driven choices. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure reconfigures prior material with originality.</comment>
