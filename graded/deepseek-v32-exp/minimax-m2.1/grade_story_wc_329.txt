<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and drives the story, but interior contradiction is minimal, reducing depth; final choice is earned with visible cost in the orchard's transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost in the statues' movement; accumulative lens holds; orientation is anchored early and payoff is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image via the orchard and locust shell; sensory details are vivid, selective, and filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early; escalation via Elara's agency tightens through music, reweighting beauty with cost in the statues' response, though cost is subtle.</comment>
