<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's affectionate skepticism is embodied in concrete contradiction (hope warring with skepticism) and drives micro-choices; her final decision to devise a gentler method is earned by somatic experience with visible cost in the "willowglass hope." No diagnostic label-speak intrudes on peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in "willowglass hope—fragile, translucent, trembling." Orientation is clear within 120 words; geode constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective (purple glow, cold metal); the muscovite geode sliver functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (pressed to temple) and charges the final image, elevating beyond mere atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding authentic connection) escalates through Mira's somatic markers and agency; cost is unmistakable in the fragile hope of the ending, tightening under the accumulative lens without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of consent vs. intrusion emerges through particulars (geode vs. pills); final image "willowglass hope" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet precise, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., telepathy pill recall) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; minor overwriting in "fractally precise" repetition slightly dulls momentum but does not touch closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathy critique and crystalline illumination feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details (muscovite, light painting) anchor originality.</comment>
