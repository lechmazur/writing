<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Yara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied interiority. Her final choice to stay and integrate is earned by the arbor's vision, which forces her to confront her pattern of giving without receiving. The cost is visible in the shift from aching to anticipation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Yara crystallizes her decision to weave into the community, with cost legible in the arbor's truth and the final image of new spiral marks. Orientation is clear early; the pattern of search and revelation tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and filters through Yara's perception. The obsidian arbor constrains choice and charges the final image, forcing a transformative realization. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven into action and emotion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (belonging) escalates through the arbor's vision, a deepening that changes knowledge and forces a stance crystallization. Yara's agency drives the escalation; the cost of learning to ask as well as give is unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of mutual kinship emerges through concrete images and events, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: belonging is a practice of weaving, reweighting Yara's past and future. No moralizing; subtext operates in the spiral marks and vision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and the prose rhythm supports pressure. No head-hopping; elision (Threader's identity) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates and breathes with scene needs, and the final line recharges prior motifs without artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elements (crystalline orchard, Threader as practice, marsh-reed sculptor) feels organic and inevitable. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates; risk-taking in lyrical heightening pays off with stakes and coherence intact.</comment>
