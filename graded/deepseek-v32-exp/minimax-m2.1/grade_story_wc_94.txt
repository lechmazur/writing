<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deep with embodied contradiction like "furiously tranquil." Her final realization is earned by prior causality, showing cost in years of silence. No stock phrasing; interiority is concrete and character-particular, and micro-choices under pressure reveal her hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, structure builds through reflective density to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands with cost in healing scars, and the storm observatory setting persistently shapes the final image. Orientation is clear early; lens holds without ambiguity, and the cost is legible in the moment of writing new verses.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated, with the storm and observatory charging every beat. The environment constrains choice and mirrors internal state, culminating in the final image of writing on glass. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtering through Mira's POV, and the micro-setting of the timer and envelope adds tactile pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Mira's internal conflict between silence and expression. Escalation occurs through the storm's intensity and her agency in reading verses, leading to a decisive realization with legible cost in her scars beginning to heal. Under accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images like "cartography of scars" and the vigil. Subtext is rich in gestures and silence, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through healing without moralizing. The core concept integrates seamlessly with character arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is consistently poetic and filtered through Mira's perception, with rhythmic control under pressure. POV is stable third-person limited, and elision is purposeful, teaching the accumulative pattern paid off at closure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and enhances clarity, with high information density and propulsion that accelerates towards the closure image. No figurative muddle in peak beats; sentence-level rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the specific synthesis of a censored poet's vigil in a stormlit observatory. Details like the darkroom timer and bus timetable are irreplaceable, and emotional truth is grounded in particular lived experience. Risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
