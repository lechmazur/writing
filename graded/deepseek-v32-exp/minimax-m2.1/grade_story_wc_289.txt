<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and her motivation clear, moving from secret-keeper to weaver of connection via the nest's discovery. The change is earned, with embodied emotion and micro-choices (retrieving the nest, planning the installation). Lacks contradictory impulses in scene, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (realization she's a weaver of connection) with felt cost in transforming secrecy into public gift. Accumulative lens holds; orientation is immediate. The nest discovery triggers idea naturally, but cost is subtle, not a persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—lotus temple, pond, nest—with sensory detail filtered through Mira's perception. The thrush's nest as object charges the final image and inspires the installation, meeting the 9+ gate for constraining choice or charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal meaning-finding, escalating accumulatively through reflection and discovery to her decision to create the installation. Agency drives the turn, with conceptual cost (transforming her role). Cost is legible but not heavy, keeping it below 9.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of connection emerges through nest and letters, subtext rich, ending offers resonant non-literal answer ("the thread that connected all things"). Earned through concrete particulars; avoids moralizing, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct lyrical voice, perceptual signature sharp (e.g., noticing the nest's "mathematical secret"). No head-hopping; prose rhythm controls pressure. Purposeful compression in reflection integrates seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished, high information density, varied syntax, no artifacts or loops. Figurative language consistent and purposeful, rhythm supports accumulative drive. Closure image remains crystal clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise of love-letter ghostwriter creating nest from letters is fresh and specific, synthesis feels inevitable. Emotional truth anchors risk-taking in quiet reflection; transformation avoids template.</comment>
