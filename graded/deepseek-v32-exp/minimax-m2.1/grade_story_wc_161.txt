<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation is deeply rooted in grief and her courier background, with interiority concrete and contradictions acting in scene. Her final realization about trust is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the closing lines.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds seamlessly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) where the cost of learning to trust is legible on-page. Orientation is immediate, and structure fits the scope with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choice: the attic's skylight and dust motes constrain Eleanor's method and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her POV, mirroring internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes center on Eleanor's internal conflict with grief and trust; escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by her agency in reconstructing the songs, with cost unmistakable in the climax of playing the recording.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the meteorite chip and pigeons, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on trust as a practice. Subtext operates through image and implication without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, reflective, and attentive to dust motes and memory. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and prose rhythm supports pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops or artifacts; figurative language is consistent and heightens clarity, especially in peak beats like the final realization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of meteorite memory encoding, courier pigeons, and grief, all transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
