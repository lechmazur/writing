<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira's face-blindness and pattern perception are concretely embodied and motivate her selection and actions. Her interiority is specific, but the absence of contradictory impulses or internal conflict limits depth. The final realization is earned by her task, though the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: the condemned building necessitates the commission, the coin discovery guides the preservation method, and the deadline forces the night-long work. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing ("limits did not exist") with cost legible in the demolition's sound and the transformed ceiling. The time constraint persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ancient oak library is a vivid, micro-setting that pressures choice via the demolition deadline and supplies the coin and canvas. Sensory details (smell of dry knowledge, tree's breathing) are selective and POV-filtered. The setting and coin directly constrain action and charge the final image of the painted ceiling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preservation before demolition) is signaled early and tightens via the approaching dawn. Mira's agency drives escalation: finding the coin and painting the ceiling. Cost is legible in the wrecking ball's breach and her departure, though the transformative outcome slightly mutes the felt sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of preservation through transformation emerges organically from the coin, the painting, and the library's fate. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the ceiling's overlapping skies. A slight thematic echo in the final line ("discovery that limits did not exist") nudges toward statement but remains earned by prior events.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with a distinct lyrical and precise voice matching Mira's perceptual signature. No dialogue; prose rhythm modulates with the quiet intensity of the task. Purposeful elision (the guild's specifics) is taught and coherent, maintaining focus on Mira's immediate experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("fractally precise architecture," "slow breathing in the grain") is consistent and enhances clarity. Sentence-level rhythm supports the heightened stillness and culminating realization. No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of face-blind artist, tree library, and star-map coin feels inevitable and fresh. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded details and a thematic focus on perception and translation. Risk-taking in the quiet, conceptual closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
