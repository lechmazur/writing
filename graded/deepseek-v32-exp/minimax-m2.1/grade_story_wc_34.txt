<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as a balladeer is clear and embodied; her final choice to sing with the ghost is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the articulation of unspoken needs. Interiority is concrete without stock phrasing, and her actions align under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration as songs merge, with cost legible in "the unspoken needs... found their articulation." Orientation is clear early, and the ghost's code persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Misty courtyard and bolt plate constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered. The setting pressures actions through lightning timing and mist, integral to the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes of unspoken needs escalate through density increase under accumulative lens; Mira's agency in encoding and singing drives a meaningful tightening, with cost unmistakable in the final harmony.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions; ending offers a non-literal answer through the merging of songs, resisting moralizing. Subtext operates in ghost code and graffiti, inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature as a balladeer; lyrical prose controlled under pressure, no head-hopping. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, supporting the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density without loops or scaffold; figurative language serves voice and clarity, e.g., "tinkersong wonder." Rhythm varies naturally, advancing story and atmosphere with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost in code, balladeer legacy, and graffiti art feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details like phosphorescent salts ground the premise.</comment>
