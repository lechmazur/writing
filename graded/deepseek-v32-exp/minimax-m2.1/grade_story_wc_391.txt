<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kira's motivation and transformation are clear and embodied, earned through decades of work. The final unyoking is motivated by prior causality with visible cost. However, contradictory impulses are not dramatized in the immediate scene, preventing a perfect score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens builds to a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost on the page. Orientation is immediate, and the lens holds without ambiguity. Closure lands with the patient revolution flowering, reweighting the journey itself.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary and frozen lake are indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are vivid, selective, and filtered through Kira's perception, with the viaduct and ice serving as active elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (the patient revolution) escalates under the accumulative lens through increased density and the viaduct's call. Kira's agency drives the unyoking, with cost legible in her decades of sculpted patience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of patience and revolution emerges organically from imagery and action, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer. The ending reweights prior material without moralizing, offering a conceptual repricing of the journey.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with controlled rhythmic prose that matches Kira's perceptual signature. POV is stable and consistent, and the accumulative pattern is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and varied syntax. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. The closure image remains clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography, magnetic viaducts, and patient revolution feels inevitable. Specific details and a singular artistic stance avoid cliché, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
