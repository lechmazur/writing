<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Summoner's motivation is clear and embodied; interiority is concrete via micro-choices like tracing silence. However, contradictory impulses are subtle rather than dramatized in scene, preventing the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost legible in the crane wing's journey and her "tranquil blaze" understanding. Orientation is immediate, structure seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and actively constrains choice—the brook's whispers and silence are integral to the ritual. The origami wing as micro-setting charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist's agency in mapping silence, tightening under the accumulative lens. Cost is felt in the transformation of prophecy into wisdom, though the price is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of prophecy as frequency; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the crane wing carried downstream.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct—lyrical, perceptual signature focused on silence and vibration. Rhythmic control supports pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or scaffolds. Minor elevation in diction ("terrestrially cosmic") fits the voice and does not muddy peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of smoothing hush to quiet prophecy is a fresh synthesis; risk-taking in lyrical accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
