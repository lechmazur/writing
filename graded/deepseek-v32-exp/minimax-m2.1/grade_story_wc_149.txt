<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's ghostly perseverance and mournful elation are concretely embodied; her motivation to repay the debt drives every choice, with the final near-release earned by centuries of service. The cost is felt in the transfer of the "loving venom" and the gardener's inherited burden.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative texture builds to a charged poise closure where the debt shifts and dawn approaches; orientation is immediate, lens holds, and cost is legible in the gardener's tears and the bead's warmth. No causality breaks, and the persistent constraint of the debt shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The alchemical greenhouse functions as a micro-setting that constrains and enables Elara's actions; its endless night and artificial moons charge the final image of approaching dawn with tangible pressure. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, fully integrated into the POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The stake—freedom from debt—escalates through Elara's ephemeral interventions, culminating in the decisive transfer to the gardener; agency under accumulative lens tightens with each ghost-touch, cost visible in the silver bark and the gardener's emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of debt, growth, and release emerges through specific images—the bead, the grafted scions, the ashen veil—without moralizing; the ending reconfirms that awakening life awakens debt, a resonant non-literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV anchored in Elara's perception yields a distinct lyrical voice; rhythm and diction modulate with her ghostly state, no head-hopping, and the gardener's brief appearance is cleanly focalized through Elara. Perceptual signature is strong and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dense, figurative prose is pattern-taught and pays off at closure; no loops or scaffold, high information density, and sentences propel the accumulative rhythm without obscuring cause or cost. Figurative language is consistent and supports the lyrical tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of ghost bride, alchemical orchard, and centuries-spanning debt feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical compression and mournful tone heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details and emotional truth anchor the originality.</comment>
