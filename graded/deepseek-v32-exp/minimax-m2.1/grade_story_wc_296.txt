<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's guarded solitude and hubris-driven failure are embodied in concrete micro-choices; his final renunciation of reputation for growth is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("the other druids would know of his failure").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in the pool reflection and the plant's hunger converting poison to soil.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard vortex pressures every move, from moss-slick rocks to the cursed lake; the setting constrains choice (expanding circles crack ice) and charges the final image of the still pool reflecting a weathered face.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redemption) escalates via Kaelen's agency: unbending posture shatters the frozen confession, planting the seed consumes residue; cost is unmistakable in lost reputation and transformed shame.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: "frozen confession" and "what mirrors don't show" reweight failure into growth; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the flesh-eating plant's pale shoot and the druid's smile.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct druidic-perceptual signature; voice modulates from lyrical vortex to serene focus, and elision (e.g., "finding was not the same as fixing") is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, advancing story with high information density; no loops or scaffold issues, though a minor typo ("his動作") does not obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of druidic magic and psychological redemption; the flesh-eating seed from a corpse used for renewal and the "frozen confession" concept feel inevitable in hindsight, risking serenity amid violence.</comment>
