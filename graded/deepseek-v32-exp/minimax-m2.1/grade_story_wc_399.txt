<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation (to remember boundaries) is clear and rooted in her sensory perception. Her half-mask embodies an internal contradiction between seeing too much and trusting peripheral awareness. The final endurance (Earned Stasis) is credible, though the interior conflict is more stated than dramatized in simultaneous impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) crystallizing Mira's enduring duty. The cost—solitary, cyclical labor—is legible in the final walk. Structure is a single, coherent reflective scene; orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable. The dunes, pavilion, and kinetic parapet are not just vivid but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through Mira's POV, and woven into action ("pressed her palm against the kinetic parapet").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a deepening of Mira's resolve and the stakes of preservation. The dominant stake (maintaining wisdom echoes) tightens through her reflective realization. Cost is felt in her isolated, perpetual tending. Agency (her decision to continue) drives the closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (memory, boundaries, echo) emerges organically from concrete images and actions. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the child who will one day hear the echo. Avoids moralizing; some abstractions ("felt recognition") lightly dilute.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable, first-person-close third. Distinct perceptual signature (half-mask, peripheral awareness) controls the narrative filter. Lyric, patterned prose is consistent and legible, teaching its rhythm early. No dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and highly controlled. Information density is high; sentences advance atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Rhythm varies purposefully. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. A hairline risk of overwriting is managed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of desert mysticism, kinetic boundaries, and epistemological preservation. The half-mask, kinetic parapet, and conjured clearings feel organic and specific. The quiet, accumulative structure is a bold risk that heightens stakes and coheres.</comment>
