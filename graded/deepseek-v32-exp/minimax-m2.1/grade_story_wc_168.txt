<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictions like grief and purpose acting simultaneously. Her final choice to transform pain into light is earned by prior causality and scars, with visible cost in the loss of Elena and her innocence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in "traded her innocence." Orientation is clear early, and the porcelain box persistently shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through Mira's POV, with the ridge path and porcelain box charging the closure. Sensory details like "puckered skin" and "moonlight" are selective and purposeful, mirroring internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating pain into purpose) escalates through Mira's reflective agency under the accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable in her scars and the bargain, tightening to a decisive choice to enlighten others.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images like the box and scars, with subtext in gestures. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through "transform her burning into someone else's light," avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature tied to Mira's profession and trauma. Rhythm and diction control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of survival tropes through specific details like the porcelain box and bargained innocence. Risk-taking in lyrical reflection heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
