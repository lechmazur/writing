<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cassian's motivation is clear and rooted in a lifetime of covenant work, with concrete interiority (the weight of the stone, memory of his master). However, under the pressure of the climactic tethering, his emotional state remains a dedicated wonder without significant internal contradiction or a hierarchy of conflicting values, which limits the score. The final choice is earned by prior causality but the cost is more conceptual than personally felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, building density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation is immediate and clear. Closure lands on the page with undeniable cost ("the light was not fully reclaimed—perhaps it never could be") and is shaped by the persistent constraint of the chamber's honesty rule, making the final image of the born song deeply earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The resonance chamber is not just vivid atmosphere; it actively constrains choice through its "wilts near dishonesty" rule, forcing Cassian's narrated work. This micro-setting and its objects (orchestrion, chip, tools) are indispensable, directly charging the final image where "a song had remembered how to be born." Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through the POV's professional lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive cadence shift from meticulous preparation to the act of tethering. The dominant stake (reclaiming light/song) is signaled early and tightens through Cassian's agency. The cost—partial, uncertain success—is legible on the page and reweights the final moment, though the price is more thematic than viscerally personal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (patience, restoration, memory against loss) emerges organically from concrete particulars—the covenant, the chip, the act of mending songs. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing: "every melody mended was a tether between what darkness had taken and what patience could restore." Subtext is rich in the central concept and imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable, close third-person POV with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, precise, attuned to sound, fragility, and memory. Diction and syntax reflect the character's worldview and the story's tone. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled. The voice modulates effectively under the pressure of the climax, maintaining clarity and rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and impeccably controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variety. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences accelerate and breathe with the scene's needs. The opening line anchors the tone, and the final line resonates with charged reconfiguration. Minor abstraction in the first phrase is forgivable given the immediate concrete anchoring.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a music-box repairman, a covenant of rust, a stolen light, and the mending of intangible songs is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is transformed through grounded, lived detail and a coherent aesthetic vision. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
