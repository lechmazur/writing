<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to the ridge and the seed's awakening, but interior contradiction is understated; her competence and resolve are evident, yet the final renunciation (trust over verification) is earned by the on-page dream and carries cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Mira realizes knowledge "could not be verified, only trusted," reweighting the premise with felt cost (monsoon's arrival). Causal lens holds from monsoon deadline to ridge journey; orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressure‑bearing: the ridge and bloom‑flower constrain the awakening choice; sensory details (wild thyme, luminous scent) are filtered through Mira's profession and urgency, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultural memory) tightens under the monsoon deadline; Mira’s agency drives the climb and awakening, and the cost (dream‑ways washed clean) is legible on the page, though the escalation is more accumulative than causal‑tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the seed’s awakening and Mira’s realization; the ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer (trust over verification, memory scattered like seeds) without moralizing, supported by concrete images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third‑person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, precise perceptual signature that mirrors Mira’s role; prose rhythm modulates with pressure, and any elision (e.g., the dream’s transmission) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and polished, with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle—even in peak beats like the dream sequence—and closure image is clear and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of reality‑checking, memory‑preservation, and monsoon‑driven urgency feels fresh and inevitable; specific, grounded choices (knowledge fruit, bloom‑flower) transform familiar tropes, and risk in lyrical density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
