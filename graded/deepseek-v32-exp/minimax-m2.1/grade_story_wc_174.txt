<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's characterization is profound with embodied contradiction; his micro-choice to reverse-tell stems from motivated internal conflict, and his epiphany is earned with visible cost in the story stick's vibration and his renunciation of narrative conquest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant conceptual repricing with felt cost; the accumulative/textural lens holds tightly, orientation is immediate, and the dome's acoustics and story stick's return charge the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and charges the closure; the dome and meteor hush create a cohesive atmosphere that mirrors Elias's internal shift and constrains the scene's acoustic logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through Elias's agency in reverse-telling; cost is legible in his realized complicity and the story stick's recognition, tightening ethical pressure under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer on ethical storytelling without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the image of unwritten words.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is lyrical with a distinct perceptual signature; elision is purposeful, and rhythmic control under pressure heightens the epiphany without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is meticulously crafted with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or figurative muddle, and sentences propel the accumulative texture toward closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of storytelling ethics and reverse narrative; the concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in structure that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
