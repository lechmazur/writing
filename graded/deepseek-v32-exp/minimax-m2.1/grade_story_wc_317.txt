<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion (laughing in the empty darkness) and micro-choices under pressure (planting the seed, shifting her designs). Her motivation—to safeguard innovation—intensifies credibly against commercial pressures, and her final realization is earned by prior causality with visible cost. No second character on page, so relationship bullets are N/A.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details and reflections build to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure, with cost legible in the final image of "potential... heavy with the hush." Orientation is clear within 120 words; causality is intact, with the seed's arrival driving Mira's introspection and design evolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly selective and purposeful—the brook, moonlight, terracotta pot—and functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (planting near water for moisture) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through Mira's POV, and spatial choreography remains coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safeguarding innovation) escalates under the Accumulative lens through Mira's reflective deepening. Agency is clear: her decision to embrace "radical patience" forecloses the path of predictability with a felt cost. One meaningful tightening suffices, driven by her interaction with the seed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (patience, unsolvable mysteries) emerges organically from concrete events and images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer at closure. No moralizing; subtext operates through implication (the seed as teacher). The final reconfiguration reweights prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "moonlight fracture across the water"). Voice is consistent, poetic yet precise, reflecting Mira's mindset. No dialogue; elision and compression are purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere seamlessly. The final paragraph lands with clarity and resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of escape-room designer and corpse flower seed feels inevitable and fresh. Risk-taking in a quiet, reflective plot heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise is transformed through specific lived detail and a non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>
