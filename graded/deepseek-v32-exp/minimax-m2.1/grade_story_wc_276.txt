<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Morwen's cool-headed patience is consistently shown through concrete micro-choices (approaching the garden with "a loose grip," learning silence has weight). His final act of "voicing silence" arises from his established mastery of stillness, earning the closure change. The cost is felt in the luminous spike and his new purpose as a vessel, though interior contradiction is subtle rather than stark.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the echo finds home, the constellations settle, and Morwen is changed. Cost is legible in the final image: "a cool-headed fisher ... now carrying the final song of a god." Orientation is immediate; pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is indispensable—it pressures choices (silence becomes a tactic), charges the final image, and is rendered with vivid, selective sensory detail ("crystalline spires that hummed with visible vibrations"). Environment constrains and enables the entire arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (catching the echo) escalates through Morwen's agency under the accumulative lens: his zigzag movement and ultimate voicing of silence are active choices that tighten options. Cost is visible in the spike's transformation and his new burden, foreclosing his former life.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence as vessel emerges organically through image and action, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer—the echo housed in iron and memory. No moralizing; subtext is rich (the spike "transliterates" emotion). The final image reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with a distinct lyrical texture that mirrors Morwen's perceptual signature. Prose rhythm and diction are controlled under pressure ("a lullaby sung by wild things who had forgotten why they sang"). No head-hopping; purposeful elision (the garden's whispers) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and propulsive without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("silence had weight"). Information density is high; sentence rhythm varies naturally. No artifacts that obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar elements (fisher, mystical garden, dying goddess) through specific, grounded choices. The concept of "voicing silence" feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative, lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional specificity avoids template.</comment>
