<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eleanor's characterization is concrete and particular, with her observant nature and principled conflict dramatized through micro-choices. The final decision to intervene is earned by the proof-by-contradiction realization, showing a credible endurance of her values with the cost of breaking the family cycle legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds cleanly from accusation to reasoning to resolve. Closure is a Charged Poise—her descent with the pen as a divining rod—that reconfigures options with the undeniable cost of confronting her legacy. Orientation is immediate; no plot amnesia.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The observatory functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice (isolation enables reflection) and charges the final image (the city as an unfinished story). Sensory details (cedar, polish, drifting clouds) are filtered through Eleanor's POV and serve atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (integrity vs. complicit legacy) escalates through her logical deduction, a tightening driven by protagonist agency. The cost of breaking the "orbits of regret" is felt in her resolve to intervene, narrowing options toward a concrete investigation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of breaking generational silence emerges through particulars (pen nib, archived gaps, orbits metaphor) without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the city-as-story image, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—observant, analytical, metaphorically rich. Voice modulates under pressure (e.g., "solemn and sharp as a paper cut") without register drift. No dialogue, but interiority is precisely filtered.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with figurative language ("gray whales migrating through fog") serving atmosphere and character. No loops, scaffold, or artifact muddle; sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with reflective beats and decisive turns.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of logical proof-by-contradiction within a literary family-saga context. The heiress trope is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character (observant cataloguer) and stakes (breaking cycles), with risk-taking in reflective density.</comment>
