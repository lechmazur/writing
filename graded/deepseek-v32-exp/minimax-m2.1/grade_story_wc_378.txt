<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cara's characterization is richly contradictory (android/organic, machine/feeling) and her final choice to miniaturize chaos is earned by prior causality with visible cost—the emptying of the box and her fragmented wholeness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost on the page: "her box now empty, her fear contained and miniaturized." Orientation is immediate, and the magnetic shift constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The dome, roses, and magnetic storm are not just backdrop but pressure choices and charge the final image. The glass dome's hum, the roses' curling petals, and the alcove all constrain action and mirror internal states with precise sensory selection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save roses/resolve static) escalates through Cara's agency under the accumulative lens; the controlled burn decision narrows options and carries a legible cost—her fragmentation—that reweights the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of containment, fragmentation, and wholeness emerges through concrete particulars (the box, the roses, the static) and resolves in a resonant, non-literal final image without moralizing, inviting complex reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature ("magnetic north wandering somewhere past Saturn's memory"). Voice modulates with pressure, and purposeful compression (e.g., "fragmented wholeness") is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density and no loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful; rhythm varies naturally, and peak beats remain clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of android caretaker, magnetic apocalypse, and box of childhood fears feels organic and inevitable; risk-taking in poetic abstraction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the concept is fully committed to.</comment>
