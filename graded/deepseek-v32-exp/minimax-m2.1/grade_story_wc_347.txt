<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's reluctant caretaker role is embodied through concrete micro-choices and contradictory impulses ("her reluctant heart stirred against her will"). Her final decisive action is earned by prior causality (blueprint discovery, understanding the seed). The cost of inherited duty is felt, avoiding diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens is clear and held. Orientation is anchored within the first paragraph. Closure is a decisive change (path opens) with a resonant reconfiguration of her acceptance; cost is legible in the "transfer of weight" and the night-frost deadline. Setup (seed, blueprint, travelers) pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choice—the labyrinth's pattern demands her navigation, the cliff and frost constrain time. The nut and blueprint act as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her expertise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide travelers before frost) escalates under causal pressure via the tightening clock and the mechanical birds' cries. Mira's agency drives the escalation—she uses the blueprint and seed to actively solve the problem. Cost is visible in the inherited burden and the risk of failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of inherited duty and graceless beauty emerges through particulars (the orchard as a wound, the heartseed as a key). Subtext operates in image and action; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the opening path and her stirred heart. No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that notices "offhandedly exact" geography and bird-cry patterns. Voice is consistent, lyrical yet precise. Diction remains within her lexicon, and psychic distance shifts intentionally with emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of scaffold or loops. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful ("like a wound that refused to heal"). Sentence-level propulsion varies with scene needs, accelerating at the climax. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cursed orchard, mechanical birds, and labyrinth mathematics feels fresh and inevitable. The heartseed-as-key and blueprint concepts are fully integrated through character action. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
