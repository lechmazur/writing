<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's gravity-defying curse and desire for integration are concretely embodied; her final choice to become the one who drops the ripple is earned by the painful journey through fractures, with visible cost in the darkening brightness and acceptance of fragmentation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mira accepts control; the accumulative lens holds, building through imagery and memory shards; cost is legible in the "shadowed corridors" and the final image of the ripple she will now direct.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The viaduct and clay tablet are indispensable, constraining choice (the bridge as path) and charging the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's perception, with the glowing stones and darkening brightness mirroring internal depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (conquering the labyrinth of self) escalate accumulatively as Mira delves deeper; her agency drives the tightening—she chooses to touch the next fracture and embrace being the ripple-dropper—with cost felt in the fragmentation and earned integration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of integration emerges through concrete images (fractures, labyrinth, ripple) without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer as Mira reconceptualizes control, reweighting prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, reflective voice that modulates rhythmically under pressure; perceptual signature is consistent (noticing shifts in runes, darkening brightness), and any elision (procedural generation) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and rhythmic control; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; each sentence advances story or atmosphere, and the final image lands with clarity and charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fractured timelines, procedural generation, and psychological labyrinth feels organic and inevitable; risk-taking in abstract concept is fully committed, with specificity (clay tablet, viaduct) anchoring the fresh angle on self-integration.</comment>
