<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mirabel's characterization is concrete and her motivation clear, with interior contradiction (fear vs. desire to understand) acting in scene. The final acceptance is earned by the flower's transformation and the memory revelation, with visible cost in the empty vial and her grief. However, the epiphany is slightly direct, though anchored in the specific experience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (the empty vial, the acceptance of grief) under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is immediate, and the pattern of light, scent, and memory builds coherently to the final reconfiguration. The persistent constraint of the ultraviolet light and the perfume vial shape the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the Conservatory, ultraviolet light, and the flower are essential to the revelation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mirabel's expertise. The greenhouse as a micro-setting charges the final image of the bloom as a lantern.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding grief) is signaled early and tightens through the flower's transformation, driven by Mirabel's agency (using the vial). The cost is legible in the empty vial and her acceptance. Under the Accumulative lens, the density of details reweights the stake with a meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (flower, vial, light) and culminates in a resonant, non-literal answer: grief as the shape of caring. Subtext operates through image and implication, avoiding moralizing. The final image reweights prior material without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature (poetic, scientifically precise) that reflects Mirabel's expertise. No head-hopping. The voice modulates with emotional intensity, and the elision (brother's journals) is paid off in the revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet controlled, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and the final image is clear and resonant. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of memory, grief, and extinction through a fresh, specific lens (lantern broker, ultraviolet light, molecular memories). The premise is fully committed to, and the final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
