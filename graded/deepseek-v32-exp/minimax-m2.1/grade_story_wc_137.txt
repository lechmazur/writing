<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's sympathetic skepticism is concretely embodied; interior contradiction between doubt and wonder drives micro-choices; final stance—skepticism with a companion in wonder—earned through transcription and memory immersion with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orientation immediate; accumulative lens holds as transcription deepens into memory revelation; closure lands with Charged Poise—palm on tile, memories flowing—cost legible in "taking and giving in equal measure."</comment>
