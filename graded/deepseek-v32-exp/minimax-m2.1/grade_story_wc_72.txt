<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Thalassor's transformation from static guardian to nuanced witness is earned through cascading revelations and concrete interiority. His motivation evolves credibly, and the final renunciation of certainty carries cost. The arc is clear, though the emotional cost could be more viscerally embodied to reach the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; the ampoule's arrival triggers a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page with clear cost—the loss of rigid purpose—and the final image of the faded ampoule reweights the premise. Orientation is immediate, and causality remains intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underwater garden is essential, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "foxglove-purple stains"), woven through action. The environment actively teaches Thalassor, mirroring his internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes center on identity; escalation occurs through accumulating revelations that tighten Thalassor's understanding. His agency in projecting to the diver and shifting his role demonstrates a meaningful deepening. Cost is legible but quiet, fitting the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the foxglove's duality and the garden's contradictions. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—embracing questions over answers—without moralizing. Subtext operates through image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct lyrical voice that reflects the statue's ancient consciousness. Telepathy is handled cleanly; perceptual signature is consistent. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful ("cascading waves," "unraveled like a thread"). Sentence variety supports momentum; information density is high without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of a statue gaining consciousness through accumulated souls is fresh and synthesized with the foxglove ampoule's duality. The quiet, philosophical arc takes risks that heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
