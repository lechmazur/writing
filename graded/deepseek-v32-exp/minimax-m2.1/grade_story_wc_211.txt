<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in occupation, with embodied emotion and a clear micro-choice (immersing in the wax). However, contradictory impulses are not present in scene, and the epiphany, while earned, lacks visible cost on the page beyond the final "velvet disquiet."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens held perfectly; orientation clear within 120 words. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (silence redefined as filled) with legible cost in the final image ("velvet disquiet"). The prophecy payoff is tightly integrated and transforms prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice (rooftop garden as retreat, wax cylinder as tool). Sensory details (salt wind, city lights) are filtered through POV and charge the final image. The orchard and tower are indispensable to the atmosphere and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (meaning in silence) escalates through Seraphine's active immersion; the turn is a deepening of knowledge that reweights the silence with cost. Agency drives the escalation under the accumulative lens, and the final disquiet is a felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and promises emerges organically from concrete details (foghorn, recording, dead languages). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the dead keeping their word, without moralizing. Subtext is rich in implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptually specific voice. The prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity (e.g., "amber light through a window left ajar"). No head-hopping; elision (the recording's content) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and polished, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("velvet disquiet"). Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with the accumulative build. No artifacts muddy closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of foghorn silence, oath scribe, and dead-language prophecy feels fresh and inevitable. The angle on silence as a vessel for ancestral promises is non-obvious, and the emotional specificity avoids cliché. Risk-taking in lyric mode coheres.</comment>
