<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Miriam's interior contradiction (rational scientist vs. symphonic griever) is embodied in concrete micro-choices; her final reconfiguration is earned by the foam-pattern insight with visible cost ("a weight that has shifted").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (conceptual repricing) with felt cost ("grief loosen... becomes bearable") and the braided-stream image reweights separation/connection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The braided ravine and foam patterns constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Miriam's scientific perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Internal stake (atonement/guilt) escalates via accumulative density of reflection and observation; protagonist's agency in tracing foam drives the decisive insight with legible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges organically through chrysalis, foam, and braided streams; final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice distinctively blends polymer-chemistry precision with symphonic lyricism; POV is stable, perceptual signature strong ("she understood foam at a molecular level").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmically varied, and artifact-free; figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off at closure ("the braided ravine holds all its streams").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of polymer chemistry and grief; chrysalis and foam imagery transform familiar tropes through specific, inevitable character logic.</comment>
