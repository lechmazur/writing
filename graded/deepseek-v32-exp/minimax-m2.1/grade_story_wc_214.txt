<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The cosmic janitor’s spiritually curious nature is embodied through concrete, reverent actions, and the final handling of the star fragment reveals a clear hierarchy of values. However, the characterization lacks interior contradiction or a dynamic struggle; the POV is consistently serene and wise, missing the flawed, contradictory impulses that would elevate the score. The closure choice—gentle witnessing—feels inherent rather than earned under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building density through layered description toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands on the page with felt cost in the star's "naked exposure" and the janitor's understanding; the final image of the fragment awaiting rebirth reweights prior material. Orientation is clear early, and the taught pattern of observation-empathy-return holds coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral: the station's "hollow between celestial currents" and the yellow lantern glass are micro-settings that constrain action (tracing paths, handling fragments) and decisively charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the janitor's perceptual signature. The one limiting factor is a slight descriptive density that borders on static.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a deepening: the stake (finding strength in vulnerability) tightens through the janitor's act of tracing the star's path, which changes knowledge and crystallizes stance. Agency resides in attentive, reverent action, foreclosing indifference. Cost is legible in the star's "no longer having to burn" and the janitor's realization. The escalation is singular but sufficient and coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (strength in vulnerable openness) emerges organically from concrete actions and images—the tracing, the fragment's pulse, the recycling fires—avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the janitor's discovered "quiet fire." However, the thematic conclusion nears explicit articulation in the final paragraph, slightly reducing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, deeply filtered through the janitor's spiritually curious perception. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture with rhythmic control. No head-hopping. The voice maintains a consistent "primal elegance," though at peak intensity it risks a uniform elevated register that slightly mutes modulation under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush and generally precise, with strong information density. However, figurative language is pervasive ("flourishing stillness," "primal elegance"), creating a consistent but occasionally stacked ornamentation that slows momentum. Minor paraphrase loops ("vulnerability... honesty... connection... power") appear, and while not fatal, they introduce a scaffold-like quality in thematic beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The core premise—a cosmic janitor practicing empathetic archaeology of light—is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The perspective feels singular and memorably grounded in specific, lived detail. The story fully commits to its lyric, accumulative design, transforming a potentially whimsical concept into a vehicle for genuine emotional and thematic resonance.</comment>
