<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "stone in his chest"). Contradictory impulses act in scene, and his final choice to speak the truth is earned by prior causality with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Marcus becomes the "second cry wolf," with cost legible in his refusal to let impossibilities end. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, and orientation is anchored early. Persistent constraint of disbelieved prophecy shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice; the lighthouse prison and lattice charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through POV. Micro-setting (door scuffs, lattice) integrates into action and themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (inheriting story over silence) escalates through density increase under the Accumulative lens. Marcus's agency drives the tightening when he speaks aloud, with cost unmistakable in his transformation. No coincidence or resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—truth, silence, inheritance—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of sustaining impossibilities. Subtext operates in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical with a strong perceptual signature (e.g., "copperlight repose"). POV is stable and single; prose rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping. Purposeful compression and elision are taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clarity is maintained even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of the "cry wolf" legend through specific setting, objects, and tone. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Feels inevitable in hindsight with authentic vision.</comment>
