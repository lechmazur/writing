<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira’s exhaustion and painterly perception are concretely embodied, and her exchange of the brooch reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. However, internal contradiction is not deeply dramatized on the page, and the stranger remains functional rather than a full crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens held; closure is a resonant Earned Stasis (sleep) with clear cost (brooch given up, meaning found). Orientation is immediate, causality coherent, and the final image reconfigures her journey.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through Mira’s perception, constrains choice (causeway, island access), and charges the final image. The tidal island and rain trails are essential to the convergence and the exchange.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Mira’s search for meaning/clarity) escalates through the exchange, which narrows options and carries cost (brooch). Under the accumulative lens, the deepening is legible, though pressure remains quiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of threshing meaning from a broken world emerges through concrete particulars (brooch, telescope, convergence) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the exchange and sleep.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; voice is distinct, lyrical, and mirrors Mira’s exhaustion and painterly eye. Dialogue is spare but natural, and the perceptual signature (“colors she couldn’t name”) is consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of loops or artifacts. Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated. Sentence-level propulsion varies with Mira’s fatigue, and the final lines land with clarity and charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic setting is refreshed by specific focus on a painter’s perception, insomnia, and a convergence of water trails. The exchange and tone of “haggard awe” feel organic and inevitable, though not radically unprecedented.</comment>
