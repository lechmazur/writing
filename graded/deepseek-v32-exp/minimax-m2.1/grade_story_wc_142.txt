<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with interiority shown through orderly intuitive rhythm and embodied emotion (stone chip grounding her). However, the internal conflict of dual allegiance is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene, limiting depth under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise with legible cost—the weight of responsibility settling into her bones—under a coherent causal lens. The old language constraint shapes tactics, and orientation is clear early, but the closure leans slightly toward setup rather than a decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and pressures choices; the stone chip and graffiti method constrain action and charge the final image. Some decorative description ("gleamed like floating diamonds") slightly ornaments without harm to closure. Capped due to Q2 not reaching 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency: investors arrive, she responds with symbols, tightening stakes. Cost is visible in her absorbed responsibility. However, the conflict remains systemic rather than intensely personal, muting visceral pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through symbols and action, with a resonant non-literal answer in the final image of community as foundation. A slight direct statement ("built by people who chose to trust") nudges toward telling but does not moralize.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature that mirrors Mira's orderly intuition. No dialogue; prose rhythm controls pressure effectively. Capped due to Q2 not reaching 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high density and varied syntax; no loops or scaffold. Occasional figurative flourish ("canals carried both merchants and memories") risks ornament but does not muddle clarity. Capped due to Q2 not reaching 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The floating carnival city with secret resistance language offers a fresh, specific synthesis; the culture shock absorber perspective transforms familiar gentrification tropes. Risk-taking in world-building heightens stakes. Capped due to Q2 not reaching 9.0.</comment>
