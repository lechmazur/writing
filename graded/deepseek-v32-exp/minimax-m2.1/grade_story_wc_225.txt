<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and contradictory (guilt vs. belief in her lesson), and her final self-forgiveness is earned through the tactile, on-page decoding of the tapestry, with visible cost in the quieting of her mind. The fidgets productively trait is a specific micro-choice that enables the key action. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression is embodied and credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost ("her mind quiet in a way it had not been since the trial"). The accumulative lens holds, building through imagery to a decisive internal shift. Orientation is clear within 120 words; the single-scene structure with integrated backstory meets BRR limits and tilts present stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The frozen village and platinum labyrinth are not just atmospheric; they constrain choice (she avoids then approaches the labyrinth) and charge the final image as the village thaws. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's chess-tutor perception of patterns and calculations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) is signaled early and escalates through Mira's agency in decoding the tapestry, a meaningful deepening that reweights her past. Cost is legible on the page in her quieted mind and the villagers' movement. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tapestry's hidden message and the frozen village's thaw, offering a resonant, non-literal answer about the value of sacrifice over winning. No moralizing; subtext operates through image and implication, with the final "fierce repose" recharging prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature (chess-tutor pattern-noticing) and lyrical, rhythmic control. No dialogue; purposeful compression and elision are taught and paid off in the closure. Voice remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Information density is high (e.g., "the woven hush of its design" does multiple jobs). Sentence-level craft supports the accumulative build and closure charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of chess, frozen time, and tapestry decoding feels fresh and inevitable. The accumulative, lyric approach is a risk that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific, verifiable detail (platinum labyrinth, frayed threads) anchors the emotional arc.</comment>
