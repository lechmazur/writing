<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in family curse and linguistic mission; micro-choices (pressing diamond, descending, speaking) reveal hierarchy of values. Interiority is concrete though occasionally abstract ("texture of feeling"). Final choice—harnessing the liminal moment—is earned by prior causality with visible cost (curse lifting). Slight deduction for emotional embodiment that occasionally leans descriptive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; orientation is immediate and vivid. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (new language born from dying elements) with legible on-page cost (curse transforms). Single-scene structure tightens meaningfully toward tunnel climax; persistent constraint (curse/diamond) shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through Elara's perception. Setting (canyon, bone towers, tunnel) actively constrains choice and charges the final image—the tunnel of echoes is indispensable for the climax. Micro-setting (flawed diamond) functions as a tool that awakens to accumulated sound.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating texture before language dies) escalates under Accumulative lens via density increase and pattern break. Protagonist agency drives tightening (movement into tunnel, spoken words). Cost is legible as the curse lifts and transforms. One meaningful pressure point sufficiently deepens and reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of language death/translation emerges organically through concrete images and events; subtext operates in echoes, flight patterns, and the diamond's curse. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (new language born) that reweights prior material without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo or statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt; voice has distinct lyrical texture with perceptual signature (noticing through linguistic and sensory filters). Prose rhythm modulates with pressure. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (e.g., "syllable by vanishing syllable") is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional: high information density, varied syntax, and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and supports clarity. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sentences advance story and atmosphere seamlessly; final image lands with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of language death, cursed artifact, and avian semiotics feels fresh and inevitable. Specific details (copper veins, towers of bone) anchor universals. Lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Premise is fully committed and transformed through character-specific stakes.</comment>
