<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mira's resolve is clear and consistent; her refusal of the merchant and declaration "I cultivate the sparks" reveal a hierarchy of values. Interiority is conveyed through selective perception and micro-choices (checking the clock, hand on staff), though deeper contradictory impulses under pressure are not fully explored. The final endurance (Earned Stasis) is credible and thematically charged.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost—the weight of carrying hope as a "pause" in a broken world. Orientation is immediate, pattern taught early. The merchant's arrival and departure fold neatly into the thematic escalation without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purpose-driven—the glowing dune, ash-gray sand, bioluminescent moss—and directly charges the final image. The environment mirrors internal stakes (colonizing darkness) and constrains choice through its pervasive atmosphere, not just backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protecting cargo/cultivating hope) is signaled early and tightens through the merchant's offer and philosophical challenge. Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a deepening of thematic pressure rather than causal turns; Mira's agency in refusal and declaration makes cost legible as ongoing burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete images and dialogue—hope as a pause, cultivating sparks in unlit corners. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the dune mending "note by phosphorescent note," avoiding moralizing while reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, filtered through Mira's poetic perception. Voice is distinct and controlled, with rhythmic, image-laden prose that modulates with emotional intensity. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying subtext and advancing thematic stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and rhythmic variety. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously. The final line achieves a resonant, image-driven closure without artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic, quantum, and mythic elements feels organic and inevitable. The dreamless freight guard, divergent archive, and wave-function charm are transformed through specific, grounded details that heighten stakes without gimmickry. Closure image is both fresh and earned.</comment>
