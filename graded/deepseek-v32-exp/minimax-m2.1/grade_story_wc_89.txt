<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("afraid, and ready") acts in scene; final metamorphosis earned by prior causality with visible cost in unraveling human self. Embodied emotion via trembling fingers and scent memories avoids label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a Charged Poise with cost legible in "love... larger than death" and transformation by dawn. Orientation clear early, persistent constraint of metamorphosis price shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard and stones constrain choice (ritual circle) and charge final image as "witness"; sensory detail (silver light, spice scent) is selective and POV-filtered, weaving atmosphere into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens: ritual crushing and breathing deepen stakes, narrowing options with cost in "unraveling." Dominant stake (reforge bond) tightens through on-page choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of love transcending death emerges through particulars (phoenix, spices, fortune) without moralizing; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via becoming a "bridge" with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature ("heard love as a frequency older than sound"); rhythmic control under pressure, elevated diction matches voice and context, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density without loops or scaffold; figurative language ("moonlight pooling like water") is consistent and supports tone; sentence propulsion varies naturally with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of beast-whisperer lineage and grief metaphysics; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; transformation feels inevitable from established particulars.</comment>
