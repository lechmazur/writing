<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira is vividly drawn with clear motivation and embodied presence, but the single-minded focus lacks the contradictory impulses that would elevate to the highest band. The final patient stance is earned and costs are felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight; orientation immediate; closure is a charged poise with palpable cost—the waiting, the risk—and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival is rendered with sensory precision and actively constrains choices (piano bench, prize wall); it charges the final image of dormant life in a place of decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through Mira's agency; the decision to wait rather than plant immediately tightens pressure and carries a visible cost in risk and patience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges organically from concrete details (seeds, chains, carnival) and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Mira's lyrical, mission-focused perception; prose rhythm supports the tension and release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and precise, with high information density and no loops or artifacts; figurative language is controlled and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of seed vault, carnival, and post-regime survival feels fresh and specific; the quiet, strategic ending takes a bold risk that pays off.</comment>
