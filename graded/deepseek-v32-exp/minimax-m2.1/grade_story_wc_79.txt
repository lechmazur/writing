<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in loss, driving her to act against Council doctrine. Her interiority is concrete and embodied, though emotional states are occasionally summarized. The final choice to blow the whistle is a micro-choice that reveals her values and is earned by prior mapping and pattern-cracking. Contradictory impulses are present but not deeply explored in-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Orientation is clear within 120 words; the accumulative lens holds, building through sensory and pattern density to a Charged Poise closure. The glow of the spiral reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost—the risk of awakening or response. Causality is pattern-driven rather than strictly linear, fitting the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The city-on-turtles setting is vividly specific and pressures choice: the shell surface constrains Mira's action and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her cartographer's perception. The "sunwashed dread" tone permeates and reinforces the decay. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 <9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth about the expedition/watchers) is signaled early and tightens through Mira's agency—listening, then blowing the whistle. Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a cadence shift (the glow) that reweights options with implied cost. No explicit antagonist, but pressure coheres from environment and silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (memory, loss, seeking truth in decay) emerges through concrete particulars: patterns, whistle, watchers. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the glowing spiral, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in Council forbiddance and silent watchers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, precise voice that reflects Mira's cartographic perception. No dialogue; prose rhythm and diction are controlled under pressure. Perceptual signature is strong and consistent. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 <9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density; sentences vary rhythmically. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The opening and closing lines anchor and resolve effectively. Minor overwriting ("like something dying") is voice-consistent. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 <9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of city-on-turtles, pattern-language cartography, and silent watchers feels organic and inevitable. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 <9.0.</comment>
