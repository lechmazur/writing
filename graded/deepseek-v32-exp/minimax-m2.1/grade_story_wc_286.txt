<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's patient, phototropic nature is consistently embodied in her gentle handling of the lantern glass; her motivation to understand resistance to change drives the narrative, and her final decision to carry the oasis's memory is earned through prior sensory engagement and realization, with visible cost in her internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; orientation is immediate; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mira understands the oasis's stubborn gentleness and internalizes it, with cost legible in the final image of carrying "stubborn green inside her like a secret glaze."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral: the scorched wasteland and beekeeping oasis pressure Mira's quest, and the faded lantern glass functions as a micro-setting that constrains her choice and charges the final image, with sensory detail filtered through her POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, stakes escalate through density of perception—Mira's interaction with the thrumming glass deepens her understanding, and her agency in choosing to carry its memory forecloses other paths with a felt cost of enduring responsibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete images (clay memory, lantern thrum) without moralizing; the ending offers a non-literal answer where gentleness cuts through timelines, reweighting prior material through Mira's embodied realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature that modulates rhythmically under pressure; no head-hopping, and purposeful compression (e.g., "phototropic to kindness") is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats, and propulsion accelerates through cadence shifts to the resonant closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of potter, beekeeping oasis, fractured timelines, and phototropism feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the specific, irreplaceable elements cohere into a singular artistic stance.</comment>
