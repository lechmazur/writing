<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is concrete and intensifies to the final risk; interiority is embodied (promise "like a second heartbeat"). The final choice is earned, though the precognitive curse does not fully constrain the climax, a minor hairline slip.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost (all star dust used, promise shifts from weight to wing). Orientation is immediate, and the persistent frictionless world shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through Mira's perception; the tidal bluff, aurora, and painted rocks constrain choice and charge the final image. The frictionless world is consistently integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fulfilling the promise) escalates through Mira's agency: using all star dust in a new pattern. Cost is legible in the irreversible expenditure and the transformation of her vision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of connection vs. capture emerges through specific images and events; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("the borrowed dawn did not fade but spread") without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature; voice modulates with pressure ("ribbons of liquid mercury," "starlight and memory combined"). No head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmically varied, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is precise and supports closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific (frictionless world, eel herder, mathematical patterns); synthesis feels inevitable, and lyrical risk‑taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
