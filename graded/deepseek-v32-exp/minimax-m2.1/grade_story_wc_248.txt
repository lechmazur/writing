<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is clear, rooted in a principled defiance that evolves from destructive arson to dedicated preservation. Interiority is concrete and character-particular (e.g., touching book spines, feeling the tapestry's pull). The final choice to preserve is earned by her journey, with cost felt in her three-year commitment. A slight deduction for the repeated, slightly diagnostic label "analytically intuitive," which edges toward telling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis as preserver) with clear conceptual cost—the burden of safeguarding truth. Orientation is strong early. The tapestry-to-portrait-to-final-discovery linkage is coherent and taught. The cost is legible in the final paragraph's time investment and changed role.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Archive is not just backdrop; it actively constrains and enables discovery. The vandalized portrait is a micro-setting that charges the final image and directly enables the climactic choice. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through Mira's analytical curiosity ("burned-out lanterns that still held the scent of ancient smoke").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal mission to ancestral duty through Mira's agency. The dominant stake (rescuing/preserving truth) tightens meaningfully with the portrait discovery and the reveal of the lineage tapestry. Cost is visible in her three-year dedication. Coheres under the Accumulative lens as a deepening that reweights her purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the contrast between burning and preserving knowledge, avoiding direct statement. The final image of Mira carrying "a promise fulfilled" offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights her earlier arson. Subtext is strong in the portrait and tapestry as layered messages. No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is consistent third-person limited with a lyrical, precise texture. POV is stable, and the prose has a distinct perceptual signature ("volcanic tenderness"). No head-hopping. Some complex syntax is well-controlled and supports the accumulative, reflective pace.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and generally propulsive, but minor artifacts pull slightly. The phrase "analytically intuitive" is repeated, feeling like a label. The metaphor "volcanic tenderness" is striking but momentarily calls attention to itself. Otherwise, high information density and rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—library arsonist, lost archive, vandalized self-portrait, tapestry lineage—is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise offers a non-obvious angle on knowledge preservation. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
