<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's interiority is concrete and embodied; the shift from waiting to moving is earned by the pendant's arrival and her method of "interiorizing exteriors," with visible cost in the long vigil. The final choice is a resonant reconfiguration of her homesickness, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a charged poise (walking forward with transformed understanding) with felt cost (seventeen winters of waiting). Orientation is clear early; the pendant's arrival incites the decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Frozen garden in mist is integral, constraining choice and charging the final image as a threshold. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the guardian's perception, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal homesickness) tightens through the pendant's use and her act of interiorizing exteriors, leading to a reconfiguration of waiting into movement. Cost is legible in the transformation of her vigil.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of making friends with uncertainty emerges from concrete images and actions; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the guardian's walk into foggy lucidity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with a consistent perceptual signature and rhythmic control that modulates with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; purposeful compression supports the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density; no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, and sentence-level propulsion accelerates the closure beat without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar elements (feral guardian, magical pendant) through a specific lens of dimensional homesickness; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
