<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vividly dramatized through tactile micro-choices (thumb on dovetails, cloth pressed to palm); final decision to drive to Elko is earned by prior causality with visible cost—the relinquishment of emotional insulation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a Charged Poise (decision to confront history) with cost legible in "echo valley longing hadn't disappeared—it had simply learned to wait." Orientation anchored within first sentence, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (quarry trailer, speaker cloth) constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory detail is filtered through POV bias (appraiser's eye, roadie's memory) and integrates seamlessly with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose after loss) escalates via protagonist agency—the amplifier message forces a tightening; cost is unmistakable in the trade-off between factual insulation and confronting sound/silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through resonant images (cloth, amplifier, echo) without statement; ending offers a non‑literal answer—purpose survives in artifacts, sound finds new places to echo—that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third‑person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (lyrical, expertise‑filtered); rhythmic control under pressure, no head‑hopping, and purposeful elision (e.g., the funeral referenced but not detailed) pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language ("insulating emotionally with facts") is consistent and clarity‑driven; sentence‑level rhythm accelerates and breathes with emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of antiques appraisal and roadie memory feels inevitable; risk‑taking in internal, lyric focus heightens stakes without gimmickry; specific details (Ming vase, tube‑amp note) transform familiar tropes.</comment>
