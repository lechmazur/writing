<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is concrete and consistent; her silent defiance, embodied through dance and dice, drives all choices. The final liberation is earned by her endurance and coded preparations, with cost visible in her calm. Minor deduction for minimal on-page internal conflict; her struggle is more retrospective than simultaneous in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (water drains, she steps to freedom) with felt cost in her calm and the spiderweb image. The accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, building through patterns of dance, dice, and journal. Orientation is immediate and clear; the retrospective reveal of her rigging fits the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory is vividly specific and actively pressures the action (flooding, silence, rust). Sensory details are selective and purposeful (water buoys movement). Recurring objects (dice, spiderweb) charge the final image and constrain choice, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freedom/hiding the cure) tightens through her dance aligning the numbers, leading to the water draining. Escalation is driven by her agency (past rigging, present performance) under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the years of silence and her final calm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence as language and encryption as armor emerges organically from concrete particulars (dance, journal, dice). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—her voice lives in movement—that reweights all prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, rhythmic perceptual signature that filters the world through algorithms and patterns. The prose's purposeful compression (e.g., "pressure shapes rather than breaks") is taught and consistent, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythmic control, but contains a glaring text artifact: the untranslated Chinese characters and typo ("神经系统", "its方向盘") disrupt clarity and immediacy. This registers as a line-level coherence flaw, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis: a silent code breaker using dance and a coded journal in a sunken lab. Tropes of captivity and defiance are transformed through specific, grounded details (hangman's dice as a counting system, dance as algorithmic language).</comment>
