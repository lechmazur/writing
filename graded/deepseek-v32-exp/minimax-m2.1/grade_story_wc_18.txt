<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority in her work, but lacks contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure; final choice is observational rather than earned through visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with the mirror capturing the dream, cost legible in patience and precision; accumulative lens holds with smooth causality and clear orientation from the start.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and charges the final image; fog and ruined orchard act as micro-setting that erodes boundaries, integrated through sensory detail and POV filter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under accumulative lens, with stakes in capturing the dream; cost is implied in her night-long work, though not viscerally unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of erasing boundaries emerges through concrete images and the final mirror vision; subtext is rich, offering a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is clear in selective attention to fog, glass, and breath; no head-hopping or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is consistent and enhances closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mirror-making, dream-catching, and boundary-erasing feels inevitable; specific details transform tropes, and risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes.</comment>
