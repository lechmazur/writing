<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Characterization is concrete and motive is clear; the serene anger is embodied and drives micro-choices. The final choice to touch the ink is earned by prior obsession, though a slight explanatory note ("his unique perception of temporal dynamics") feels diagnostic. Closure cost is legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate; closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (tracker disappears into the mystery). The inferred drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, with pattern density building to the final image. Causality is consistent within the story's mystical logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective; the wind-carved encampment and the ink itself function as micro-settings that pressure choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through the tracker's perception, elevating the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (finding Vasquez, understanding time) escalate through the tracker's active investigation and culminate in his deliberate touch of the ink. Under the accumulative lens, density increases and cost is legible (his disappearance). Agency drives the tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from the interplay of time, perception, and mystery. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the tracker merges with the phenomenon—without moralizing. Subtext is rich in the ink patterns and the "consciously wild" intelligence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice that blends scientific precision and mystical perception. The prose reflects the tracker's consciousness; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is strong and consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density, but minor paraphrase loops (e.g., "ephemeral patterns in spilled ink," "serene anger" repeated) slightly dull momentum. No figurative muddle at closure; sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (albino tracker, disappearing ink, time perception) feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in the accumulative, lyrical structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The closure image transforms the premise with specificity.</comment>
