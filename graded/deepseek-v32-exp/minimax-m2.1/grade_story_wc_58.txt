<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's profession and internal conflict ("writing obituaries for the living") are concrete and drive the scene. Interiority is strong and embodied (touching the thread, the "reverence of farewells"). The final choice to stay is a credible Earned Stasis, motivated by her realization. Prevents a 9+ due to a slight drift into diagnostic label-speak at the opening ("become, in effect, a ghost") which abstracts a peak emotional state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is clear and held. Closure is a resonant Charged Poise: the traveler's realization she will become part of the "explained absences" reconfigures her purpose and the garden's meaning with palpable conceptual cost. Orientation is immediate, pattern of reflection is taught and paid off. The final image ("the first stroke of the map") provides decisive reweighting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is flawlessly integrated as both atmosphere and crucible. The garden and the weft thread are not just described; they actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The thread's tangible warmth and the garden's "geometry" filter through the POV's specific, professional perception, creating irreplaceable pressure and closure linkage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a deepening realization rather than a causal turn. The dominant stake (understanding absence/presence) tightens meaningfully via the thread and the late-ship context, culminating in the choice to stay. Cost is legible but somewhat conceptual; the visceral price of her own impending absence is felt more as implication than immediate trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of documented absence emerges organically from concrete particulars (thread, notebook, garden). Subtext is rich, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: healing is the act of mapping, and the traveler joins the map. The "explained absences" concept is fully integrated into character arc and final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable, intimate, and distinct. The voice has a precise, lyrical perceptual signature ("leaves fell like whispered confessions"). Sentence rhythm modulates beautifully with reflective density. No head-hopping; all elision (the ship, the conquest) is purposeful and taught, enriching the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor artifact: in the first paragraph, "become, in effect, a ghost" introduces a slight abstract label. A near-paraphrase loop occurs between "geography of healing" and "first stroke of the map," though it's thematically resonant. These do not obscure closure but prevent a 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core concept ("obituaries for the living") is fresh and fully committed to. The synthesis of traveler, thread, and garden feels inevitable and singular. The lyric, accumulative structure is a bold risk that heightens stakes and coheres, transforming a quiet moment into a profound conceptual reconfiguration.</comment>
