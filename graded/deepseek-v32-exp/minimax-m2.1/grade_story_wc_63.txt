<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Marcus's guilt and penance are embodied through precise actions and the rake handle inscriptions; his endurance is earned with visible cost, and contradictory impulses of seeking absolution versus accepting guilt act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure via Earned Stasis with cost legible in the 37-second pause and his exhale; orientation clear early, and persistent constraint of guilt shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Obsidian ridge and clock tower create atmospheric pressure; the pendulum and rake handle function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes of absolution escalate through textual density; the pendulum's pause forces a confrontation with guilt, driven by Marcus's agency, with unmistakable cost on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of incremental absolution emerges through ritual and image; final descent offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV with consistent perceptual signature; lyrical prose reflects Marcus's grief and precision, and rhythmic control under pressure is evident.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without artifacts; figurative language serves character and atmosphere, and information density is high with clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of guilt, time, and redemption through specific details like the rake handle; feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
