<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elira's interiority is concrete and her motivation as a translator compels her to act, with micro-choices under anesthesia revealing value hierarchy. The final renunciation (returning the cast) is earned by prior causality, but lacks contradictory impulses in scene, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the final image of shared "lotus-hearted ache." The brain coral fragment as persistent constraint charges the ending, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (atrium, twilight) is vividly filtered through Elira's perception, and the cast/coral fragment as micro-settings charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, mirroring internal states without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (witness through translation) escalates via Elira's agency in decrypting the cast, deepening into shared grief with a felt cost. Under accumulative lens, pressure tightens through density increase, but escalation is subtle rather than dramatic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of translation as witness emerges organically from particulars; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "lotus-hearted ache," reweighting prior trauma without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; lyrical, controlled prose reflects Elira's dreamlike state. No head-hopping; dialogue minimal but natural. Elision (anesthesia blur) is taught and pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("vernacular of shrapnel") integrates seamlessly, and sentence propulsion varies with emotional beats. Closure image is crystal clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of translator in recovery with child's trauma feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details (coral fragment, cast markings) avoid tropes through grounded emotional truth.</comment>
