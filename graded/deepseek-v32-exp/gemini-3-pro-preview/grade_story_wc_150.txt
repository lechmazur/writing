<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her diaspora experience, driving her choices. Her "warmly curious" trait is embodied in her tender interactions with the skeletons, constraining actions. The final decision to rebuild the sundial is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her week-long effort, foreclosing her dislocation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with the sundial casting a shadow, reconfiguring time and belonging with felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with pattern breaks in discoveries leading to the climax. Orientation is clear early, and the structure is tight for the length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "damp earth and ancient, sweet decay," constraining choices as roots dictate Elara's path.

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of healing dislocation escalates through discoveries of relics and the sundial, driven by Elara's agency.

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Themes of interrupted journeys and time emerge through concrete images like the shattered sundial, without moralizing.

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical prose like "breathing tomb." Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and elision is taught early. No head-hopping; internal coherence supports pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues.
