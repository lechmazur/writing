<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with interior contradiction between logic and intuition dramatized in her shift to wonder. The final choice is earned by prior causality, and the hidden sentimentality (ribbon) adds depth without diagnostic speak. Cost is felt in the bridging of divides.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (gemstone creation) and felt cost under a causal lens. Orientation is immediate, and the starlings' pattern provides a coherent trigger. The persistent constraint of her past reliance on logic shapes the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the orchard and waterfall constraining choice and charging the final image through the apple-scented breeze. Micro-setting (crystal table) integrates into action, avoiding postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transformation before celestial alignment) escalates under causal lens via time pressure and Elara's agency in observing starlings. Cost is legible in her foreclosed path of pure logic, driving one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of harmonizing logic and intuition emerges through particulars like the starlings' flight and the ribbon, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. No moralizing; subtext operates in image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (analytical mind yielding to wonder). Lyrical prose is voice-motivated and consistent, with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, but minor overwriting (e.g., "ancient freshness" paradox) slightly muddles peak beats without harming closure. No loops or scaffold; propulsion is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of alchemy and wonder feels inevitable, with specific details (frozen dew crystal, starlings) transforming tropes. Risk-taking in lyrical heightening stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure recharges prior material.</comment>
