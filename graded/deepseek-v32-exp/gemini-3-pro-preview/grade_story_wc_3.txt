<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and rooted in his traits as a translator; his analogical thinking drives key choices, and his emotional journey from mourning to action is embodied and earned, with cost felt in the final separation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Elian feels Aris's presence "forever just beyond reach"; causal lens holds strong with clear orientation, and the seed's persistence shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the magnetic arbor constraining choices like the decaying orbit; sensory details (ozone, old paper) charge the final image without clutter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elian's agency under causal lens; cost is legible in the emotional trade-off of recontextualizing Aris, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of translation as physics emerges organically from events; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the seed's growth, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; Elian's analogical thinking filters prose consistently, and elision (e.g., "physics of transition") is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold, and figurative language ("syntax flowed through metallic veins") enhances clarity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes language and physics uniquely; specific elements like the knowledge fruit seed feel inevitable, and risk-taking in metaphor heightens stakes.</comment>
