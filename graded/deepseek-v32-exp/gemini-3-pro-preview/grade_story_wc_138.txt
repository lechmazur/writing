<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and rooted in his immortal boredom, driving the plot with embodied emotion. His final choice to step into the void is earned by prior causality, though interior contradiction lacks depth. Micro-choices under pressure reveal his values, but the emotional progression is somewhat linear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot has strong causal linkages under a causal drive lens, with closure as a decisive change where cost is legible in Elian's physical unraveling. The spatial mutiny concept shapes tactics, and orientation is clear early. No teleporting props or outline-like sequencing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, with the prismatic escondite and solar storm actively pressuring Elian's actions. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elian's agency in using the storm and amulet, tightening options with clear cost in the dimension's destruction. Dominant stake (discovering the afterlife) is signaled early and deepens through his actions, though the climax relies slightly on external force.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, with a resonant, non-literal answer about reintegration into cosmic energy. Subtext operates through imagery and implication, avoiding moralizing. The final image reweights prior material without explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct poetic voice, and perceptual signature is consistent. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off. Dialogue is absent, so not evaluated, but prose reflects Elian's mindset under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no significant loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, though minor overwriting in peak beats doesn't harm closure. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing immortality and cosmic exploration with unique elements like spatial mutiny. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, and the closure feels inevitable. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
