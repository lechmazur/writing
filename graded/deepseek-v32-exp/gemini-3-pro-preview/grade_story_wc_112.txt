<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and internal conflict between his obliging facade and radical obsession. His final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in holding the secret against the cold.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Elian chooses earned stasis, foreclosing the path to travel sideways. The causal lens holds tightly, with the magnetic nexus as a persistent constraint shaping tactics. Orientation is clear early, and the plot progresses through because/therefore linkages.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with sensory details like "icy warmth" filtering through Elian's POV. The magnetic nexus and research station constrain choices and charge the final image, integral to the experiment's success.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes are dominant and escalate through Elian's agency, culminating in the lever pull and decision not to join the Weavers. Cost is legible on-page in the "warmth of the secret" against "biting cold," under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of sideways time emerges through events and images, with subtext in Elian's hidden truth. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through his secret.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic yet precise diction reflecting Elian's perception. No head-hopping; rhythmic control under pressure, such as in "subdued awakenings," enhances clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise and elegant, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful, e.g., "phantom fluttering," and peak beats remain clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, synthesizing sideways time and Void-Weavers with specific, grounded details. Risk-taking in concept and execution heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
