The lens holds without ambiguity, and his survivor constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices: the Winterglass Conservatory's cold pressures Elian's intervention, and the glass wall enables his conductive method. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through his POV via the heat-mapping visor, charging the final image of swirling heat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of saving the orchids is signaled early and escalates through Elian's agency under the causal lens. His decision to strike the rod and guide heat narrows options, with cost legible in the orchids' distress and his effort. The resolution is earned and forecloses the path of loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from silence, survival, and creating beauty, without moralizing. Subtext lies in Elian's trauma and repurposed tools.
