<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Silas's motivation to awaken empathy is clear and rooted in his prosopagnosia, driving methodical choices that culminate in the lancing action. His detachment contrasts with his goal, creating internal tension without stock phrasing. The final reaction from Miller is earned by Silas's crafted portrait, with cost visible in Miller's crumbled expression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages: Silas's precision leads to the portrait's creation, causing Miller's emotional shift. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (Miller's grief) and reconfigures the case from abstraction to lived tragedy. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and no plot amnesia or convenience undermines causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (limestone walls, mist) that pressures choices and charges the final image. The quarry functions as micro-setting, constraining Silas's work and mirroring the case's erosion. Tools like the stylus and ribbon are integrated into action, altering tactics and deepening atmosphere without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awakening empathy) escalates under causal lens through Silas's agency, culminating in the lancing action that narrows options and injects life into the portrait. Cost is legible in Miller's grief and the community's shifted perspective. No coincidence; pressure tightens via methodical steps to a decisive, earned turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of art's power to evoke empathy emerges through particulars like the ribbon's integration and the quarry's topography, avoiding moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures (Silas's focus, Miller's skepticism) and the final image reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity. Earned wisdom arises from concrete struggle, not platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Silas, with distinct perceptual signature (topographic maps, textures). Voice is controlled and rhythmic under pressure, with purposeful compression in climax. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or register drift; elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is precise and cohesive (e.g., "topographic maps," "lanced the center"). Sentences advance story and atmosphere; no artifacts obscure causality or closure. Read-aloud test passes with elegance and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes prosopagnosia and cold cases with originality, transforming tropes through specific details like the lancing action and ribbon integration. Emotional truth and risk-taking heighten stakes without gimmickry. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight, and the concept commits fully to its implications.</comment>
