<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot with professional curiosity. Her interiority is concrete, shown through actions like examining the floor and using the phrasebook. However, lacks contradictory impulses under pressure, preventing higher score. Micro-choices reveal values but no significant internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with the luminance materializing and dissolving, legible cost in its transience despite documentation. Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages from investigation to discovery. Orientation is clear early, and the dog-ear/hopscotch constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the airship and hopscotch board constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "violet bruise of twilight" and "cedar and old memories" are filtered through Elara's POV, integrating into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under causal lens, moving from observation to decoding with cost legible in the luminance's dissolution. Dominant stake of finding luminance is signaled early and tightens through her choices, though cost is moderate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of discovery and sociable isolation emerges through events and images, with ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the luminance revelation. Subtext in isolation connection avoids moralizing, and particulars like the hopscotch reweight prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping, and elision (e.g., dog-ear use) is taught and paid off. Rhythmic control under pressure supports clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language like "living smoke" is controlled and purposeful, and syntax varies naturally. Read-aloud rhythm is smooth, and closure image is undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in fresh synthesis of stranded luminance and hopscotch decoding, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific details, and risk-taking in conceptual integration heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
