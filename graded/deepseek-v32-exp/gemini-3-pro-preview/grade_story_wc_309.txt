<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in rejection of automation and pursuit of the sacred. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like trembling when unstrapping the pack, and micro-choices under pressure reveal her values. The final choice to place the keystone is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in shedding the regulatory pack.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly; closure is a decisive change with cost legible when the pack slides away and the arch restores. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the keystone placement sighs, reconfiguring the stakes. The ending makes the cost of human magic undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The icebound spire constrains choices, necessitating mist walking and charging the final image with the arch's restoration. Sensory details like "brilliant dimness" are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's POV. The setting pressures tactics and integrates seamlessly with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of human vs. automated magic escalates through Elara's agency, notably unstrapping the pack, which narrows options and raises cost. The climax is earned by her actions, with cost legible in the Looms stuttering and her shivering. Pressure coheres under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, not statement; the final image of "only a flawed hand could touch the divine" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates in silence and implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet consistent, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, such as in mist walking mechanics, and paid off at closure. Prose reflects Elara's mindset under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "the wind... bit" is purposeful and clear. Sentences advance story and atmosphere efficiently, and closure is undulled by any craft issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy and anti-automation themes, with tropes transformed through specific choices like the keystone's lingering luminance. Risk-taking in style and premise heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The ending feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
