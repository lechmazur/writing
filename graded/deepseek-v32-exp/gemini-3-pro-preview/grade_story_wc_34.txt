<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and rooted in his past with Kaelen, driving his actions with embodied emotion. His interiority is concrete, such as dreaming of melodies while sensing electromagnetic hum, and his final choice to use the relic is earned with visible cost. However, contradictory impulses are not deeply explored in scene, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with Kaelen's distress resolved and a calm after the thunder, under a causal lens. The cost is legible in Elian's effort and the emotional release. Orientation is clear early, and causality holds from preparation to lightning strike.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the misty courtyard and storm pressuring choices like the lightning timeframe. Sensory details like wet stone and ozone scent are integrated into action. The environment constrains the climax and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start: freeing Kaelen from digital purgatory. Escalation under the causal lens is driven by the approaching storm, forcing Elian to work faster. Agency is strong in the encoding and relic use, with cost felt in the emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of bridging physical and digital worlds emerges through objects and actions, like the flower press relic. Subtext is rich in implication, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, it leans slightly on symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with poetic phrases like "driftingly alert" and "tinkersong wonder" reflecting Elian's perception. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in the closure. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and concise, with high information density and varied rhythm. No significant loops or scaffold; figurative language like "the sky bruised" enhances atmosphere without muddle. Minor overwriting in descriptions prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality is high with a fresh synthesis of balladeer, digital ghost, and graffiti encoding. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in the premise heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details like the flower press add irreplaceability.</comment>
