<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and drives the plot, with consistent traits and micro-choices under pressure. However, interiority lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and emotional embodiment is strong but not deeply conflicted, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change in knowledge and resonant reconfiguration, as Elian understands the tragedy and the silo relaxes; cost is legible in the final image. The causal lens holds tightly, with orientation anchored early and persistent constraints shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the slanted room and silo atmosphere, charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, integrated through POV bias without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elian's agency in probing the diaries, leading to a tightening of knowledge and felt cost in the revelation. Under the causal lens, pressure coheres and narrows options, though the escalation is more deepening than dramatic reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the tapestry representing lost dreams, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the conceptual repricing of the axis shift and dream loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature reflected in poetic prose and rhythmic control. No head-hopping; voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision is purposeful, teaching the pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and vivid imagery without loops or scaffold. Sentence-level propulsion and varied rhythm support the atmosphere, and no figurative muddle obscures peak beats or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is original and ingeniously synthesized, with specific details like collecting wall stories and the displaced axis transforming familiar tropes. Risk-taking in structure and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
