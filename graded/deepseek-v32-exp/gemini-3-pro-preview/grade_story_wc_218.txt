<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his calm acceptance of death and desire to resolve the temple's conflict. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion like "burning ache in his lungs," and micro-choices under pressure show his systematic approach. The final renunciation (death) is earned by prior causality, though slight lack of internal contradiction limits the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change and felt cost as Silas's heart rhythm matches the stone's pulse. Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages from diagnosis to action to synthesis. Orientation is anchored early, and the persistent constraint of time shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, e.g., the "living stone pillars" and "copper wire" alter tactics. Sensory details like "ozone and wet earth" are purposeful, and the environment charges the final image of symbiotic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (interspecies respect) is signaled early and escalates under causal lens via Silas's agency and time pressure. Cost is legible in his deteriorating health and death, foreclosing paths with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of symbiosis emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in the copper wire as a bridge. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the stone-tree partnership, though occasional explicit phrasing slightly limits depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "piezoelectric hum," and lyrical rhythm under pressure. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent and purposefully compressed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, e.g., "Weeks bled into months." No loops or scaffold; figurative language is controlled, though minor purple hues in peaks prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ecological fantasy feels inevitable, with specific details like copper induction loops. Risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the premise is transformed through grounded choices.</comment>
