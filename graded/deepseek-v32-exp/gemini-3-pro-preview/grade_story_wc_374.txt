<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elara's skepticism is consistently portrayed through concrete interiority and micro-choices; her motivation drives the narrative, and the final change is earned with visible cost as she becomes a weather-carrier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is achieved with a decisive change as Elara is elected; the hybrid drive lens holds, and cost is legible in the cloud forming above her hands, with orientation clear early.</comment>
