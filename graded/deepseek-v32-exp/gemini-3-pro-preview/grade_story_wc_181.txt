<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions like teeth-aching anxiety and trembling fingers. His final choice to carve the fear is earned by prior causality, showcasing contradictory impulses and a visible cost. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Elian decides to carve the fear, closing the temporal loop with felt cost (lineage unzipping). Causal lens holds strong, with clear orientation early and a coherent structure. The ending reconfigures options under the inferred drive lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the astral orchard constraining choices and charging the final image as a "library of unlived lives." Sensory details like humming C-sharp fruit and glowing boughs are selective and POV-filtered, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ensuring lineage) is signaled early and escalates through Elian's agency, culminating in a decision that forecloses options with visible cost. Under the causal lens, pressure tightens meaningfully via his inquiry and realization, driving the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of temporal paradox and fear emerges through events and images, not direct statement, with subtext in the orchard as library. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer by carving "brightened disquiet," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, using poetic yet controlled language that reflects Elian's stress. Voice remains coherent under pressure, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping, enhancing rhythm and clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops or scaffold issues; figurative language like "weeping light" is purposeful and legible. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of temporal loops and cosmic curation, transformed through specific details like the pistachio shell. Turns feel earned in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry, supporting coherence.</comment>
