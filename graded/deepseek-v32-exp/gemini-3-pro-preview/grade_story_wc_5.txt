<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and sorrowful, driving the ritual with consistent traits; his physical patience is embodied, and the final choice to seal the map feels earned, though internal conflict is minimal for this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as the captured heartbeat hums in the plate, under an accumulative/textural lens; orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the frozen setting shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, constraining choices like kneeling in snow and using discarded items; the withered orchard charges the final image of the sealed map.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Silas's agency in the ritual steps, with cost legible in the use of safekept starlight and physical endurance; under accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transience and preservation emerges organically from images like the dead orchard and fused starlight; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic perceptual signature; voice remains consistent under pressure, and any elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful, and peak beats like the flash remain clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes flash-paper alchemy and safekept starlight with specificity; risk-taking in lyric approach heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
