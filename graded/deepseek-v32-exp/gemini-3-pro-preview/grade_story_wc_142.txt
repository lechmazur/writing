<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's dual allegiance is concretely embodied through micro-choices like spraying graffiti with a frantic heart, and her final act of placing the stone is earned by prior causality. Interiority remains specific and contradictory under pressure, avoiding stock phrasing. The resolution forecloses a path with visible cost, scaling to the length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the stone placement, reconfiguring the city's legal status under a causal lens that holds throughout. Orientation is anchored early, and the cost is legible in the dawn confrontation. The structure is tight, with no causality breaks, and the ending charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The raft city setting pressures choices through its fluid dynamics and constrains the climax via the foundation stone. Sensory details like "neon lights" and "grinding metal" are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's POV. The environment actively shapes tactics and charges the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake against privatization escalates through Elara's agency, driven by her graffiti-encoded commands that narrow options. Cost is felt in the "hopeful desperation" and the risk of legal seizure. The tightening is coherent under the causal lens, with no coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resistance to gentrification emerges through particulars like the graffiti code and stone placement, without moralizing. Subtext operates in the encoded messages and the final "baffling formation." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, evident in Elara's "orderly intuitive" perception of the city. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and purposeful compression (e.g., the graffiti mechanics) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "urban ballet with aerosol fumes" is purposeful and clear. Sentence-level propulsion matches scene urgency, and no artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of floating city, encoded graffiti, and legal loopholes feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the premise heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth anchors the concept, and the closure reconfigures familiar tropes through specific detail.</comment>
