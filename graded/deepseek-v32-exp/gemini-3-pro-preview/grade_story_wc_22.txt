<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and obsessive, driving the narrative; micro-choices like waiting for the bird's cadence reveal his values. However, limited internal contradiction slightly reduces depth, though his focused agency supports the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in the bioluminescent growth, reconfiguring the battlefield under an accumulative/textural lens; orientation is clear early, and causality holds from seed-casting to renewal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (e.g., "phosphorescent buds") pressure choices; the jetty and ocean function as micro-settings that constrain Silas's actions and charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (reclaiming the battlefield) escalate through Silas's agency in casting seeds, with cost legible in the garden's growth; under accumulative lens, density increase reweights the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation emerges through images and actions, not statement; the final garden growth offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; poetic diction and rhythm control heighten pressure, and elision (e.g., bird calls) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops; figurative language is purposeful, though minor abstraction in "narrow vastness" slightly limits peak clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic renewal with magical realism; specific details (e.g., dead languages) transform tropes, and risk-taking in style coheres without gimmickry.</comment>
