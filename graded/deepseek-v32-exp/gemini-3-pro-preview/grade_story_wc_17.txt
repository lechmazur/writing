<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied perception (e.g., "empathy that extended to inanimate stone"). His final choice to carry the burden is earned by prior causality, and micro-choices under pressure reveal his values. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with because/therefore linkages, leading to a closure that reconfigures meaning (Conceptual Repricing) as Elias understands the "resonance of betrayal." Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible in the crushing reality he feels. Lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details (e.g., "thick carpet of moss," "smelled of rain and rot") filtered through POV. The library and hearth constrain choices and charge the final image, as the environment directly shapes the discovery and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elias's agency under the causal lens, moving from professional mapping to moral burden. The cost is unmistakable when he feels the "crushing reality" and becomes the "sole keeper." One meaningful tightening forecloses options with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of legacy's burden emerges through particulars like the diaries and film negatives, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "screaming" walls, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Elias's empathy (e.g., "hear the sorrow in a cracked lintel"). Voice remains consistent under pressure, and any elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful (e.g., "dark throat of the building"), and syntax accelerates with scene needs without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept of a corridor echo cartographer with empathy for walls is fresh and specific, transforming tropes through grounded details. Synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking in voice and premise heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
