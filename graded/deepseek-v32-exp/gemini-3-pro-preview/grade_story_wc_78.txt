<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to turn obstacles into instruments is clear and consistently drives her actions; her interiority is concrete through embodied perception and micro-choices under pressure, such as visualizing the storm's geometry and striking the trunk with precision. The final act of naming the storm ("The Overture of the Apple Moon") is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her heaving chest and the lingering vibrations. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws are balanced with competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal drive lens with clear because/therefore linkages: Elara's interpretation of the storm leads to her proactive use of sketched resonance, resulting in the transformation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the storm harmonizes, reconfiguring options with felt cost in the "fading hum" and washed salt. Orientation is anchored early by ~120 words; no teleporting props or outline-like sequencing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "salt-cured timber" and "bruised plums" filtering through Elara's POV; the Driftwood Orchard and Great Trunk constrain choices by shaping her tactics against the storm. The environment charges the final image as the ocean "played the orchard," reinforcing theme. Spatial choreography is coherent, with no generic placeholder or white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survival of the orchard) is signaled early with "imminent violence," escalating under causal lens through Elara's agency: her fractal generating forces the storm to conform, narrowing options. Cost is legible in the "fading hum" and her exertion, altering tactics without coincidence. One meaningful tightening (the storm's shift to harmony) forecloses destruction with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transforming obstacles emerges through events and images, not statement; the core concept of sketched resonance integrates with Elara's actions, culminating in a non-literal answer as chaos "surrendered its identity." Subtext operates in implication, such as the storm becoming a "symphony," avoiding moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete struggle, with resonant ambiguity in the final smile.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with distinct perceptual signature in Elara's poetic, professional lens (e.g., "interprets cloud movements"). Voice modulates with pressure, using rhythmic syntax like "She struck again, and then again" without head-hopping. No dialogue, but elision is taught and paid off in closure; diction remains within her lexicon, enhancing cohesion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without scaffolding; figurative language like "ocean played the orchard" is purposeful and consistent. Minor overwriting in dense metaphors (e.g., "restless euphony of whispers") slightly blurs peak beats but doesn't harm clarity. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; read-aloud test passes with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Concept of sketched resonance and fractal generating offers a fresh synthesis, transforming the storm trope through specific, grounded choices in character and world. Turns feel earned in hindsight, with risk-taking in the lyrical, non-linear structure heightening stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, and the premise is indispensable to closure.</comment>
