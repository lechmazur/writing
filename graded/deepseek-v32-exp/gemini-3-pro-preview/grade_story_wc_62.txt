<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to capture collective grief is clear and intensifies, driving his actions; his micro-choices, like climbing the ladder to measure the moth, reveal embodied emotion and internal conflict. The revelation is earned through prior causality, with cost felt in his trembling and the permanent insight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Elias realizes grief is a tangled knot, reweighting his understanding; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with cost legible when he descends and carves. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight from lessons to insight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting constrains choices, such as using the ribbon against the glass, and charges the final image with its amber light and butterfly coating. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's POV, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the Accumulative lens as Elias moves from observation to actively retracing the moth's flight, narrowing options and deepening knowledge. Agency drives the revelation, with cost visible in his trembling and the locked insight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events, like the ribbon forming a knot, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to grief's nature. Subtext operates in gestures and symbols, avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic voice that reflects Elias's meditative nature; rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision (e.g., ghost's communication) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story and atmosphere without loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats like the revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes gravestone carving, spectral mentorship, and butterfly migration with specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in symbolic approach heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
