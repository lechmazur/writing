<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's characterization is deeply rooted in his role as a "creeping normality noticer," with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. His internal conflict and the earned momentary absolution show cost and consistency, compelling higher-stakes choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with accumulative/textural drive lens, leading to a resonant reconfiguration closure where cost is legible in the guilt lifting. Orientation is clear early, and causality holds without breaks, with the tea house transition serving as a decisive change.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes around preserving memory escalate through Elias's agency, with a meaningful tightening in the ritual eating; cost is felt in the tenuous absolution, under the accumulative lens, and closure forecloses paths with visible cost.</comment>
