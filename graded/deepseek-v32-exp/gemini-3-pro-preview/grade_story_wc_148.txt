<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to escape scapegoating is clear and consistent, driving his actions; interiority is shown through embodied emotion like trembling fingers and use of the lattice. However, internal conflict is somewhat subdued, with resignation overshadowing contradictory impulses, limiting depth in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with Elian's disappearance, carrying conceptual cost under a causal lens; his reputation as a persistent constraint shapes tactics, and orientation is anchored early. The escape via metaphysical door feels earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the lighthouse prison's geometry constraining choice and enabling the escape; the lattice object charges the final image, and sensory details like "copperlight repose" are purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are tightly focused on escape from scapegoating, escalating under causal lens through Elian's agency; the cost of disappearance is legible, though the timeframe pressure could be more visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images like the lattice and escape, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to truth and legacy; subtext in the confessional relic enriches without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and rhythmic control; perceptual signature is clear in phrases like "copperlight repose," and elision (e.g., metaphysical door) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with high information density; no major artifacts or loops, though minor overwriting in metaphors like "copperlight repose" slightly risks clarity without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is highly original, synthesizing lighthouse prison with reality fault lines; escape method feels inevitable, and risk-taking in metaphysical elements heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
