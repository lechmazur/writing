<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices that reveal his values. The final renunciation is earned by the parasol tip discovery, with visible cost in his acceptance of death. Minor abstraction in detachment doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual repricing via the parasol tip realization, reweighting endings as whispers with felt cost in Elias's decision to proceed. Accumulative/textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the drift-ice marina and parasol tip charging the final image. Details are selective and POV-filtered, constraining choice through the environment's pressure on Elias's search.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elias's agency in trawling debris, leading to the epiphany that deepens his understanding of endings. Cost is legible in his foreclosed path to euthanasia delay, under accumulative lens.</comment>
