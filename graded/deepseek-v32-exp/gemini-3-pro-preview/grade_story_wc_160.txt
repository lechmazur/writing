<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and rooted in compassion versus duty, with embodied emotion (trembling hands from adrenaline) and micro-choices under pressure. His final action is earned by prior causality, and internal conflict is dramatized without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (risk of treason and physical strain), and the causal lens holds tightly from discovery to execution. The thermal expansion constraint shapes tactics, and orientation is anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice (volcanic thermal expansion enables the bypass). Sensory details (groans of rock, heat waves) are purposeful, and the amphitheater charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes (saving lives vs. obedience) escalate through Elian's agency, with visible cost in the climax. The chain mechanism narrows options, and pressure coheres under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of encrypted compassion emerges through events and images, not statement, with a resonant ending that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext is woven into actions and discoveries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., blueprint discovery) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied syntax and no artifacts. Figurative language ("deep, resonant groans") enhances atmosphere without muddle, and closure beats are clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing unique elements (volcanic amphitheater, encrypted glue) with organic risk-taking. The resolution feels inevitable from established particulars.</comment>
