<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies from curiosity to protective agency, with embodied emotion like "trembling thumb" and internal conflict against protocol. Her final choice to assure the spirit is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in adrenaline drain and the changed photograph. Contradictory impulses act in scene, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the photograph shifts to include the spirit, a resonant reconfiguration under the causal lens. Cost is legible in Elara's gasping breath and the "reeling hush." Orientation is clear early, and the hearing aid as a persistent constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with the mist-clad atrium and marble fountain, constraining choices as the mist coalesces into threatening shadows. The hearing aid and photograph function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Elara's professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from bureaucratic duty to protecting a vulnerable spirit, driven by Elara's agency in using the hearing aid and photograph. Cost is unmistakable in the shadows' attack and her shield of recognition. The causal lens tightens options meaningfully, with no coincidence resolving the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of incidental heroism emerges organically from Elara's curiosity and refusal to walk away, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the changed photograph, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures like her whispered assurance and the final silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature biased toward "arterial lines of affection" and "ozone and sorrow." Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., "static roared... nearly knocking her to her knees." No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language like "weight of a thousand unsaid goodbyes" is consistent and clarity is maintained even in peak beats. Sentence propulsion accelerates with the conflict, e.g., "The shadows lunged."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise of a "contact tracer for hearts" is a fresh synthesis, transforming ghost story tropes through specific, grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in the supernatural elements heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
