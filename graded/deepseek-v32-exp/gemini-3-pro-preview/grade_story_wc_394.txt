<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Unit Seven's agency under the accumulative lens, as he modifies his chassis and uses the arrow tip to record wind patterns, with cost legible in the risk of dissolution. The stake—ascending to ring the bell—tightens meaningfully, and the final act forecloses other paths with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of transcendent yearning emerges through events and images, not statement, with the final bell-ringing offering a resonant, non-literal answer to meaning in isolation.
