<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Julian's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot with radical candor.

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Vance signs the authorization, with felt cost in his trembling and retreat. Causal lens holds tightly from Julian's setup to the ink's effect. Orientation is immediate, and the ink pot constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like "gleaming stainless steel" and "chemical warmth," enhancing atmosphere. However, the funeral home does not strongly constrain choices; the ink pot carries more weight. Micro-setting via the ink pot charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes for Elena's asylum are clear and escalate through Vance's arrival and the ink's use.

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth as magic emerges organically from the ink's action and Julian's motive, without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material through Vance's empathy, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to fairness in an unjust world.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>POV shifts from Julian to Vance mid-scene without section breaks, causing slight instability; Julian's perceptual signature is strong, but Vance's interiority intrudes.

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propelled with high information density, though minor overwriting appears in phrases like "deathly vitality." No major loops or artifacts; sentence variety supports rhythm. Closure image remains clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of magical realism with political asylum feels fresh and inevitable.
