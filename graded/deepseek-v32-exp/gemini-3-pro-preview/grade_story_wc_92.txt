<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, driving high-stakes choices; her calm inventiveness is embodied in micro-choices under pressure, such as moving with "liquid grace." However, minor lack of internal contradiction or visible cost in her final stance slightly limits depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with tight linkage; closure is a decisive change where the fort's power source is reconfigured, cost legible in the conceptual shift to "a lantern of secrets." Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the sundial and gardens constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details like "photoreactive compound" are filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of liberation escalates under causal lens through Elara's agency, narrowing options during the blackout; cost is legible in the risk taken and the silent success, foreclosing the old system with tangible change.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silent revolution emerges through events and images, not statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the fort as "lantern of secrets," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is controlled and poetic, e.g., "liquid grace of a dancer," and elision like purposeful compression in climax beats is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "ghost veins" serves clarity and propulsion, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes kinetic energy and archaic methods in a fresh, non-obvious way; tropes are transformed through specific details like the sundial's role, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
