<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Silas's characterization is strong with consistent traits and micro-choices under pressure, such as his hollow ache and decision to end the ritual. Elena's motivation is clear but slightly one-dimensional, though her trembling and apology dramatize her grief. The final choice to cut the power is earned by the spiking readings, with cost visible in Elena's weeping and the burn mark.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change: the apology is given and accepted, but sorrow remains, and Silas leaves with a hollow ache. The causal lens holds tightly, driven by the induction ritual causing the ghost's manifestation. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the frost burn and weeping.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like lignin smell and grime-streaked windows, charging the atmosphere. The perfume bottle as micro-setting constrains the ritual, and the orchard hush tightens decisions, culminating in the chainsaws' roar that mirrors the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elena's need to apologize—escalates under the causal lens through Silas's agency in the ritual. Cost is unmistakable in the ghost's agonized static, the frost burn, and Elena's weeping, forcing a trade-off with imperfect resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect miracles emerges through events like the ghost's jagged form and Silas's "broken mirror" metaphor, offering a non-literal answer to grief without moralizing. Subtext operates in the ghost's silent scream and the enduring sorrow, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—Silas's metaphorical, gritty voice—and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with Elena's whispers and Silas's rusty tone carrying subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with purposeful figurative language like "viscous memory" and no loops or artifacts. Sentences propel the story forward, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes supernatural and scientific elements freshly, with electromagnetic induction for exorcism. Specific details like copper wiring and the orchard hush heighten stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
