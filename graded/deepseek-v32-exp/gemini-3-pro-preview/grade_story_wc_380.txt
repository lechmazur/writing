<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices (e.g., trembling hand with coffee grounds). His final renunciation of fear is earned by prior causality, and the wildflowers act as a psychic anchor with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Elias reclaims his memory and stabilizes the gravity, with felt cost in the drop onto salt flats. Causal lens holds tightly, and orientation is anchored early with who, where, and when.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (e.g., gravity pockets force navigation via coffee grounds) and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, reflecting urgency and POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, with gravity fluctuations tightening stakes. Cost is legible when weightlessness threatens Elias, and his use of the memory as an anchor resolves the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory and loss emerges through particulars like the wildflowers and salt crystal, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext operates in implication without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm and diction reflect Elias's mindset under pressure. No head-hopping, and purposeful compression enhances clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats like the gravity fluctuation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes fresh elements (whale beaches, memory deletion) with organic specificity. Risk-taking in world-building heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
