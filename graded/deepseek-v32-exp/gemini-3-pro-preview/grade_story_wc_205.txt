<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and rooted in his past as a revolutionary, driving his actions to reimagine history. His internal conflict is embodied through micro-choices like covering mirrors and using the shard, with a credible endurance of sorrow at the end. The final renunciation of bringing back the dead is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the closure. Minor hairline slip in slightly over-articulated sorrow, but closure remains strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where Elian's victory reweights the past with his vision, costing him the inability to revive the dead, felt in the final lines. Causal lens holds tightly from setup (dispute) to climax (projection). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the shard's use pays off early teaching. Persistent constraint of time storm shapes tactics, and cost is legible in "burdened by the victory."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices: the baroque asteroid and time storm force Elian's mirror-covering and shard alignment. Sensory details like "phosphorescent pollen" and "swirling, luminous chronology" are purposeful and POV-filtered. The environment charges the final image by enabling the projection, and spatial choreography is coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Conflict escalates under causal lens from verbal dispute to physical action during the storm, driven by Elian's agency in devising the projection. Stakes are clear: reimagining civilization versus authoritarian history. Cost is legible in Thorne's shaken belief and Elian's sorrow, narrowing options. One meaningful tightening suffices, though escalation is slightly reliant on the storm's convenience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory versus history emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in Elian's actions. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the projected vision and Elian's cost-laden victory. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the fabrication's beauty. Recurring motifs like the shard and sorrow charge closure without checklist reliance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV from Elian is stable, with a distinct poetic voice that modulates under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, reflecting status dynamics with Thorne. Purposeful elision in time storm mechanics is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent, though minor register drift in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Figurative language like "heavy jewel of carved obsidian" is coherent and not overwhelming. No major artifacts or loops; closure image is clear. Minor overwriting in "burnished sorrow" repetition, but propulsion remains strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh with time as visible matter and archaeological dispute, transformed through specific character choices. Tropes of revolution are grounded in Elian's flaws. Risk-taking with the projection scene heightens stakes without gimmickry. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, and emotional specificity avoids templates.</comment>
