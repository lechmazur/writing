<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Silas's characterization is strong with consistent traits and motivation; his serenity and calligrapher precision inform his actions under pressure, and his final choice to reverse the narrative is earned. However, interior contradiction is minimal, and emotional depth is more implied than deeply embodied in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost through the audience's half-lit epiphanies and the heckler's silence, under a causal lens; the story stick constrains tactics, and orientation is clear early. The reversal action drives a decisive conceptual repricing of storytelling ethics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—the radar dome's acoustics and dim lighting amplify mood and silence, while the story stick as a micro-setting tool constrains choices and charges the final image with tangible cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes on ethical storytelling escalate through Silas's agency in reversing the puppet show, narrowing options and changing knowledge; cost is legible in the audience's realization and the foreclosed path of linear narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from the reversal action and half-lit epiphanies, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; the ending reweights prior material through conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, lyrical voice reflective of Silas's calligrapher precision; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision in the reversal is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density, but minor overwriting (e.g., "meteor hush") slightly risks clarity without harming closure; no loops or artifacts obscure cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is freshly synthesized—subversive puppet show reversing tragedy to explore ethics—with risk-taking that heightens stakes; the combination feels organic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
