<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice of exile is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her transformation and departure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Lyra steps into darkness, reconfiguring her options under an accumulative/textural lens. The nostalgia ban and inscription ritual create coherent causality, and the ending image charges the stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the twilight garden and artificial constellations filtering through Lyra's POV. The glass stylus and her body act as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (personal freedom vs. conformity), and escalation is driven by Lyra's agency in the inscription ritual. Cost is legible in the pain and permanent exile, tightening under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, with subtext in the rebellion against oppression. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Lyra carrying the tides, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature that reflects Lyra's mindset. Rhythmic control under pressure supports the accumulative drive, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of tide dancing, nostalgia ban, and cosmic inscription. Risk-taking in style and concept heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
