<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's cognitive curse is concretely embodied and drives her micro-choices under pressure, with the final lever pull earned by prior causality and visible cost (breaking the seal). Interiority avoids stock phrasing, and her struggle with temporal blindness creates credible internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (pulling the lever) and felt cost (embracing the unknown), under a consistent causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and the Steward's directive persistently constrains tactics until her rejection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting vividly pressures choices through decay and the storm, with sensory details (ozone, moss) filtered through POV. The bunker and red box constrain action and charge the final image, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate coherently under the causal lens, driven by Elara's agency in breaking the seal and pulling the lever. Cost is legible on-page as she forecloses safety for chaos, with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transcending linear safety emerges through concrete actions and images (wafer seal, storm), without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the lever pull and merger with the storm.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic rhythm and perceptual signature (e.g., "magnetic hum," "ethereal grit"). Experimental elements like dream sequences are taught and legible, enhancing pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Figurative language ("geometric light," "breaking chain") is purposeful and coherent, accelerating toward the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes cognitive curse and decaying AI with non-obvious specificity, transforming tropes through Elara's unique limitation. Risk-taking in structure and tone heightens stakes, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
