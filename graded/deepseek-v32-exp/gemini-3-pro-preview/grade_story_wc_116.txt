<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to witness change without judgment is clear and consistent, driving her actions. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like "smile of vague recognition" and "gripped reality loosely," showing character under pressure. The final choice to use the origami swan is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the library's collapse. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws like her loose grip on reality complicate choices credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Drive lens is accumulative/textural, focusing on atmosphere and decay, held throughout. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elara reaches the obsidian refuge, accepting the library's end with cost legible in "the crumbling peace." Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks. The origami swan's use as a transition vessel is set up early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—overgrown library, catacombs, obsidian refuge—with sensory details like "damp earth" and "bioluminescent light" that pressure choices (rising damp forces action). The environment constrains tactics and charges the final image; micro-setting (origami swan) reweights meaning. Spatial choreography is coherent, with no generic placeholder elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Elara's need to reach the refuge to observe change, signaled early. Escalation under accumulative lens: rising damp forces a tightening, leading to her agency in using the origami swan. Cost is legible in the library's collapse and her renunciation. No coincidence; pressure coheres through a single meaningful deepening that forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of acceptance and regenerative silence emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of Elara as "keeper of the quiet," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in symbols like the origami swan, with purposeful ambiguity that lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature (e.g., "vines decided books were trelliswork"). Rhythm and syntax vary purposefully under pressure; no head-hopping. Elision in the transition via origami is taught and paid off at closure. Dialogue absent, so not applicable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "boundary between what was and what is had softened like wet paper"). Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs; no register drift or artifacts in peak beats. Closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of origami as spatial transition, overgrown library, and obsidian refuge, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in poetic, accumulative style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through specific details and emotional truth, avoiding derivative templates.</comment>
