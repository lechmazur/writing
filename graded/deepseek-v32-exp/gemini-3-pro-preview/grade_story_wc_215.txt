<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his tranquil perceptiveness, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., ignoring the ghost's plea) that reveal his values. However, interior contradiction is minimal, as he remains steadfast, slightly limiting depth in such a short piece.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under an accumulative/textural lens, with cost legible in the ghost's transformation to peace. The drive lens holds, and the covenant constraint shapes tactics, though the single-scene structure is simple but effective.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with the apiary and wasteland pressuring choices and charging the final image through sensory details like "petrified honeycomb." The stained glass box acts as a micro-setting that constrains action and deepens theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes around preserving silence escalate under the accumulative lens through Elias's agency, with a meaningful tightening as he denies the ghost, forcing a trade-off with legible cost. However, the conflict is internalized, lacking external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken words emerges through images and actions, not statement, with subtext in gestures like the ghost's muted pleas. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the reconfigured covenant, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Elias's contextual clue-reading and poetic diction. Voice remains coherent under pressure, and elision (e.g., ghostly silence) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied syntax and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language (e.g., "visual screaming") is purposeful, and information advances story without padding, though minor overwriting in descriptive passages.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes post-apocalyptic and ghost elements with originality, transformed through specific details like the stained glass box. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes, and the concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
