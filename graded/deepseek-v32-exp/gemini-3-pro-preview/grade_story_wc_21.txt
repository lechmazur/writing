<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with embodied emotion (tears evaporating) and micro-choices (arranging debris) revealing values under pressure. The final negotiation feels earned, though some interiority edges toward summary rather than full contradiction in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with cost (figure's relief, lagoon solidifying) under a causal lens; orientation is anchored early, and the drive from letters to cipher holds without breaks, making the change legible and resonant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon constrains choice (forcing debris communication) and charges the final image with its transformation; sensory details (viscous fluid, heat) are selective and purposeful, deeply integrated with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens, from initial discovery to risky negotiation; cost is legible in the emotional weight and environmental shift, tightening options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of truth and witness emerges through particulars (debris symbols, final exchange) without moralizing; the ending reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity, though it leans slightly toward stated concepts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "suffocating weight of forgotten injustices"); voice remains coherent under pressure, and any elision (like the cipher details) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without major artifacts; minor overwriting ("searing reverie") doesn't obscure clarity, and propulsion is maintained through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes fresh elements (floating library, retrocognitive haunting) with specificity; risk-taking in paranormal communication heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
