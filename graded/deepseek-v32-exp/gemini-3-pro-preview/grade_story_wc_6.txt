<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her backstory as the arsonist's daughter, driving her actions with unyielding compassion. Interiority is concrete, shown through micro-choices like grafting the moss, and her final emotional release validates her arc. The contradiction between her father's destruction and her restoration is embodied in scene, earning the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the branch hums, validating Elara's compassion with felt cost in her held breath. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through detailed imagery to the transformative moment. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of her father's trauma shapes the entire narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon constrains choice by serving as the essential medium for the graft, charging the final image with its dark, still waters. Sensory details are vivid and selective, filtered through Elara's POV, such as the "low, resonant hum" rising from the depths. The setting is integral to the action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Elara's internal conflict to prove scars can sing, escalating through her agency in the grafting process. Under the accumulative lens, density increases to the climax where the branch hums, with cost legible in her anticipation and release. The escalation is driven by her choices, narrowing options to this singular outcome.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transformation and compassion emerges through concrete actions and images, not statement, with the branch's hum offering a non-literal answer to trauma. Subtext operates in the grafting process and the final music, resisting moralizing. The ending reweights prior material without abstraction, arising from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct poetic voice that reflects Elara's perceptual signature, such as noticing the "woolly armadas" of clouds. Rhythm and diction are controlled under pressure, with purposeful elision in the grafting details. No head-hopping or register shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and lyrical rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "the branch into a living cello," with no muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with the scene's tranquility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of arsonist's daughter turned firefighter and the grafting ritual, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details like the volcanic sand and foreign coin are irreplaceable.</comment>
