<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and rooted in his naive yet devoted character, with embodied emotions (trembling fingers, unblinking eyes) and micro-choices under pressure. His final action is earned by prior causality, though his one-dimensional nature slightly limits depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost: the bell's toll pulls moisture, causing the sea's return. Causal lens holds strong, with Elian's actions directly leading to the outcome. Orientation is clear early, and the ending reconfigures the world state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the Sapphire Viaduct's height affecting temperature and the bell constraining choices. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, charging the final image of the geyser.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start, escalating through Elian's precise dripping actions under pressure. Agency drives the tightening, with cost legible in his psychological risk and the final geyser. Causal linkage is strong.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of devotion and balance emerges through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with meaningful ambiguity, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature. Voice is poetic yet controlled, reflecting Elian's perspective. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops or artifacts; figurative language is consistent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion supports the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of "lukewarm mage" and dripping-rate magic feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming familiar tropes.</comment>
