<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices that reveal his hierarchy of values. His final breach of protocol is earned by prior causality, showing a decisive change from observer to witness with visible cost. The client applies secondary pressure, but Silas's arc dominates.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly, with closure as a decisive change when Silas confides the engineered collapse, costing his professional distance. Orientation is anchored early, and the plot escalates through measured linkages. The closure unit lands with felt cost in his hammering pulse and the rain's symbolism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like wet concrete and onyx ink, constraining choices through tools like the measuring tape and charging the final image of the rain-distorted skyline. The loft atmosphere mirrors internal states, but the skylight itself is more decorative than causal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Silas's agency under the causal lens, from measuring cards to the revelation of engineered demolition, with cost legible in his breached protocol and the client's horror. The dominant stake in understanding loss tightens meaningfully, foreclosing his observer role.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the clash between tangible and digital worlds, with subtext in symbols like the crumbling tower and measuring tape.

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with vivid imagery and varied syntax that avoids loops or scaffold.
