<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's logical and tranquil perceptiveness is consistently embodied through micro-choices like suppressing doubt and adjusting the stamp, with his motivation to trace honest origins intensifying under pressure. The final resolve to disseminate the truth is earned by prior causality, though minor hairline slips include somewhat tidy emotional control without deeper irrationality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly from blackout enabling investigation to decisive closure with cost—the revelation of Aethelgard's penal colony origins reconfigures Elian's understanding and stakes. Orientation is anchored early, and the stamp's click as a micro-turn tightens options seamlessly, with cost legible in his "terrifying reality" and dissemination plan.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with bioluminescent algae and reinforced glass, pressuring choices through the reclaimed stillness that enables the stamp's use. The library as micro-setting constrains tactics, and sensory details like "shifting aquatic shadows" reflect POV bias, though minor reliance on visual senses slightly limits full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth versus survival escalates through protagonist agency under causal lens: blackout creates opportunity, stamp misfit prompts adjustment, and discovery forces a costly trade-off. The risk of suffocation and brutal truth heightens tension, with closure reweighting options via Elian's resolved dissemination.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of fabricated history versus honest origins emerges organically through the stamp's revelation, with subtext in the prison manifest shifting meaning without moralizing. The ending conceptually reprices the city's foundation with undeniable cost, though the theme echoes slightly in Elian's calculated pursuit without deeper ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature—logical, observant syntax reflecting Elian's temperament—and purposeful compression in high-pressure beats like stamp adjustment. No head-hopping or register drift, and elision (e.g., city's vibrations) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing plot and atmosphere without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "darkness became not merely an absence of light but a physical weight" is coherent and voice-motivated, and closure propulsion is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes sunken city tropes with fresh ingenuity via the stamp as decryption key and reclaimed stillness concept, transforming familiar elements through specific stakes. Risk-taking in quiet, investigative closure heightens tension, and the revelation feels inevitable in hindsight, though minor derivative notes in the "hidden truth" arc limit peak originality.</comment>
