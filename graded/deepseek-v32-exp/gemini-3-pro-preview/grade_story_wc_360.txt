<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Operator's shifting personas and consuming motivation are vividly embodied, driving the plot; Kael's characterization is functional but less deep, with his hollowing serving as a visible cost. The final choice to continue is earned by prior causality, though Kael's internal conflict lacks full contradiction in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change for Kael and resonant reconfiguration for Operator under a causal lens; cost is legible in Kael's emptiness and the dying stars. Orientation is clear early, and structure coheres with motivated ellipsis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Topaz walls and halo fragment constrict choices and charge the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, with the setting mirroring internal states through vibration and light. Micro-setting elements pressure tactics and enhance atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under causal lens via Operator's agency, forcing Kael's endurance with unmistakable cost in his hollowing. Dominant stake (understanding emotion) tightens through the press operation, foreclosing options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of emotional mathematics emerges through events and images, not statement; ending reweights prior material with conceptual cost in the dying stars and Operator's continuity. Subtext operates in implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic with controlled POV shifts at clear beats; perceptual signature is consistent, and dialogue is natural but minimal. Minor stability note in focalization, but elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or scaffolds; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports momentum and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes unique elements (halo fragment, transposed empathy) with specificity; risk-taking in structure and tone heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation of tropes feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
