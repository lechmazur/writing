<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; his interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as his firm touch. Clara's characterization through the record shard reveals flawed humanity. The final choice to play the cello is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her peaceful death.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Clara's death) with felt cost in the "full silence." Orientation is clear early; causality is tight from the nurse's signal to the music. The record shard's recurrence charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (sterile room transformed by music) and charges the final image; sensory details like "scent of hope" are selective and purposeful. The record shard and cello function as micro-settings that alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (flawless goodbye) escalates under Accumulative lens through Elias's agency; cost is legible in Clara's relaxation and the final stillness. One meaningful tightening occurs as the music bridges her transition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of wholeness in brokenness emerges through particulars like the record shard and music; subtext operates in gesture and silence. The ending offers a non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and controlled under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but natural; elision (e.g., scent of hope) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variation; no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language ("pulsing stillness") is consistent and clear, even in peak beats. Minor overwriting in early description doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of hospice music therapy feels inevitable; risk-taking in tone and concept heightens stakes. The record shard and scent of hope transform familiar material with specificity, supporting closure.</comment>
