<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure. The final action of transferring energy is earned by prior causality, though internal conflict is subtle rather than sharply contradictory. Embodied emotion and spatial imagination trait are well-integrated, with cost felt in the film strip's inert state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive conceptual repricing as love is preserved in the lens, reconfiguring meaning with undeniable cost (film strip inert, world exhaling). Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, building through sensory density and emotional pressure. Orientation is clear early, and causality flows seamlessly from Elara's actions to the resonant ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory details (ozone, velvet darkness) that pressure choices and charge the final image. The projection booth and film strip act as micro-settings that constrain tactics, enabling the psychometric process. Spatial choreography is coherent, and atmosphere mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding unused love) escalates under accumulative lens through hushed thunder and emotional intensity, driven by Elara's agency in incubating the film and directing energy. Cost is legible in the strip's inert state and the preserved love, foreclosing other paths with felt pressure. One meaningful tightening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of unused love emerges organically from images and events, with subtext in gestures and implication. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the lens nebula, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and lingers through particulars, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature reflective of Elara's spatial imagination. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and purposeful elision (e.g., psychometry mechanics) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; diction remains within character lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, though minor overwriting in descriptions exists without harming clarity. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative build, and closure image is undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, synthesizing crystal gazing, psychometry, and film in a non-obvious way that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional specificity avoids templates. The core concept is fully committed to, with transformation through lived detail.</comment>
