<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's scheming pacifism is consistently embodied through calculated micro-choices, such as pressing the cylinder to Kaelen's wrist, and Kaelen's transformation is earned via cellular memory, with cost legible in his drained tension and liquefied sword. The final renunciation forecloses his warlord path with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a decisive change with felt cost under the causal lens; Kaelen's surrender and the cylinder's disappearance are driven by Elian's engineered transfer, and the soundless setting persistently constrains tactics. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is unmistakable when the sword liquefies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The Soundless Sanctuary's nullified acoustics and shifting geometry pressure choices by forcing intimate, silent conflict, while the mercury floor and transparent glass walls charge the final image of Kaelen's psyche rearranging. The environment constrains Elian's method, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elian's agency under the causal lens, from Kaelen swatting the cylinder to the cellular memory transfer that narrows options and forces surrender with cost in the sword's dissolution. The dominant stake of convincing Kaelen tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of shifting grace emerges through the broken pin's void, offering a non-literal answer to strength and flaw without moralizing; the ending reweights prior material as the cylinder vanishes, and subtext operates in silence and sensory data.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is largely stable with Elian's focalization, but brief head-hopping into Kaelen's sensory experience during the transfer is smooth and purposeful. Voice has a distinct, poetic texture with rhythmic control under pressure, and elision (e.g., soundlessness) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variation without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "vertiginous void" is coherent and peaks in the closure beat. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the transfer, maintaining clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of scheming pacifism, soundless conflict, and cellular memory feels inevitable and fresh, with risk-taking in the silent confrontation heightening stakes. The broken pin as a flaw-turned-grace transforms tropes through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
