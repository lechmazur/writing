<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her expertise, driving key choices like using the diary to confront the golem. However, interiority is somewhat abstract, with limited embodied emotion or internal conflict under pressure, reducing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strong with clear orientation and closure; the rescue mission pivots to escape with cost legible in the Traveler's aged burden and the mountain's satisfied hum. Minor ellipsis in the golem's acquiescence slightly softens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, constraining choices (e.g., the golem's paper joints) and charging the final image with the mountain's slumber. Sensory details like "ink-black ivy" are purposeful and filtered through Elara's expertise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate coherently under causal lens, with Elara's agency driving the pivotal renegotiation with the golem, narrowing options and incurring cost (Traveler's digestion). One meaningful tightening suffices, though the confrontation resolves quickly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of accepting the past emerges through particulars like the Library of Unlearned Lessons and the Traveler's regret, with subtext in Elara's closing line. Resonant without moralizing, but lacks deeper ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "syntax of silence"); voice remains coherent under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., gaps in the diary) pays off at closure. Dialogue is minimal but effective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, advancing story without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "symphony of suspended thought" is consistent, though slightly overwritten in peaks, not harming clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of concepts (living library, linguistic magic) feels inevitable; tropes are transformed through specific details like the botanical diary, and risk-taking in world-building heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
