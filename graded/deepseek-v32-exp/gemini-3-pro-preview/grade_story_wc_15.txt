<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her rebellion against fatalism, with actions that align consistently. However, the lack of on-page internal conflict or contradictory impulses prevents a higher score, as her determination is unwavering without visible struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a conceptual repricing as the labyrinth is transformed into a tapestry, with felt cost in Elara's collapse. The accumulative/textural lens holds strong, driven by sensory details and pattern-building, and the orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, constraining choices through the tidal clock and labyrinth structure, and charging the final image with the stitched scar. Vivid, selective sensory details like the red canyon and orchid solace are woven into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency in sewing the chasms, under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in her physical exertion and the lethal drop. The dominant stake of restoring the labyrinth tightens meaningfully through her sleepwalking paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, with subtext in the plate as blueprint and sewing as mending, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting decay into reverence through the stitched scar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively poetic, with Elara's perceptual signature filtering the world. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision in the trance state is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "bruising shadows" and "petrify upon contact" is coherent and purposeful, advancing story momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The concept of a wharf weaver mending geography via sleepwalking sewing is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure recharges prior material.</comment>
