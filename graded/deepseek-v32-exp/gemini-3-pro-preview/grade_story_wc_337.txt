<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion (trembling hands) and internal conflict between duty and guilt. The final choice to silence his brother is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his unrest. Contradictory impulses act in scene, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elian grounds the spirit but remains unsettled, with felt cost ("his own unrest would never settle"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through building silence, and orientation is clear early. Persistent constraints (net, silence) shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the prism sanctuary and starlight dissecting the sky to pressure choices. The net and needle function as micro-settings that constrain actions and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, avoiding cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grounding the spirit) is signaled early; escalation is driven by Elian's agency in unraveling knots, releasing silence that chokes the scream. Cost is legible in the violent silence and his unrest. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of guilt and silence emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in the brother secret. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the "violent" silence, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and controlled under pressure, with rhythmic prose reflecting Elian's state. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (the secret) is taught and paid off at closure. Diction remains within character lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clarity, with no loops or scaffold. Syntax varies naturally, and figurative language ("invisible syrup") coheres without muddle. Rhythm accelerates with scene needs, and closure image is sharp. Read-aloud test passes seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and organic, synthesizing mask restoration, accumulated silence, and brotherly guilt into a non-obvious whole. Emotional specificity avoids tropes, and risk-taking in style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
