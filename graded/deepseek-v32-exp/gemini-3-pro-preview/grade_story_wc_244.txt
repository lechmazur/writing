<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Arthur's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion (e.g., "desperately jocular" humor masking terror). His final choice to discard the moon rock is earned by prior causality, demonstrating a credible change with visible cost. However, minor diagnostic label-speak ("the catalyst had not been the rock, but the risk") slightly reduces specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (Arthur discards the rock and connects through music), under a causal lens that holds throughout. Cost is legible in the final image ("the silence retreated"), and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening. The rumor chain method integrates smoothly without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful (e.g., "ivy held up the crumbling Victorian brickwork"), with sensory detail filtered through Arthur's POV. However, while it enriches atmosphere, it does not strongly constrain choices or charge the final image beyond mirroring internal states, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (loneliness vs. connection) escalates under the causal lens through Arthur's agency, culminating in his risky decision to discard the moon rock. Cost is unmistakable on the page ("the risk of letting it go"), and the tightening forecloses his isolation with felt emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images (e.g., moon rock as false currency, music as true connection), with subtext in gesture and dialogue. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though it leans slightly explicit in the closure paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Arthur's worldview ("invoices never asked him why he was crying"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, and prose rhythm controls pressure without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic, with high information density and varied sentence structures. Minor figurative language in peak beats ("rumors spread like a benign virus") is coherent and purposeful, but a slight template cadence in descriptive passages prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of post-crisis logistics and emotional quest, transformed through specific details (e.g., moon rock as symbolic barter). Risk-taking in structure (shift from procedural to quiet narrative) heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
