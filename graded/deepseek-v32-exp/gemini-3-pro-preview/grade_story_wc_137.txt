<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is strong with concrete interiority and embodied emotion; her shift from skeptic to protector is earned through discovered causality, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a hierarchy of values. The final choice to risk academic standing for preserving grief has visible cost, satisfying the quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal drive lens with clear orientation; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as Elara reconfigures her role, with cost legible in her academic risk. The magic square tile acts as a persistent constraint shaping tactics, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (e.g., briny scent, stone floor), and the tower and tile constrain choices and charge the final image. POV bias filters description purposefully, avoiding generic placeholder issues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under causal lens through Elara's agency; her discovery deepens the dominant stake of preserving history, forcing a trade-off with academic risk. Cost is unmistakable in her decisive choice, and pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (e.g., whales, tile) without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer on memory and grief, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates through implication in images and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature blending scientific and empathetic tones; voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping. Elision (e.g., celestial patterns) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic control and high information density without loops or artifacts; sentences advance story and atmosphere with concise propulsion. Figurative language (e.g., "unheard symphony") is coherent and purpose-driven in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes math and emotion in a fresh, inevitable way; the magic square as anchor for memories transforms tropes through specific stakes. Risk-taking in blending genres heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
