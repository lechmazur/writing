<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through concrete actions like transcribing lyrics. His internal conflict between obedience and rebellion is embodied in micro-choices, such as hiding the glow, and the final act of dissemination is earned with visible cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; character remains flawed and resilient.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal drive with clear linkages: the radio broadcast leads to the glowing page, escalating to the patrol threat and closure where Elian hides the glow. Orientation is anchored early, and closure is a decisive change with felt cost (risk of death). The lens holds without ambiguity, and the ending reconfigures options through the dust dissemination plan.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices: the ember alcove provides cover, while the mist signals patrols, constraining Elian's actions. Sensory details (geothermal vents, damp air) are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV. The alcove directly charges the final image by enabling the concealment and dissemination process.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are dominant from the start (preserving stories against the regime), escalating when the page's glow attracts patrols. Elian's agency in cloaking the desk narrows options and carries cost (immediate danger). Under the causal lens, pressure tightens coherently, and the cost is legible in the risk of exposure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as the dust infusion representing memory rebellion. Subtext is woven into song lyrics and the final act of dissemination, offering a non-literal answer to the story famine. No moralizing; resonance arises from particulars like the "infection of wonder."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in Elian's poetic yet precise voice. Narrative distance remains consistent, and prose rhythm modulates with pressure (e.g., urgent scratching contrasted with calm resolution). No head-hopping or register drift; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical but clear, with high information density and varied sentence rhythm. No artifacts like loops or scaffold; figurative language (e.g., "gardener of ash") is integrated and coherent. Momentum is maintained through concrete actions, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is original, synthesizing dystopian rebellion with unique elements like dust-carried narratives. Tropes are transformed through specific details (e.g., song lyrics as code). The dust infusion premise feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
