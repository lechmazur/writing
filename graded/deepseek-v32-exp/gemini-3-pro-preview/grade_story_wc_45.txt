<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aris's characterization is deeply rooted in his traits as a forgiving skeptic, with clear motivation evolving from clinical doubt to embracing magic as uncodified science. Interiority is concrete and embodied, such as "felt his heart yearn," and micro-choices under pressure, like bypassing the stethoscope for bone-setting tools, reveal his values. The final choice to offer a map instead of death is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the parents' emotional shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot structure is causal and coherent, with orientation anchored early in the hedge maze and garden. Closure lands as a decisive change from grief to hope, driven by Aris's innovation with the tooth, and cost is legible in the "terrifying, beautiful hope." The causal lens holds without ambiguity, and the tooth acts as a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like "polished driftwood" and "ancient roses," filtered through Aris's POV to create atmosphere. The garden and body function as micro-settings that charge the final image, though environmental constraints on choices are subtle rather than pivotal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the real daughter versus accepting death—is signaled early and escalates through Aris's agency under the causal lens. His decision to treat the substitution as a map narrows options with cost legible in the emotional reconfiguration of the parents' hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and metaphors, such as "turn mistakes into constellations," blending science and magic without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and images, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct with a literary, medical-mystical blend, and POV is stable third-person limited. Perceptual signature is strong in Aris's observations, and minimal dialogue at the end is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with purposeful figurative language like "misplaced pearl." No significant loops or scaffolds; slight register elevation in "metaphysical joint" is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality lies in transforming the changeling trope through a scientific lens, with specific synthesis like bone setting as metaphor. The premise feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in blending genres heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
