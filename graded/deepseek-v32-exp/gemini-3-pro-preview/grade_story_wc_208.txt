<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her traits as a sculptor and learner; her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion under pressure, such as her "frantic purpose" and the "soothing, mechanical drone" post-resolution. The final choice to create the beacon is earned by prior causality, demonstrating a hierarchy of values with visible cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; micro-choices under stress reveal character consistency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change as the ship turns safely, under a causal lens that holds throughout; cost is legible in Elara's struggle against the gale and the adrenaline receding. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure is tight with one meaningful tightening from plea to resolution. The timewoven alliance concept shapes tactics without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory details (e.g., "damp, pitted concrete," "turbine-hum reverie") that reflect POV bias and urgency. The archway and generator constrain choices by providing shelter and resources for the beacon, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details are integrated into action, avoiding generic placeholder syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of saving the ship is signaled early; escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens, from the desperate plea to her active reimagining of the sculpture. Cost is legible in her physical struggle and the risk faced, with a meaningful tightening that narrows options. No coincidence resolves the conflict; resolution is earned through protagonist alteration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of timewoven alliances emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the projected phantom map and Elara's return to reverie. Subtext operates in the use of the lantern slide as a bridge between eras, avoiding moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and lingering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in Elara's poetic yet urgent narration; voice modulates with pressure (e.g., "frantically purpose" to "soothing drone"). No head-hopping; purposeful compression, such as the layered meanings of the slide, is taught and paid off. Rhythmic control under stress heightens clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts or loops; sentences advance story and atmosphere (e.g., "a brilliant, hard beam blasted through the antique slide"). No figurative muddle in peak beats; clarity and concision maintain momentum. Read-aloud ear test passes with syntactic variety and strong verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of driftwood art, historical cartography, and post-apocalyptic survival; tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices. The core premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth and specificity avoid derivative templates.</comment>
