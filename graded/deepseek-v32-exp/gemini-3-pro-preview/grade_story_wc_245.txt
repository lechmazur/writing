<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. Her interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices like trusting the ring despite panic revealing hierarchy of values. The final change to peace is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in tears. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in tears and internal silence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory accumulation to the stillpoint. Orientation is clear early, and the timeframe constraint shapes tactics. Causality is tight, with the ring guiding beats to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the Ultrasonic Forest constraining choices through tactile interactions with trees. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, mirroring internal states. The stillpoint acts as a key environmental pressure point for closure. No generic or static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of emotional closure escalates under Accumulative lens through note collection and time pressure. Agency is driven by Elara's dowsing and tree touches, narrowing options. Cost is unmistakable in panic and tears, leading to reweighted stakes. No coincidence or static conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness and internal mapping emerges implicitly from events and images, not statement. Subtext operates in the forest as mirror and melody as peace. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the silence within. No moralizing or thematic drift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature biased by Elara's sensory absorption. Syntax and rhythm reflect her urgency and calm, modulating with pressure. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without padding. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with no loops or scaffold issues. Clarity is maintained in peak beats, and propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of unique elements like language absorption and ultrasonic forest, transformed through specific character choices. Emotional truth avoids templates, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes. The closure feels inevitable in hindsight, with originality integral to logic.</comment>
