<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority shown through her ritual with the lantern glass. Her micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing the meteor's path, reveal a hierarchy of values, and her final renewal is earned by prior causality. However, contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized, limiting the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Elara's renewed spirit, under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The station and glass constrain tactics, and orientation is clear early. No causality breaks; the meteor event deepens stakes coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and POV-filtered, with sensory details like "cold luminescence" and "resonant hum" that reflect Elara's priorities. The observation deck and lantern glass constrain choices and charge the final image of stardust as holy ash, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal quest for meaning) escalates through the meteor event, driven by Elara's agency in empathizing and tracing the path. Cost is legible in her transformation, under the Accumulative lens, with a meaningful deepening that reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of strength in vulnerability emerges organically from the meteor's transformation and Elara's ritual, with subtext in imagery like "trading heavy existence for illumination." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature ("custodian of mysteries") that remains consistent under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, and rhythm controls heighten the closure effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with clear propulsion and no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "sleeping panther purr" is coherent and voice-motivated, though slight overwriting in peaks prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of cosmic janitor as mystic, with specific details like the yellow lantern glass transforming familiarity. Risk-taking in quiet narrative heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
