<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and contradictory impulses acting in scene; his final choice to extract hope is earned by prior causality, and the cost is visible in Elara's dimmed eyes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change and felt cost as hope is extracted, under a causal drive lens that holds; orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with no causality breaks.</comment>
