<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying through the layering process. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure, such as collecting fragments and assigning emotional weight. The final act of placing the label is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the constructed sorrow. However, contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orientation is anchored early with who, where, and when. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, building through sensory and emotional layers. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the final image of the label as a monument. The persistent constraint of the setting shapes tactics and the ending, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with the container labyrinth constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, such as the "rusted hollow" and "salt air." The environment subtly mirrors internal states and evolves with the tide, supporting theme without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering memories) is signaled early and escalates under the Accumulative lens through the protagonist's agency in layering stories. The process tightens with the label find, leading to a choice with felt cost in the "constructed sorrow." No coincidental resolution; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of erased histories emerges organically through images and actions, not statement. Subtext operates in the protagonist's methods and the final monument. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the "archivist" role.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature, filtering reality through a poetic, biased lens. Voice is consistent and rhythmic under pressure, with purposeful elision taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift; syntax reflects the protagonist's mindset.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story, character, and atmosphere seamlessly. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences are concise and vivid, such as "a rusted hollow between rows of steel giants." Read-aloud test passes with clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and synthesizes elements into an inevitable whole, with risk-taking in the accumulative style heightening stakes. The concept of reconstructing memories through fragments feels organic and specific, avoiding template plots. Emotional truth and specificity anchor universals without gimmickry.</comment>
