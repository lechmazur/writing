<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elias's internal conflict is embodied and concrete, with contradictory impulses acting in scene (e.g., hand shaking too violently to steady the compass). His final renunciation—accepting navigation by utility poles—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost ("the grand navigator was gone... leaving only a survivor"). The Accumulative lens holds, and the utility poles act as a persistent constraint shaping tactics. Orientation is anchored early in the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective (fog, brine, kayak launch), with sensory detail filtered through POV. The utility poles function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image, altering navigation tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict between past failure and movement) escalates under the Accumulative lens via protagonist agency (rejecting compass for poles). Cost is legible in the acceptance of smallness, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of acceptance emerges through particulars (compass vs. poles) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image of "navigation enough," reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (melancholic, biased perception). Voice modulates under pressure (e.g., rhythmic control in "He hummed a shanty... merrily melancholic"). No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and clear (e.g., "stitching the wound with copper wire"). No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of trauma and navigation via utility poles feels inevitable. Specific details (e.g., "ugly, reliable copper wires") transform the trope, and risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
