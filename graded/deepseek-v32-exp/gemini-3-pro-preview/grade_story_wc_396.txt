<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation to map empathy onto action is clear and consistently drives his choices; his interiority is concrete, such as when he "retreated into the metaphysical structure," and his final act of presenting the crystal is earned by prior causality with visible cost as shadows recede.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the council's shift in perspective, under a causal lens where Kaelen's search and reconstitution cause the change; cost is legible in the "shadows on his skin receded, calmed by the act of preservation," and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice—the lighthouse as repository guides Kaelen's search—and charges the final image with the "beacon as bright as the lighthouse itself"; sensory details like "smell of old paper and brass" are purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kaelen's agency under the causal lens, as his intuitive search narrows options to find the anomaly; cost is unmistakable in the effort to "reconstitute the scene" and the resulting shift in the council's resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of empathy and alternative paths emerges through events and images, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the projected scene of mercy, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a perceptual signature evident in phrases like "gnarled apple trees twisted defiantly"; voice maintains rhythmic control under pressure, and any elision (e.g., time dilation) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "tectonic complaints of a dying world" is coherent and purposeful, with no artifacts obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of metaphysical peacekeeping and empathy-driven action feels inevitable; risk-taking in the lighthouse repository and crystal reconstitution heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure reconfigures meaning.</comment>
