<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to graft onto the community is clear and consistent, driving her actions like comforting the boy and weaving the reeds. Interiority is concrete, but lacks strong internal contradiction or flawed struggle, keeping it from higher bands. The final choice to weave the reeds is earned by prior causality with visible cost, satisfying the quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara feels kinship barriers dissolve, with cost legible in the tactile communion. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern breaks and density increase reweight stakes. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor constraining choices (e.g., boy's injury) and charging the final image. Sensory details are filtered through Elara's POV, integrating action and atmosphere seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of belonging escalates through Elara's agency under the Accumulative lens, with key turns like comforting the boy and discovering the tag. Cost is legible when she weaves the reeds, narrowing options and foreclosing paths with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of soft vs. hard, fleeting vs. eternal emerges organically from events and images, not statement. Subtext operates in gestures like weaving, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though it leans slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic perceptual signature. Voice modulates with emotional pressure, and elision (e.g., silent world) is taught and paid off. Minimal dialogue (hum) is natural and goal-driven, but minor register consistency holds it back from higher bands.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and density, but minor overwriting (e.g., "luminescent ache") and figurative stacking in peak beats cause slight muddle. No major artifacts or loops, and closure remains clear, though momentum drags occasionally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of silent world and organic decay, transformed through specific character and setting. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight, though not fully rare.</comment>
