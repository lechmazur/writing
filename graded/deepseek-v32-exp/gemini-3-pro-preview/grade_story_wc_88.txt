<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost when Elias weeps, reconnecting his conscience.

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the bioluminescent lake constraining choice by showing timelines that pressure Elias's decision.

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of empathy vs. apathy escalates through Elias's agency under the causal lens, culminating in his choice to throw the baseball with legible cost.

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, such as "jaded wonder," and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent through peaks, with purposeful elision in the newspaper decoding taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "darkness that felt heavier than the sins" is voice-motivated and clear, propelling momentum to closure with no muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of neuro-procedure, time travel, and redemption feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details like the signed baseball.
