<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's claustrophobia and prudent adventure are consistently embodied, with internal conflict (fear vs. prudence) driving her choice to play the organ. Her final decision is earned by prior causality, and micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values. The cost is visible in her physical state post-climax, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (walls retreat, world awakens) and felt cost (gasping, sweat). Causal lens holds strong via because/therefore linkages (playing organ causes spatial rebellion). Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of claustrophobia shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (shadowed nexus, organ) constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details (brittle air, grinding stones) integrated into action. Spatial choreography is coherent during the mutiny, and the environment pressures Elara's decisions directly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: walls closing in force her to play, narrowing options. Cost is legible in her hammering heart and gasped breath, and the stake (survival/unlocking key) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of rebellion against stagnation emerges through particulars (music transfixing stones, fallow period) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (world awake, waiting for spring) that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (Elara's cautious, embodied perception). Voice modulates under stress (e.g., syntax tightens as walls close), and no head-hopping or elision issues obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("volatile spatial mutiny") is purposeful and clear, and sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the conflict.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of spatial mutiny and music-driven resolution feels inevitable, with risk-taking (organ mechanics) heightening stakes. Tropes are transformed through specific character choices and world logic.</comment>
