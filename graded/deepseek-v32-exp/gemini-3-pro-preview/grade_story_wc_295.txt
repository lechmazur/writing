<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to decode temple inscriptions is clear and drives the narrative; her interiority is concrete through actions like matching respiration to stars, and the final healing act is earned with visible cost. However, internal conflict is minimal, and emotional progression is somewhat tidy, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with cost as the burden is lifted and inscriptions decoded; the causal lens holds tightly from setup to resolution, and orientation is anchored early. The persistent constraint of variable stars shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the observatory and dream temple constraining choices; sensory details like the "breathing lung" star and nebulous void charge the final image, integrating environment into the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens, from entering the dream to witnessing and healing; cost is legible as the burden disperses. A minor deduction for the stake's abstraction before the dream sequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of shared burdens emerges organically through events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the transformed inscriptions; subtext in the healing act avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure is evident in lines like "pulsed violently," and elision (e.g., dream transition) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion without loops or muddle; figurative language like "celestial heartbeats" is consistent and purposeful, enhancing momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes lucid dreaming and astrophysics in a non-obvious way, with risk-taking in the dream realm heightening stakes; the integration feels inevitable and fresh, avoiding derivative patterns.</comment>
