<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to reclaim emotion is clear and drives the narrative, with embodied interiority and earned change through the vivification. The cost of numbness cracking is legible, though some abstraction in emotional description prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change and felt cost as numbness cracks, under a coherent causal lens. Orientation is anchored early, and the structure tightens meaningfully with Vane's erasure and Kael's success.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the floating dojo and jar constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early, escalation is driven by Kael's agency in the fight and vivification, with cost legible in the emotional shockwave. The conflict with Vane resolves swiftly but sufficiently for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of identity and rebirth emerges through events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via "silence and pulse." Subtext operates effectively without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with Kael's synthetic tone consistent. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven, and prose texture supports pressure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops or artifacts obscure clarity, and figurative language like "blade of pure silence" serves purpose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of clone custody and reality-rewriting, with turns earned through character choice. Emotional specificity and risk-taking in concept heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
