<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies, driving her to uncover the truth; her final choice to whisper the boy's name is earned by prior causality with visible cost, as the danger of shattering the spirit is dramatized. Interiority is concrete, with micro-choices under pressure, such as analyzing dreams and projecting consciousness. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; the resolution forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as grief lifts and truth is preserved, with cost legible in the candles flaring and the lightness replacing grief. Causal lens holds tightly from dream analysis to revelation, and orientation is clear early. The persistent constraint of potentially shattering spirits shapes tactics, and the ending reconfigures meaning without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly atmospheric with sensory details like "borrowed starlight," and the melted snow globe as a key object charges the final image by shifting meaning from lost innocence to courage. However, the environment does not deeply constrain choices, limiting the score; spatial choreography is coherent, and details are integrated through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens, as dream analysis tightens options and leads to the revelation of the boy's sacrifice. Cost is unmistakable in the risk of shattering the spirit and the emotional resolution. Stakes are clear and interweave internal and external conflict, with one meaningful deepening that reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the snow globe's transformed meaning, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to salvaging purity from tragedy. Subtext operates through implication, and the ending reweights prior material without moralizing. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality, and complexity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with a consistent perceptual signature reflecting Elara's profession and mindset; POV is stable and single, with no head-hopping. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and purposeful elision in dream analysis is taught and paid off. No dialogue, so not applicable for those bullets.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, enhancing atmosphere without muddle. Read-aloud test passes with elegance, and line-level craft supports closure without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of ghost whispering and dream analysis, transformed through specific details like the melted snow globe and emotional truth. Turns feel earned in hindsight, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The combination feels inevitable and indispensable, with bold choices that cohere.</comment>
