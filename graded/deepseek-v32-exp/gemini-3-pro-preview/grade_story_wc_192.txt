<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's internal conflict is embodied through concrete actions like white-knuckling the ring, and her final choice to drop it is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Elian serves as an effective catalyst without overshadowing her arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with Mara dropping the ring, creating a felt cost in the "terrifying open space." The accumulative/textural lens holds, and the ring's persistent constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ashen sanctuary constrains choice and charges the final image, with sensory details like "ash like winter snow" filtering through Mara's POV. The setting actively pressures her release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative lens, culminating in her choice to drop the ring with unmistakable cost. The stake between past and future tightens coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of release emerges through particulars like the ring and threshold, with subtext in dialogue ("you will have your hands back"). The ending reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice ("burnt cathedral"). Dialogue carries subtext, and elision like the bridges backstory is purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied rhythm, zero loops or scaffold. Lines like "starlight pricked the velvet sky" advance atmosphere without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of concepts like the shadow keeper and burnt sanctuary feels inevitable. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
