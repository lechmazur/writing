<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his trade, with interiority shown through meticulous actions and peripheral focus. The final choice to harvest echoes is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the cavern's stripped spirit. However, internal conflict is minimal, and emotional depth relies on summary rather than sustained contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the harvest reconfigures meaning, with felt cost in the dead cavern. The accumulative lens holds, driven by Elias's agency. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The marble cavern constrains choices (e.g., reflection angles guide sound mapping) and charges the final image. Sensory details are vivid and selective, filtered through Elias's POV. The setting is indispensable, acting as a micro-setting that pressures tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving echoes) is signaled early; escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the accumulative lens, culminating in the harvest with visible cost. One meaningful tightening (the timer's activation) forecloses options, though no major reversals occur.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of storing wonder against chaos emerges through particulars like the timer and cavern, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of contained echoes, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled under pressure. Elision (e.g., peripheral focus) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping, though diction is occasionally elevated but consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and supports peak beats. Minor overwriting exists but does not obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes nostalgia and machinery in a non-obvious way, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity in details (e.g., broken timer) anchors originality.</comment>
