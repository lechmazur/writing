<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bel-ibni's parsimony and devotion are consistently embodied through actions like extinguishing torches and the ritual, with micro-choices under pressure revealing his hierarchy of values. However, internal conflict is minimal, and the final nod of satisfaction, while earned, lacks deeper contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as the covenant seals knowledge, under a causal drive lens that holds from inciting incident to ritual completion. Orientation is clear early, and the final image of the darkened observatory reconfigures stakes with felt conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like blue-glazed brick and brass gears, filtering through Bel-ibni's POV. The observatory as micro-setting constrains the ritual choice and charges the final image, integrating environment with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes of preserving knowledge escalate under causal lens through Bel-ibni's agency in the ritual, narrowing options with cost legible in the tile's transformation. One meaningful tightening occurs, though pressure could be more visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of science versus superstition emerges through events like the ritual using logic, with subtext in encrypted devotion. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though ambiguity is slight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "viewed waste as a moral failing," and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; prose reflects Bel-ibni's analytical mind consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "reality peeled back like parchment" is coherent and purposeful, enhancing clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of historical Babylon with scientific ritual feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like the magic square. Risk-taking in blending logic and mysticism heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
