<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and rooted in his trade, with embodied emotion (burning lungs) and micro-choices under pressure (grounding boots, synchronized breathing). However, lacking deep internal contradiction or contradictory impulses in scene limits the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (lungs burning, risk of trapping), and the causal lens holds tightly. The persistent constraint of being grounded shapes tactics, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (boots in mud, frost binding) and charges the final image (orchard transformed to glass). Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, with tone consistent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Silas's agency under the causal lens, with cost legible (burning lungs, ethereal pull). The stake is signaled early and tightens through the ritual, foreclosing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of erasing boundaries emerges from events and images, not statement, with the final image offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext is woven through the ritual and transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (mirror maker's bias) and rhythmic control. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent, though slightly dense in peaks, without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mirror making, dream capture, and alchemy feels inevitable. Risk-taking in style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise is transformed through specific details.</comment>
