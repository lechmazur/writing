<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion like trembling hands and steady voice. Her final choice to petition the storm is earned by prior decoding, and her idealistic map librarian role anchors her actions. Contradictory impulses of nervous confidence are shown in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with cost (tears and lingering dread), and the causal lens holds tightly from decoding to ship materialization. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of the storm shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (slick console, moss) and charges the final image with the ship's appearance. Sensory details like ozone taste and spongey dread are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (proving Silas's discovery) escalate through Elara's agency under the causal lens, with cost legible in her tears. The petition narrows options and reweights the outcome, though the cost is emotional rather than severe.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of legacy and geography as promise emerges through particulars like coded stanzas, with a resonant, non-literal answer in the ship's return. Subtext operates in the ritual and storm sovereignty without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with perceptual signature in Elara's biased noticing (e.g., moss, condensation). The question dialogue is goal-driven, and elision in codes is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "bruised, swollen flesh" is coherent and voice-motivated, though minor overwriting exists in dense descriptions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of reversible exile, coded stanzas, and weather manipulation feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the ritual premise. Specificity in elements like the copper nail heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
