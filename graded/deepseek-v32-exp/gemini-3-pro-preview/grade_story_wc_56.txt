<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His final decision to lower the evidence back is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the "burden of his profession." However, internal contradictory impulses are not deeply explored, limiting the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Elias confirms the truth and inverts history, a decisive change under the causal lens. The radio silence and sunrise create a tight deadline, and orientation is clear early. The sundial and hull plate provide persistent constraints that shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "wet iron" mist and the canal pressuring choices. The environment charges the final image as the sun crests, and micro-setting elements like the winch and sundial constrain actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elias's agency, driven by the radio silence deadline and the physical salvage. Cost is legible when he lowers the evidence, foreclosing options with felt weight. The dominant stake of uncovering truth tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus lies emerges naturally through events and images, not statement. The ending reweights prior material without moralizing, offering a resonant answer through the sundial's confirmation and the inverted history.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, filtered through Elias's professional bias. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., radio silence) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures and clear propulsion. No loops or artifacts obscure causality; figurative language like "cable hummed, tight as a violin string" enhances without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Concept is fresh, synthesizing historical investigation with personal quest. Specific details like the sundial and radio silence create inevitability, and risk-taking in the quiet ending heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
