<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and rooted in embodied pain; his final choice to remain is earned through the discovery, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a hierarchy of values. The nerve regeneration agony is concretely rendered, and his endurance forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (pain confirming life); the accumulative lens holds, reinforced by the bolt's reweighting of silence. Orientation is clear early, and the spiral staircase discovery drives causality without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress constrains choice via the staircase and alcove, charging the final image; sensory details (freezing draft, blue stone) are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elian's POV to mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elian's agency under the accumulative lens, with the bolt discovery deepening stakes; cost is legible in his decision to endure pain and remain, foreclosing escape with a visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the bolt and silence concept without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to safety's cost, with subtext in the "contaminant" role reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature; prose rhythm modulates under pressure, and elision (e.g., the fortress's history) is taught and paid off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high density and varied rhythm without artifacts; figurative language ("molten glass") is coherent and purposeful, with no loops or scaffold obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of silence and safety tropes through specific details; the bolt as a mundane relic transforms familiarity, and risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
