<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's resilient positivity is concretely embodied and compels higher-stakes choices, such as radioing reality, with interiority shown through specific actions like scrubbing with fervor. Her motivation roots in consistent traits, and the final choice to fill the hourglass is earned by prior causality, though minor lack of internal contradiction limits peak score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change and cost (e.g., "deck lurched violently" as gravity reasserts), under a causal lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the hourglass's transformation provides a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting vividly pressures choices, such as the grotto's starlight guiding radio adjustments, and charges the final image with neon streaks. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, reflecting POV bias without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens, with radio action tightening stakes and cost legible in the ship's violent re-entry. Dominant stake of returning home is signaled early and deepens through her choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of hope and time emerges through events like the hourglass materializing sand, offering a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in images, though minor reliance on symbol over character complexity slightly limits resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with perceptual signature in rhythmic prose (e.g., "clocks run sideways"). Elision, like time mechanics, is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no major artifacts; figurative language serves pressure, though minor overwriting in phrases like "whisper ancient secrets" slightly reduces peak clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Concept of a vanishing ferry is freshly synthesized with specific details, and risk-taking in nonlinear time heightens stakes. The hourglass reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight, supporting originality.</comment>
