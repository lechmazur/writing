<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's reticent yet observant nature is embodied through concrete actions, such as cataloging Thomas's distress and choosing to intervene with the sea glass. His motivation to "bottle the feeling of safety" drives the climactic choice, earned by prior causality. Thomas's hollow eyes and trembling hands show embodied emotion under pressure, with the final renunciation of terror feeling credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the sea glass balances the cairn, shifting the message from distress to endurance with visible cost in Thomas's shuddering breath. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through atmospheric density. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the haunted setting persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lantern room functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice, its "heavy shadows" pressing against the glass to pressure Thomas. Sensory details like "metal ringing out like a tolling bell" are selective and purposeful. The stone cairn and sea glass charge the final image, reweighting the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens occurs through density increase: the lamp's failure intensifies Thomas's psychological crisis, compelling Elias's agency to place the sea glass. The cost is legible in Thomas's evaporated terror, and the dominant stake (psychological stability) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the stone cairns and sea glass, offering a resonant, non-literal answer about silent communication and endurance. Subtext operates in gestures (Elias's silent actions) and the final image reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Elias, with a distinct perceptual signature ("cataloging the smallest shifts in human erosion"). Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in phrases like "luminescent ache," and any elision (e.g., the sea glass's origin) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "suffocating blindness" is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the match strike and climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes lighthouse isolation with silent stone messages, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The sea glass transformation from junk to jewel embodies a fresh, non-obvious angle.</comment>
