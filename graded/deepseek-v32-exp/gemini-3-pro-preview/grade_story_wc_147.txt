<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority (e.g., "lungs burned," "trembling fingers") and contradictory impulses (panic vs. discipline) driving her earned stasis. The final choice to sacrifice herself is rooted in prior causality and visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elara becomes part of the signal, with felt cost (her death) under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and the oxygen constraint persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices (e.g., oxygen depletion, console invasion), constraining actions and charging the final image. Sensory details (bioluminescent algae, crushing weight) are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (signal vs. survival) escalate through protagonist agency under causal lens, with cost (hypoxia, death) unmistakable on the page. The oxygen clock and console repair meaningfully tighten options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of preservation and sacrifice emerges through particulars without moralizing, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer (becoming part of the signal). Subtext operates in imagery and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is immersive and consistent, with purposeful compression (e.g., psychic flashes) taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful (e.g., "tomb of eternal twilight"), and syntax varies with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes psychic residue and underwater setting with originality, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
