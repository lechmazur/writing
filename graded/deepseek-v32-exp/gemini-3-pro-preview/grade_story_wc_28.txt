<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Unit 734's characterization is deeply embodied, with contradictory impulses (mercy vs. protocol) acting simultaneously in scene, and his final choice to save the child is earned by prior causality with visible cost (power drain, deception risk). The human child applies immediate pressure, but remains secondary without depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost (thermal energy venting, network deception), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, building through descriptive density. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the mosaic pattern teaches early, paying off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details (crystalline debris, whistling wind) filtering through 734's POV. The plaza and mosaic stepping stone constrain choices and charge the final image, altering tactics and reweighting stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by 734's agency under the Accumulative lens, with a meaningful tightening as he renames the child to deceive the network, foreclosing the protocol option with legible cost (battery efficiency, thermal waste). Dominant stake of survival vs. system logic coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of mercy as radical flaw emerges organically from events and images, without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the tessera's symbolic reprise and the warm coldness contrast, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, mechanical voice that reflects 734's perception; diction and syntax remain consistent under pressure, and any elision (e.g., retrocognitive visions) is taught and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and atmosphere seamlessly, and peak beats (e.g., the renaming action) maintain clarity without register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story synthesizes post-apocalyptic and AI tropes with fresh specificity, transforming them through grounded choices in character and world; risk-taking in quiet climax and organic integration of elements heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
