<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistently drives her actions; her interiority is concretely embodied in the struggle with the regret knot, and her final choice to use the lamp feels earned under pressure, with visible cost in her exhaustion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elara successfully calcifies the regret, with cost legible in her misty breath and the return to waiting; the accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, building density to a satisfying end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The bronze grotto and starlight setting is vividly described and essential, constraining Elara's choices (e.g., the ceiling fissure for alignment) and charging the final image with atmospheric pressure that deepens the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency in aligning the lamp, driven by the accumulative lens; the cost is unmistakable in the hardening of grief and her relieved exhale, demonstrating a meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the transformation of emotion into tangible objects, with subtext in imagery like "whalebone reverie"; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and evocative, with a distinct poetic voice that reflects Elara's perception; no head-hopping, and elision (e.g., the lamp's mechanics) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density, though occasionally bordering on overwrought (e.g., "shingled hush" layers); no major artifacts harm clarity or closure, and propulsion remains strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of fractal weaving emotions is fresh and well-integrated, with risks in poetic abstraction paying off through specific, inevitable turns; the synthesis feels organic and memorable.</comment>
