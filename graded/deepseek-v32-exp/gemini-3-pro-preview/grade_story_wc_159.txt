<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion like "trembling fingers" and "foxglove regret." His micro-choices under pressure, such as humming to mend the bamboo, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final endurance is earned with visible cost in his loneliness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in Elian's isolation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through descriptive density. Orientation is clear early, and the bamboo mending drives a meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice, as the library's atmosphere requires acoustic resonance. The wind chime and orchids charge the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Elian's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving names) escalates through Elian's agency in mending the chime. Cost is legible in his effort and emotional weight. Under the Accumulative lens, density increase reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory and preservation emerges through concrete images like the glass orchids. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the possibility of names reaching others. No moralizing; subtext is rich.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with poetic diction like "cathedral of iridescent stone." Perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., the song's echo) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "foxglove regret" is coherent and voice-motivated. Minor overwriting does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, with glass orchids and acoustic preservation. Emotional truth in loneliness elevates stakes. Synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking in lyric mode heightens coherence.</comment>
