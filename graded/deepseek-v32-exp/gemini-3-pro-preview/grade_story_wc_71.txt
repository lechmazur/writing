<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies, driving the experiment; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, and his final realization is earned through the root's placement and the drunk's comment. Micro-choices under pressure reveal his values, and the change is credible with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the dawn's heaviness; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory buildup. Orientation is clear early, and causality flows from root discovery to experiment to insight, with no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details filtering through POV; the bay and house constrain choices, and the orris root as micro-setting charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early and escalate through Elias's agency under the Accumulative lens; the placement of the root forces a tightening, and cost is unmistakable in the hushed blaze and recognition of decay. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the root and silence, offering a resonant non-literal answer through contradiction. Subtext operates in the drunk's comment and root's symbolism, with no moralizing; the ending reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a perceptual signature for noticing decay; diction and rhythm control heighten pressure, and the drunk's dialogue is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or register shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm with no loops or overwriting; figurative language is purposeful and coherent, and sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative build. Closure image is sharp and undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is original with a fresh angle on silence and life; specific details like the orris root and shard of hush create an inevitable synthesis. Risk-taking in lyrical design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional truth avoids templates.</comment>
