<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with embodied emotion like "trembling fingers" and "haunted euphoria" showing internal conflict. Micro-choices under pressure, such as cleaning the locket rim and diverting seawater, reveal her values and cost. The final renunciation (dropping the locket) is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in "the heavy feeling of the moment" and Elara's transformed identity. Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through descriptive layers to the ritual's success. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and proximate causes drive a coherent, inevitable arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The blooming jetty constrains choice and charges the final image, with sensory details like "salt and heavy pollen" woven into action. The pier's structure enables the ritual (e.g., depression in wood for pooling), and the environment evolves with the magic, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving small moments) escalates through Elara's agency in the ritual steps, under the Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable in the "wave of haunted euphoria" and the physical forfeiture of the locket, narrowing options and reweighting emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from the covenant's regeneration, offering a non-literal answer to memory and loss through the final image of anchored laughter. Subtext operates in gestures like closing the empty locket, resisting moralizing and embracing complexity with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "walnut-ink archivist" filtering observation. Poetic syntax and rhythm control heighten pressure without head-hopping; elision (e.g., the man's identity) is taught and paid off in emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "ghost passing through her ribs" is coherent and voice-motivated, accelerating with scene needs. Closure image remains clear and uncluttered by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of archivist magic and emotional preservation feels inevitable, with specific details (e.g., distilled husks, proximate causes) avoiding tropes. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the core premise transforms familiar themes of grief.</comment>
