<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's operative gentleness is embodied and constrains his actions, while the warlords' grief reveals depth under pressure. Their admissions of lost children are earned micro-choices that scale to the closure cost. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains concrete and contradictory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly; the ritual directly causes the treaty signing. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost in the warlords' trembling hands and transferred sorrow. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the celestial event tightens options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ancient terrace and twin moons constrain the negotiation by silencing weapons, charging the final violet light. Sensory details like night-blooming jasmine and cordite are filtered through POV. The setting actively pressures choices and mirrors internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of peace escalates through the ritual's demand for names, narrowing options under celestial timeframe. Agency is clear in Kaelen's orchestration and the warlords' admissions. Cost is legible in their grief and the binding of peace to graves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of redemption through loss emerges organically from the ritual and names, not statement. The ending reconceptualizes peace as a burden carried by memory, with no moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and tears.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; Kaelen's voice is operatively gentle yet decisive. Prose rhythm varies with pressure, and dialogue carries subtext. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled with vivid imagery; no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language like "dragging their long shadows like wounded beasts" enhances without muddle. Sentence openings vary, and closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise of a forever war negotiator using ritual grief is fresh and specific. The ebony clipboard and celestial event are synthesized uniquely. Risks in tone and structure heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
