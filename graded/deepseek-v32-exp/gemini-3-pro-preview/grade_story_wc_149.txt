<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Julian's motivation is clear and desperate, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The ghost bride's debt repayment is consistent, and the final mournful elation earns the resolution with visible cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; internal conflict is dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change: Julian is cured but loses his guardian, with felt cost in "mournful elation." Causal lens holds strong from entry to transaction. Orientation is clear early, and the bead constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices: the greenhouse's venomous flora constrains navigation, and the environment charges the final image as it settles into slumber. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Julian's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Julian's life) escalates through his agency with the bead, leading to the transaction where cost is legible in his emotional aftermath. Under causal lens, pressure tightens meaningfully with no coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of debt and sacrifice emerges through events and images, with subtext in the ghost bride's silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in "mournful elation," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and third-person limited to Julian, with a distinct perceptual signature in descriptive, rhythmic prose. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural. Elision in ghost bride's manifestations is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language like "lovingly venomous" is consistent and vivid, and syntax varies naturally under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes alchemical botany and spectral debt with originality, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Emotional specificity in Julian's complex reaction elevates stakes without gimmickry, and the concept is fully committed.</comment>
