<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with embodied interiority shown through rhythmic tapping and rebellious actions. His final choice to trade sanity for the dream is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the closure. Contradictory impulses (passive appearance vs. active sabotage) act in scene, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (sanity lost for eternal dream), under a causal drive lens that holds throughout. Orientation is anchored early, and the persistent constraint of drumming shapes tactics. Cost is legible in "purchased with his sanity" and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The Sound Wave Garden constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details like "low hum bloom into hyacinth" and colors shifting to violet. Setting is integrated into action, reflecting Kael's priorities and enabling his goal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency—drumming intensifies, garden reacts, machinery resists—leading to a cost legible in his sacrificed sanity. Dominant stake (shared dream) tightens through his actions under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of love and sacrifice emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in drumming as rebellion. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer in the "sorrowful beauty" of the dream, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic prose that mirrors tapping. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is selective and character-specific, with elision taught and paid off in the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with purposeful figurative language like "auroral sorrow" and no loops or scaffold issues. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, supporting pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of Sound Wave Garden and entangled memories, transforming tropes through specific choices. Risk-taking in lyrical conceptual story heightens stakes, feeling inevitable in hindsight with no gimmickry.</comment>
