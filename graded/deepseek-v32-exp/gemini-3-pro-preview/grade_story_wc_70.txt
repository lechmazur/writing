<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Silas's involuntary truthfulness and desire to preserve wonder are consistently embodied, driving key choices; Kael's desperation is functional but slightly one-dimensional, though his defeat lands with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves a resonant reconfiguration as Kael accepts the permanent failure and sees beauty, with cost legible in his whispered "yes"; causal lens holds tightly from drone failure to reveal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (e.g., tower defines Silas's role) and charges the final image with "amber light"; sensory details like "bruised apricot" sky are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Silas's agency under the causal lens, from riddle imposition to reveal, foreclosing restart options with visible cost in Kael's defeat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wonder vs. efficiency emerges through particulars like stars visible after drones fail; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct poetic voice ("heavy nectar dusk"); dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "bruised apricot" is coherent and enhances clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise of drone beehive failure and truth compulsion offers a fresh synthesis; turns feel earned through character choices, though Kael's arc is somewhat conventional.</comment>
