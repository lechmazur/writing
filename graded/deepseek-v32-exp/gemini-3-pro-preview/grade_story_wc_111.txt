<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; his pragmatic stubbornness drives key choices, and the final action is earned with visible cost. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion shown through ritualistic movements. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws complicate choices credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (leaf stiffening, gauge stuttering) under a causal lens, cost legible in the sub-prefect's frustration. Orientation is clear early; the drive lens holds without ambiguity, and the marble's use shapes tactics persistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the garden maze constraining choices (light angles) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered; atmosphere supports theme without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elian's agency under the causal lens, from dismissal to ritual success; cost is legible in the leaf's renewal and sub-prefect's confusion. Dominant stake (care vs. luck) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on utility in brokenness. Subtext operates in gesture and implication; no moralizing, with complexity embraced through the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature; dialogue is natural and goal-driven. Rhythm and diction control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent; sentences advance story and atmosphere seamlessly, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of measurable luck and botanical care, transformed through specific choices. Risk-taking in concept and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional truth feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
