<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Seven's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and internal conflict shown through his choice to use the Box of Childhood Fears. His final decision to incinerate the past is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in leaving the farm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost as Seven escapes the dome, incinerating the past. The causal lens holds tightly from geomagnetic reversal to compression and propulsion, with orientation anchored early and no coherence breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The glass-domed desert rose farm and maintenance shed are vivid, sensory-rich settings that pressure choices and charge the final image. The dome's hermetic nature and its shattering are integral to the climax and Seven's escape.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate coherently under the causal lens, driven by Seven's agency to resolve inner static via the box, culminating in a propulsion release with unmistakable cost—shattering the dome and foregoing nostalgia.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of using pain to move forward emerges implicitly from events, with subtext in the box's use and a resonant, non-literal final image of incinerating the past without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic, technical diction reflecting Seven's perception. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in compression, though minor ornate moments exist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and clear propulsion. No loops or scaffold; figurative language like "psychic hurricane" is purposeful and coherent, though slightly intense in peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh, synthesizing AI nostalgia with geomagnetic reversal and childhood fears, transformed through specific choices. Risk-taking in resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
