<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "discover what ceilings hide" is clear and drives the narrative; his ghost-seeing ability and occupational skills are integrated into micro-choices under pressure, such as analyzing dust patterns, and the final renunciation (ghosts fading) is earned with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and embodied, though internal conflict is minimal but sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with cost: the lift descends, ghosts fade, and the building shifts, reconfiguring the stakes under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and causality holds from investigation to resolution, with the mainspring barrel jam creating a persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices: the ticket office's grime, cracks, and dust patterns constrain Elias's actions, and the environment charges the final image of the descending ceiling. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the causal lens: his analysis of dust leads to finding and removing the jam, tightening options with cost (ghosts intensifying, then fading). Dominant stake (uncovering hidden truth) deepens through one meaningful turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of broken illusions and hidden truths emerges through particulars like cracks and the frozen mechanism, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in imagery and ghostly presence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is consistent and reflects Elias's professional mindset, with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats like the mechanism engagement. Sentences advance story and atmosphere concisely.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes ghost-seeing technician and abandoned circus with originality; turns feel earned and specific, risking bold imagery (e.g., weightless burden) that heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation of tropes is grounded.</comment>
