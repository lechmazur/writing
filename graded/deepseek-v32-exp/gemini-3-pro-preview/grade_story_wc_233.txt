<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Isolde's disenchantment and motivation are vividly embodied through micro-choices under pressure, such as ignoring numbness to climb, and her final transformation to guardian is earned with visible cost ("the heat searing away her disenchantment"). Valerius provides secondary pressure, but Isolde's interiority remains specific and driven without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (Isolde becoming guardian) under a hybrid causal-accumulative lens, cost legible in the searing heat and foreclosed path. Orientation is clear early, and the climb-to-grotto progression tightens coherently without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (e.g., climb limits, grotto danger) and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, like the "cobalt grotto" humming and the ember grotto's heat defying cold, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Isolde's agency under the hybrid lens, from climb to ember grotto reach, with cost unmistakable in her failed strength and searing disenchantment. Stakes (survival, meaning) tighten meaningfully without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of stewardship emerges through particulars like bleeding starlight and fireflies, with subtext in imagery; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the guardian role.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "lacy menace" filtering perception), rhythmic control under pressure, and natural dialogue; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts; metaphors like "bleeding starlight" are purposeful and clear, though slightly dense in peaks, but closure remains unscathed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in non-obvious synthesis (e.g., bleeding starlight with ember grotto), transforming tropes through specific stakes; risk-taking in concept heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
