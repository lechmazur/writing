<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kellen's motivation is clear and rooted in his role, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., adjusting knobs and layering tracks) revealing his values. Elias's transformation is earned, but Kellen's interiority lacks depth in peak beats, with some diagnostic language ("illuminate hidden assumptions") that slightly abstracts his struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Elias is freed, and the causal lens holds tightly from Kellen's actions to the resolution. The cost is legible in Elias's gasp and the paint's transformation, with the setting's pressure consistently shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly anchored with sensory details (ozone taste, vibrating grating) that constrain choices; the palette as a micro-setting charges the final image by losing its power, reinforcing the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early, and escalation is driven by Kellen's agency under the causal lens, with cost visible in Elias's softening posture and the paint greying. One meaningful tightening occurs through the sonic assault, though the entity's adaptation is minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions and images (e.g., silence sculpting voids), with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the palette's transformation. Avoids moralizing, but the concept of "unraveled stillness" is slightly overt in its statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature biased toward sound and technology. Rhetorical devices are integrated without head-hopping, and elision (e.g., the entity's nature) is taught and paid off in the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Minor register drift in "plumb the metaphysical depths" feels slightly academic but does not harm peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of exorcism tropes with sound and logic, transformed through specific details like the loop pedal and Vantablack. Risk-taking in method heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
