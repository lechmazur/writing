<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sylas's motivation to translate texture into sound is clear and intensifies under pressure, driving key choices like using the cursed diamond. His interiority is concrete through embodied actions (e.g., copper veins glowing), and the final cost (voice loss) is earned with visible sacrifice. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; micro-choices under pressure reveal his values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Sylas loses his voice but the wind now carries tactile memory, with cost legible in the "dry, silent rattle." Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory patterns. Orientation is clear early, and the cursed diamond's constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting (bone towers, canyon) pressures choices and charges the final image; the diamond's flaw and bird patterns constrain tactics. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered (e.g., "calcified perimeter"), with coherent spatial choreography. No generic placeholder; environment is indispensable to the arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving texture) escalates under Accumulative lens through density increase (bird flock, vocalization). Sylas's agency drives the harness action, leading to a cost (voice loss) that is unmistakable on-page. No coincidence; pressure tightens meaningfully with visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (sacrifice for preservation beyond language) emerges through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the wind rasping intent, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "refracted the image of the birds"). Voice is poetic and controlled under pressure, with rhythmic syntax. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., diamond's curse) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated (e.g., "skeletal fingers"), though minor density in peak beats prevents a higher score. Clarity and propulsion remain strong, with no artifacts harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is a non-obvious synthesis of dystopian storytelling and sensory translation, transformed through specific details (copper veins, cursed diamond). Risk-taking in structure and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth arises from particulars, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
