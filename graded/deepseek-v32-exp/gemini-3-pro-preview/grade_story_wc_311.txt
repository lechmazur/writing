<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's grief is embodied and drives his actions; his motivation to transform fear into tangible objects is clear and intensifies under pressure. The final choice to complete the map is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the lightening of his chest. Contradictory impulses of reaper duty and personal grief act in scene, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Silas completes the map, stripping fears of power; cost is legible in the "sigh" and emotional relief. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with the process building to a decisive change. Orientation is clear early, and no causality breaks occur.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains choices (e.g., adjusting gears, using light) and charges the final image with the blank atlas page. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Silas's POV. The environment actively shapes tactics, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Silas's agency under the accumulative lens, as each crystallization deepens the stake of overcoming grief. Cost is unmistakable in the lightening of his chest and the transformation of fears. One meaningful tightening occurs, foreclosing the path of haunting dread.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief and transformation emerges through concrete images and actions, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the glittering sculptures. Subtext operates in whispers and the process, avoiding moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from particulars like the recordings and map.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature in Silas's poetic observation. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision (e.g., echoes) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent and specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, supporting the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes reaper mythology with grief work in a non-obvious way, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the quiet, transformative resolution heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details like the wax cylinders and prism array anchor originality.</comment>
