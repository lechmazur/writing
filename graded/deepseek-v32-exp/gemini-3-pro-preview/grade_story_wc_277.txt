<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority concrete and emotions embodied. Her final choice to intervene with logic is earned by prior causality, though she lacks significant contradictory impulses or flaws, keeping her slightly too competent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change as the threat dissipates, cost legible in the shifted orbit of regret and restored silence. Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages from investigation to refutation. Orientation is clear early, and constraints like the pen and ledgers shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly described with sensory details, and the rosewood pen nib as a micro-setting constrains choice by enabling the proof. The observatory enhances atmosphere but doesn't directly pressure choices, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Eleanor's agency under the causal lens, with stakes clearly signaled and cost legible in her intellectual effort. The proof by contradiction tightens options meaningfully, though the conflict resolves without lasting external consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and the orbits of regret metaphor, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, but the concept is occasionally explicit, slightly reducing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—elegant and precise—reflecting Eleanor's character. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and any elision is taught and paid off in closure. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density, varied rhythm, and clarity with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, and sentence-level propulsion supports the causal drive without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story synthesizes elements with originality, using proof by contradiction and orbits of regret in a non-obvious way that feels inevitable. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the perspective is memorable.</comment>
