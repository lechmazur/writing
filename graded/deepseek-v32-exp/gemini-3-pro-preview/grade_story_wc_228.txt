<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elias's grief is embodied through specific micro-choices like painting the shell, and his final release is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost legible in the shell's release reconfiguring grief. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The coastal cave and tidal pool constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory detail purposeful and integrated into action. Micro-setting (seashell, pool) actively shapes the ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the Accumulative lens, with the ritual deepening stakes and cost unmistakable in the release. Dominant internal stake is tightly braided with closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of temporary eternity emerges through particulars like the painted shell, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Prose reflects Elias's mind, and any elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and propulsion with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, and syntax varies naturally to support emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Concept of temporary eternity is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet plot heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and specificity anchors universals.</comment>
