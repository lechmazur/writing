<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, with embodied emotions (trembling during memory) and micro-choices (grounding herself) revealing values. Interiority is concrete, and the final act of creating the lantern is earned by prior causality. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost (memory of inferno charges the gem's glow), under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) is legible. The persistent constraint of fear shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective (damp grotto, limestone walls), with sensory details that pressure choices (grotto as refuge, sea glass as tool). The environment constrains action and charges the final image, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safe light vs. fire fear) escalates through memory resurfacing, driven by Elara's agency in polishing and overcoming panic. Cost is unmistakable in the emotional weight, and escalation coheres under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images and actions (sea glass transformation, gem glow) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to trauma and light, reweighting prior material with subtext in the memory and final beacon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature reflective of Elara's star-watcher identity. Rhythm and diction control heighten pressure without obscurity, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, and sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of trauma, craft, and celestial imagery feels inevitable, with specific details (sea glass, pearl of stillness) transforming familiar tropes. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
