<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and rooted in his esoteric skill, with interiority shown through embodied perception (e.g., "leathered lines of his face"). His final sensory displacement is earned by prior causality, and the cost of decades trapped is felt. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (sensory displacement) with cost legible in the "afterimage of the route." Accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory patterns. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight from appraisal to throw to revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the bone canyon and dust constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "calcified ribs," "resonant clack"). Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Silas's agency under the accumulative lens: appraising birds leads to the throw, which builds sound to reveal the exit. Cost is legible in his trapped past and newfound path. One meaningful tightening forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars of sound, memory, and time, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via sensory displacement. Subtext operates in the wandering pulse and weathered resolve. No moralizing or abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature (e.g., "auditory awareness expanded outward"). Rhythm and diction control under pressure, and any elision (e.g., sound projection) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful (e.g., "coiled his body with the tension of a tightly wound spring"). No clarity issues in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept is a fresh synthesis of esoteric skill and acoustic navigation, transformed through specific details. Risk-taking in premise heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth and inevitability in hindsight.</comment>
