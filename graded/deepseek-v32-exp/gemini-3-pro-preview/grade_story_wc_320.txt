<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her professional role and personal philosophy ("find the beginning in every ending"), with micro-choices under pressure (discarding assumptions) that reveal her values. Interiority is concrete and embodied, such as the silence buzzing against her skin, avoiding stock phrasing. The final choice to capture the silence is earned by prior causality, with cost implied in the risky setting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the captured silence yields data representing cosmic rebirth, with cost legible in the creaking towers and volatile magic. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory density to a cadence shift. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lunar perigee constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices (e.g., wind groaning through girders, lunar static), with sensory detail filtered through POV (e.g., "hydraulic grease from her gloves"). The environment constrains the climax by forcing Elara to adapt, and the final image of the "mechanical graveyard" charges the closure with atmospheric weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing the nebula's frequency) escalates under the Accumulative lens through increased interference, leading to a meaningful tightening when Elara shifts to seeking silence. Protagonist agency drives the escalation, with cost felt in the risk and precision required. The closure reweights options by transforming the mission's outcome.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of beginnings in endings emerges organically through Elara's actions and the final data as a "recipe for the star nursery," without moralizing. Subtext operates in the "shard of hush" as a vibrant absence, offering a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature blending practical detail and poetic observation (e.g., "serenely electric"). Voice remains consistent under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., discarding assumptions) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated (e.g., "pregnant with potential"), and syntax accelerates with scene needs. Closure image is sharp, with clear propulsion and no artifacts obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The concept of capturing cosmic silence via a Hollywood star fragment is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific world logic and character choice, with risk-taking in the lyric-practical tone that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
