<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits of curiosity and non-conformity, driving his unauthorized mission. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like the cold gnawing and the sand grain's pain focusing his mind. Micro-choices under pressure, such as using the chemical strip and enduring the cold, reveal his values and earn the final capture. The final endurance and renunciation of comfort are earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), with the captured image symbolizing the loss of natural darkness amid industrial glare, and cost is legible in the "weight of the sand grain" and the "sterile glare." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building density through sensory details and timing mechanisms toward the final image. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of avoiding drones shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory details (e.g., "jagged ridge," "artificial sodium light," "biting frost") that pressure choices, such as the cold seeping through the suit and the summit enabling the photograph. The moonlit summit functions as micro-setting, constraining Elias's actions and charging the final image of the "stark, rugged beauty" lost to perpetual light. Proper-noun economy (Tycho basin) and spatial choreography are coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing the last true night) is signaled early and escalates under the Accumulative lens through density increases in timing pressure and environmental hazards. Elias's agency drives escalation via actions like using the chemical strip and enduring pain, culminating in a meaningful tightening as the light arrives. Cost is unmistakable in the "weight of the sand grain" and the replacement of natural dawn with "harsh, sterile glare."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of loss and industrialization emerges implicitly through events and images, such as the orbital mirrors "banishing the shadows" and the photograph as a "permanent memory of the dark." Subtext operates in Elias's primitive methods contrasting with advanced society. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image, reweighting prior material without moralizing, and embracing complexity with melancholy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in Elias's professional yet poetic observations (e.g., "razor-thin line of diamond-white light"). Voice is controlled and rhythmic, modulating with pressure, such as the "dawning hush" passage. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (e.g., avoiding radar) is taught and pays off in the climax. Diction remains within the character's lexicon, enhancing texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere (e.g., "The horizon ignited."). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; clarity and concision prevail even in peak beats. Syntax supports propulsion, such as the short, sharp description of the light slicing across the crater. Read-aloud ear test passes with natural flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on environmental loss, synthesized through specific details like the chemical timing and sand grain. Tropes are transformed via grounded choices in character and world, with risk-taking in the quiet, lyrical closure. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight, and emotional specificity avoids generic templates, supported by authentic vision.</comment>
