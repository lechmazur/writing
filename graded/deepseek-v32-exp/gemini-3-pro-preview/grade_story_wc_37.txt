<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with concrete interiority shown through her fragmented memory. Her final action is earned by prior causality, though flaws could be more deeply contradictory. The cost of her mental scattering is felt at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—Elara collapses as the dawn unfurls—under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and structure is tight with one meaningful tightening. The mica window and weaving sequence create coherent causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the mica window enabling the climax. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, with the orchard charging the final image. Atmosphere supports theme without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency in weaving and swaddling the dawn, with cost legible in seared palms and mental focus. Under causal lens, pressure coheres to a decisive turn. Community resonance deepens stakes but is secondary.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from woven dawns and memory, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in community binding enriches complexity. Final image reweights prior material with enduring cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic compression reflecting Elara's scattered mind. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is strong. Rhythm controls pressure, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with varied rhythm and high information density. Minor overwriting in figurative language doesn't obscure clarity. No major artifacts; closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept of woven dawns is fresh and transformed through specific details like memory keeping. Synthesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking in structure heightening stakes. No derivative echoes.</comment>
