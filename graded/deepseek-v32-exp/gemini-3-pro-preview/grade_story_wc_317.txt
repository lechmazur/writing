<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his receptivity to innovation, driving his actions from seed nurturing to final insight. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like wrinkling his nose at the odor, and micro-choices under pressure reveal his values. The final decision to use the corpse flower is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction is slight, limiting higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Elias envisions a new escape room, reconfiguring his mental block into inspiration under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and the seed's growth escalates logically from his orthogonal methods. Cost is felt in his obsessive effort, but the positive outcome slightly mitigates emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like the brook's gurgle and storm-born silence, creating a cohesive atmosphere that mirrors internal states. However, the environment does not strongly constrain choices or charge the final image beyond mood, preventing a higher score despite its specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from mental block to biological revelation through Elias's agency, with cost legible in his hours of labor and the flower's ominous growth. Under the causal lens, one meaningful tightening occurs as the seed's development forces a new creative direction, though the conflict lacks deep internal friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of innovation through lateral thinking emerges organically from events, with the corpse flower serving as a non-literal answer to creative blocks. Subtext is implied in the seed's transformation, avoiding moralizing, but the concept lacks profound ambiguity, leaning on practical resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Elias's professional lexicon and rhythmic prose. No dialogue present, but internal voice remains coherent under pressure, with purposeful elision in flow states that supports narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits varied syntax and vivid imagery, such as "pressurized quietude," with high information density and no major artifacts. Rhythm accelerates with the climax, though minor scaffold phrases like "mental block" recur without full pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes escape room design with botany in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming tropes through specific character choices. Risk-taking in lateral thinking heightens stakes, but the concept stays within accessible innovation, lacking transformative boldness.</comment>
