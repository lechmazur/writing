<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; her practical soul and grief drive the action. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion like pressing thumbs into wood to transfer grief. The final choice to contain Silas's essence is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her relieved stance. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elara achieves rust-hued peace, transferring grief to the wood. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with patterns of memory and present action building to the final image. Cost is legible in the wood accepting the burden and her content solitude. Orientation is clear early with who, where, when anchored by ~120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful; the rain-beaded skylight loft and workbench constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, e.g., rain as ghost applause. Micro-setting (kettle, wood) alters tactics by imposing timeframe and serving as vessel. Environment subtly mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Elara's internal conflict with grief and transience. Escalation under Accumulative lens via density increase in crystallized time method, leading to realization about death. Agency drives the transfer of grief to wood, with cost legible in her ceased chest burden. One meaningful tightening is sufficient, foreclosing the path of drowning sorrow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from events: transience vs. preservation, grief as structural integrity. Subtext operates in actions like carving and kettle boiling. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing: "the beast does not hate the tamer... it simply is." Earned wisdom through specific struggle and concrete image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt; voice is distinct with practical, reflective texture. Perceptual signature is character-specific, e.g., noticing cage locks and wood grain. Rhythmic control under pressure, with elision taught and paid off in crystallized time. No head-hopping or register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clarity, with sentences advancing story, character, and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; figurative language like "crystallized time" is purposeful. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally, and syntax supports emotional beats without monotony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief and memory through specific details: circus widow, carving method. Tropes transformed via grounded character choices; perspective is memorable with haunting practicality. Risk-taking in internal process heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
