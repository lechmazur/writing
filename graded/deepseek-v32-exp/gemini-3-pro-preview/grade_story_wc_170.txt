<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot with methodical actions. The man's characterization is indirect but sufficient for the scope. However, the lack of deep interiority or contradictory impulses for Elara, and the light cost of the borrowed heartbeat, prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure is legible as a decisive change with the man standing up, and the causal lens holds with coherent linkages. The temporal constraint of the bells escalates pressure, but the cost of the borrowed heartbeat is underemphasized and not deeply felt, limiting impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like wet stone and lilac, and the prism parapet actively constrains Elara's choices by fracturing light. The terrace and bells charge the final image, creating a resonant atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled with the race against the bells, and escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens. The cost of the borrowed heartbeat is present but could be more visceral to heighten tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of redemption and possibility emerges organically through the mirage's transformation of the reflection, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext is woven through image and action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and limited to Elara, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on light and sound. The poetic voice remains consistent under pressure, and any elision is purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is elegant and dense, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and serves the narrative, and sentences advance story and atmosphere without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core premise of a mirage painter altering reflections is fresh and specific, with emotional truth grounded in character choices. The borrowed heartbeat concept adds ingenuity, and the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
