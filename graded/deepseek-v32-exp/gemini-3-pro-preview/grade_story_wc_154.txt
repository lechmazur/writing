<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, with embodied emotions like "tightness in his chest" and micro-choices under pressure. His final action of rewriting the message is earned by prior causality, showing contradictory impulses between his own pain and desire to heal. The cost is visible in his trembling hand and the atmospheric shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost, as Elias's rewriting reconfigures meaning from terror to embrace, underscored by the mist transforming from "suffocating barrier" to "blanket." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with details like the coral and cast charging the final image. Orientation is clear early, and the constraint of the cast shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the mist-clad atrium and cast as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the closure. Sensory details like "rough, calcified texture" of coral reflect POV bias. Atmosphere shifts coherently from clinical coldness to "lotus-hearted ache," supporting theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the Accumulative lens, as he decodes and rewrites the cast, narrowing options from fear to comfort. Cost is legible in his trembling hand and the reweighted stake of healing. Dominant stake of emotional transformation is signaled early and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transforming trauma emerges through particulars like the coral and cast, with subtext in the rewritten message. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the mist as "blanket," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Earned through specific struggle and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Elias's translator role, evident in "shrewdly innocent gaze" and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; voice is consistent and literary, with purposeful compression in peaks like the rewriting moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "coral’s intricate, maze-like ridges" is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere, with clear propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in the non-obvious synthesis of trauma, translation, and object-based healing, with specific details like brain coral and decrypting messages. Risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight, transforming familiar tropes.</comment>
