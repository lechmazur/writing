<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; her internal conflict is embodied in choices like trusting the tablet over senses, and the final renunciation of gravity is earned with visible cost ("crushing, beautiful burden").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (landing synchronizes with the ripple, fusing timelines); causal lens holds tightly via tablet-guided actions; orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (procedural generation shifts paths) and charges the final image (viaduct locks into permanence); sensory details are vivid and purposeful, reflecting urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (conquering self) escalate through agency (illogical turns driven by tablet); cost is legible in the loss of the tablet and acceptance of gravity, narrowing options under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of integration emerges through images (droplet/ripple, fractured timelines) without moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the fused entity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; poetic compression is taught and pays off at closure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high density and rhythmic control without loops or artifacts; figurative language is pattern-taught and supports closure; sentences advance momentum consistently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes procedural generation and fractured timelines with specificity; risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure feels inevitable.</comment>
