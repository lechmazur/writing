<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lirael's internal conflict is embodied and drives her choice to awaken Kael, with micro-choices like trembling fingers revealing cost. However, Kael's flatness slightly limits depth, though single-POV focus mitigates this. The final decision is earned by prior causality, but secondary character development is minimal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strong with clear orientation and closure: Kael's awakening reconfigures stakes, and the Council's threat imposes cost. The plot progresses through motivated ellipsis, and the ending lands with a decisive change that feels inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the cryo-chamber and snowy library constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "ice crystals bloomed" reflect POV bias, though some descriptions edge toward ornamentation without full integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes around truth vs. censorship escalate through Lirael's agency, culminating in a meaningful tightening with the awakening. Cost is legible in the Council's implied retaliation, but the escalation lacks multiple reversals, fitting the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of truth emerges through action and image, not statement, with subtext in gestures like the letter's handling. The ending reweights prior material without moralizing, though it leans slightly explicit in Lirael's dialogue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, and dialogue is natural and goal-driven. However, minor register drift occurs in phrases like "dizzying quiet," and Kael's voice lacks full distinction under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and density, with sentences advancing plot efficiently. Minor overwriting and repetitive stems (e.g., "dizzying quiet" reused) cause slight artifacts, but no loops muddle closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes cryogenics and rebellion with specificity, avoiding cliché through setting and stakes. While not groundbreaking, the execution feels organic, with risk in tone and structure heightening coherence.</comment>
