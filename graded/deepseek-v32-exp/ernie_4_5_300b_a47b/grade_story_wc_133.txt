<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marin's insomnia and wry earnestness are consistently embodied and drive her choices, with internal conflict shown in her hesitation before the exchange. The final renunciation of threshing meaning for growing it is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in her eased insomnia and transformed painting. Contradictory impulses act in scene, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly from Marin's search to the brooch exchange and painting transformation. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost on-page in the final image of the island as a bridge and her eased insomnia. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the brooch's persistent constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tidal island setting pressures choices through rain trails and debris, constraining Marin's discovery of the brooch and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, e.g., "salt-bleached cliffs" and "black mirror" pool, with the brooch functioning as a micro-setting that alters options.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (search for meaning) escalates under causal lens through Marin's agency: following rain, accepting the exchange, using the brooch. Cost is unmistakable in the forfeiture of her canvas and the transformative painting. One meaningful tightening forecloses her old path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the brooch and rain, culminating in a non-literal answer ("Meaning isn’t threshed. It’s grown") that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates through the stranger's sketches and the brooch's symbols, avoiding explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "brushes dipped in starlight," and voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in the exchange with the stranger, though minor register consistency holds it from 9+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, e.g., "silhouette frayed at the edges like a watercolor," though slight purple tinge in peaks prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-war decay, convergence concept, and artistic renewal feels inevitable in hindsight. The amber brooch and tidal island setting transform familiar tropes through specific, risk-taking choices that heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
