<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's reflective and peripherally focused nature is consistently embodied through micro-choices like using the mirror to reveal etchings, aligning with his motivation to restore wonder. However, the characterization lacks deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, preventing a higher score. His final action feels earned but without significant emotional cost or flaw complication.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the timer's activation and echo harvest, costing the end of the wounded season and storing wonder, under a coherent accumulative/textural lens. The persistent constraint of light angles shapes tactics, and orientation is clear early. Cost is legible in the quartz glowing and hum resonating, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The marble cavern vividly constrains choices through quartz veins and light angles, essential to reverse-engineering the timer. Sensory details like "damp stone and forgotten things" are selective and POV-filtered, integrating into action. The setting charges the closure with the pulsing light and harmonic hum, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes around storing wonder escalate through Elias's agency in mapping light shifts and reassembling the timer, under the accumulative lens. A meaningful tightening occurs when the timer clicks into place, foreclosing other paths with cost legible in the echo harvest. No major reversals, but pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of wonder versus reason emerges implicitly through the harvest concept and Elias's doubt about "reason's cellar," avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer with the timer storing echoes, reweighting prior material without statement. Subtext operates in images like the mirror warping, but lacks profound ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, as Elias's peripheral focus shapes noticing edges and angles. Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic prose like "the marble cavern hummed with the low thrum of trapped time." No head-hopping or dialogue, but elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "gears scattered like dead leaves" is purposeful and coherent. Minor overwriting in phrases like "frozen starlight" doesn't harm closure, and propulsion remains clear to the end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of harvesting echoes is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight, transforming tropes through specific world logic. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure reconfigures meaning. Specificity in details like the mirror and quartz veins anchors originality.</comment>
