<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lirael's softly deliberate nature is consistently shown through her cautious investigation and final decisive action, with interiority anchored in concrete details like the river stone's shift. Her motivation to understand the shadow unbound intensifies under pressure, compelling her to compare footage and utter the key word. The final choice to say "bloom" is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly from investigation to closure, with clear orientation early. Closure is a decisive change where the shadow's metamorphosis reconfigures hope, costing its prior form but allowing growth. The river stone and footage act as persistent constraints that shape tactics, and cost is legible in the shadow's transformation and library's renewal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The blooming library's petrified petals and glass dome create a vivid, magical atmosphere that pressures choices through the archives and stone. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtering through Lirael's sharp-eyed POV. The setting charges the final image as books rearrange, and the river stone constrains key actions across beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving hope escalates through Lirael's agency under the causal lens, from dismissal to active comparison of footage. The tightening forecloses options as the shadow demands definition, with cost unmistakable in its transformation and the library's renewal. No coincidence resolves; climax arises from her earned choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hope's metamorphosis emerges through events and images like the shadow's spiral and rearranged books, not direct statement. Subtext operates in the shadow's hunger for definition and Thalos's regret. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending poetic observation and deliberate action. Dialogue with Thalos feels natural and advances plot through subtext. Voice remains coherent under pressure, though minor convergence in elevated diction occurs at peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold obscuring causality. Figurative language like "veins of gold that pulsed like a heartbeat" is consistent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates toward closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes shareable dreams and a metaphysical shadow with originality, transformed through specific details like the river stone and video footage. Emotional truth anchors the concept, and risk-taking in poetic elements heightens stakes without gimmickry. The resolution feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
