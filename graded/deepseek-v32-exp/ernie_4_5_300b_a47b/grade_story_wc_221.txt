<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elio's motivation is clear and rooted in his exile, with embodied interiority and credible micro-choices under pressure. His final decision to trust the compass is earned by the glimpse and grandmother's message, with visible cost in the smudged ink and fading image. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as his plea to stay versus acceptance of movement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Elio's resolved confusion and the compass's guidance. The Hybrid lens holds, driven by causal links from the glimpse to realization. Orientation is clear early, and the time dilation constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The time dilation deck constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details like frosted glass and warping constellations. The compass rose functions as a micro-setting that alters tactics. Specificity is purposeful and filtered through Elio's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elio's agency under the Hybrid lens, from the glimpse to the grandmother's appearance, forcing a stance crystallization. Cost is legible in the loss of the grandmother and his altered perception. Dominant stake of confusion versus exploration tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as true north reweighted as a philosophical compass. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, through Elio's realization that "adriftness was a kind of freedom." Subtext operates in implication and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic yet controlled prose. Rhythmic variation supports pressure, and elision (e.g., the glimpse) is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, as in "constellations warp through the distortion field," and syntax varies naturally. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of time dilation and philosophical inquiry feels inevitable, with risk-taking in structure and theme heightening stakes. Specific details like the compass rose and meteorite ink transform tropes through grounded choices. Closure reconfigures prior material with ingenuity.</comment>
