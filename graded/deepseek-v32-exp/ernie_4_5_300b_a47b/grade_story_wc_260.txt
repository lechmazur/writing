<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., trembling hands while working on the tail). Her final renunciation of fear and guilt is earned by prior causality, and the cost of shedding layers is visible. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as clinging to gentleness while confronting vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in Lira's reclaimed balance. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pattern breaks in the tail's reconstruction charging the final image. Orientation is clear early, and the con's revelation tightens decisions without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The misty workshop and chameleon tail tip constrain choices and charge the closure, with sensory details (e.g., "cold glass," "starlight") filtered through Lira's POV. The tail as a micro-setting alters tactics and reinforces theme, avoiding ornamental description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the Accumulative lens, with the dominant stake (purpose vs. exploitation) deepening through her reconstruction act. Cost is legible in her shedding of layers, narrowing options with visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of fragility as strength emerges through particulars like the tail as a "map of survival," offering a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures (e.g., "shed layers") and the final image reweights prior material with resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature in lyrical prose ("mist curled like a ghost’s breath") and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, even in peak beats (e.g., "fragility felt less like a flaw"). Sentence rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the specific synthesis of wildlife handling and internal reconstruction, transforming tropes through grounded choices. Risk-taking in quiet narrative heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
