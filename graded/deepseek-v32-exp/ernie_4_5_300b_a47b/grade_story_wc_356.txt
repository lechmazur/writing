<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lira's ambition and patience are consistently embodied through sensory details and micro-choices; her shift from forcing growth to embracing stillness is earned by the dream revelation and journal reflections, with cost legible in jagged doodles and serene bloom.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the corpse flower's bloom reconfiguring village energy; causal drive holds from seed receipt to cultivation, anchored early in treetop village, and cost is felt in elders' admission and Lira's tempered ambition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (vines, lanterns, scents) create a rich atmosphere, but the setting primarily supports tone rather than constraining choices; the treetop village charges the final image but is replaceable in function.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes of serenity vs. chaos escalate through Lira's agency—doubts, elder warnings, dream insight—culminating in a cost-legible tightening as her patience forecloses rushing and enables the bloom.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom in stillness emerges organically from Lira's journey and doodle symbolism; the ending's non-literal answer ("chaos and serenity are kin") avoids moralizing, resonating through the bloom's harmony.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature focused on olfaction and texture; voice is consistently poetic, and elision (e.g., dream sequence) serves closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density, though minor register drift ("olfactorily sensitive") occurs; no loops or scaffolds obscure causality, and propulsion sustains through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes herbalist tropes with specific details (corpse flower, doodling) for inevitability; execution is grounded but lacks transformative risk, staying within conventional lyrical bounds.</comment>
