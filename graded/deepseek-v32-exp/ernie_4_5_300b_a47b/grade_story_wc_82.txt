<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and rooted in grief; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., trembling fingers). Final choice to confront the shadow is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the luminous torment scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the lantern maker transforms grief, with cost legible when she holds up the lantern and the shadow dissolves. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the glass basilica and floating island constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details (e.g., lavender smoke, bioluminescent moss) are filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of overcoming grief escalates through protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, culminating in the confrontation with the shadow. Cost is unmistakable in the "luminous torment" and the shadow's dissolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transforming grief emerges organically through images (lanterns, cranes) and events, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext operates in gestures like polishing gems and folding cranes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic and consistent, with no head-hopping; elision (e.g., grief folding) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language (e.g., "grief with wings") is purposeful and enhances clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of dream recording, floating islands, and grief transformation, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in metaphorical depth heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
