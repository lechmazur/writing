<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The ghost bride's motivation is clear and layered, driving the plot with consistent traits, but Elara's characterization is thinner, serving more as a catalyst than a fully realized protagonist. Her curiosity triggers the climax, but her interiority lacks the depth and contradiction seen in the ghost bride. The final choice is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the dissolution and transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with felt cost—the ghost bride's freedom and the greenhouse's dawn—under a causal lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph, and the plot's cause-and-effect chain, from Elara's action to the resonant awakening, is tight and inevitable. The cost is legible in the final image of blooming fields and lingering laughter.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting is essential, constraining choices and charging the final image with its transformation from endless night to dawn. Vivid, sensory details like "frost clung to glass panes" and "crystalline fruits" are purposefully woven into action and atmosphere. The environment directly pressures the ghost bride's actions and Elara's discovery, making it indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency in placing the bead, triggering the resonant awakening that narrows options and leads to closure. The dominant stake of debt repayment intensifies through this act, with cost legible in the ghost bride's dissolution and the greenhouse's change. Pressure coheres under the causal lens, though Elara's role is somewhat passive initially.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of transcending debts and the coexistence of love and venom emerges organically through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with Elara's realization, avoiding moralizing. Subtext is rich in the ghost bride's silent appearances and the bead's symbolism, though occasional lines verge on explicitness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person with a lyrical, distinct voice that reflects the gothic tone. The ghost bride's ephemeral appearances are filtered through Elara's perception, maintaining coherence. Dialogue is minimal but effective; prose rhythm controls pressure without obscuring clarity. Minor POV shifts to the ghost bride are handled smoothly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density, advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "gown, woven from the threads of a thousand funerals" is consistent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, and the final image resonates with clarity and cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes ghost lore and alchemy with fresh specificity, transforming tropes through grounded character choices. The ghost bride's layered motivation and the bead's role feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure image is uniquely charged.</comment>
