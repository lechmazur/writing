<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation is clear and rooted in pain, driving her to seek the stone; her internal conflict is embodied in micro-choices like tracing the stone's surface. The final realization that home is in remembering is earned through causality, with visible cost in the shards embedding. However, some emotional beats rely on slightly stock phrasing (e.g., "woke gasping"), preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing via Lirael's realization, cost legible in the pain from shards and the transformed hands. Causal lens holds tightly from avoidance to seeding, with no orientation debt. The feather's use and stone's shattering create a decisive change that reweights the premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices: the labyrinthine bookstore forces navigation, and the attic/cavern transition charges the final image. Sensory details like "dust motes swirled like tiny galaxies" are selective and POV-filtered. The stone and feather as micro-settings directly shape tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lirael's agency under the causal lens, from avoidance to active seeding, narrowing options to a climax where she bears others' memories. Cost is unmistakable in the pain of shards and the transformation. However, the stakes slightly abstract until the final beat, limiting peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the stone as mirror reconfigures memory and home without moralizing. The ending's non-literal answer ("home is in the act of remembering") resonates through prior images like the feather dissolving. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, avoiding exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature ("mercury skin reflecting the glow"). Dialogue is minimal but natural; elision in transitions is taught and paid off. No head-hopping, and diction remains within Lirael's lexicon, though minor register consistency issues in peak beats prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "shadows as sharp as knives"). Sentence-level propulsion accelerates during the climax, though a slight over-reliance on visual senses in early descriptions holds it back from 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of mercury-glass seer, lost language stone, and seeding via feather, transforming tropes through specific world logic. The non-obvious integration of buried talents and home concept feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
