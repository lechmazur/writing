<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lila's characterization is deeply embodied, with PTSD tremors and somatic choices under pressure. Her motivation to find stillness is clear and intensifies, compelling her final realization. The relationship with Mrs. Voss acts as a crucible, forcing choices that alter her stance. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her steady heart.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through sensory density to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the cost is legible when Lila tucks the photo away without freezing. The lens holds without ambiguity, and the closure reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The arboretum setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "cold stone" and "salt scent" filtered through Lila's POV. It pressures her somatic practice and mirrors her internal state. The environment is indispensable, shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of internal peace vs. grief escalates under the Accumulative lens through Lila's agency in somatic marking. A meaningful tightening occurs when she flinches but anchors herself, narrowing options. The cost is visible in her steady heart and light steps, foreclosing the path of perpetual grief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of anchoring optimism in realism emerges through particulars like the photograph and lavender, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the "pearl of stillness" lens. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm modulates with emotional pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "pearl of stillness" is coherent and purposeful. Minor register consistency in peak beats prevents a higher score, but clarity is uncompromised.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of drone strike survivor with somatic markers and arboretum setting feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and theme. Risk-taking in quiet structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
