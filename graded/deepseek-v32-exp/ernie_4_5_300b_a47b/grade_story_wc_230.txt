<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's rationality and motivation are consistent, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as using the glass eye on Jorn. Her final decision to "occlude" with truth is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds with clear because/therefore linkages, such as the glass eye enabling Jorn's confession. Closure is a decisive change with cost legible in Mara's shift to using truth as a weapon, reconfiguring options. Orientation is anchored early, and the persistent constraint of the virus shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the orchard and storms pressuring choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, like the "chandelier of green" metaphor. The glass eye functions as a micro-setting that constrains action and deepens theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, moving from truffle foraging to confronting systemic truth. The dominant stake of psychological safety tightens with the ledger reveal, forcing a trade-off with visible cost. No coincidental resolution; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, exploring truth versus safety without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the glass eye's use, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mara's realization. Complexity is embraced with plausible ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—rational and methodical. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in Jorn's confession. Prose rhythm and diction control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful, e.g., "chandelier of green." Sentences advance story and character without register drift or artifice in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of post-virus world, truffle foraging, and truth-blurring relic, transformed through specific choices. Risk-taking in conceptual integrity heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth is specific and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
