<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his role as a ghost whisperer seeking to salvage pure connections. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as his chest aching upon learning the widow's grief. His micro-choices, like placing the globe on the altar, reveal a hierarchy of values focused on delicate truth-weaving. However, his agency feels slightly passive in the dream sequences, lacking overt struggle that would heighten tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds strong, with dream fragments building density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration closure. Kael's decision to weave truth into dreams reconfigures the stakes with visible cost in the emotional weight carried by the living. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph, anchoring who, where, and when. The closure lands on the page with the candles flaring as a beacon, making the cost of connection legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like the glacier's icy wall and flickering candle shadows, all filtered through Kael's POV. The shrine and melted snow globe function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. The glacier's hum of approval integrates environment with thematic resonance. Specificity is purposeful, though some descriptions border on generic mystical tropes without undermining coherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvaging pure connections—escalates through dream revelations that deepen Kael's understanding and compel his decision to act. Under the Accumulative lens, density increases with each dream, reweighing options and costs. Agency is demonstrated in his choice to expose truth through dreams, foreclosing passive observation. The cost is felt in the emotional revelations, but the escalation lacks a tightening causal turn, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the snow globe's evolving symbolism and the dream sequences, exploring connections between living and dead without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Kael's decision and the final image of open windows. Subtext operates in the ghost's murmured blame and the widow's unrealized daughter. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality by grounding abstractions in concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical voice featuring phrases like "borrowed starlight" that reflect Kael's perceptual signature. Purposeful compression in dream fragments is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift; diction remains consistent with the mystical tone. However, the voice occasionally verges on over-poetic, slightly distancing the reader from immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with strong rhythmic control, as in the cadence of "flickering shadows that danced like ghosts." Information density is high, with sentences advancing both atmosphere and character. Minor artifacts include a slight overreliance on metaphorical language in peak beats, but no loops or scaffold issues obscure causality. Clarity and momentum are maintained through to the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes ghost whispering and dream analysis with fresh specificity, avoiding cliché through the melted snow globe and glacier setting. Emotional truth is grounded in particular details like the lighthouse keeper's enduring wait. Risks in structure (dream mosaics) heighten stakes without gimmickry. However, the core concept shares echoes with familiar spiritual communication tropes, limiting transformative originality.</comment>
