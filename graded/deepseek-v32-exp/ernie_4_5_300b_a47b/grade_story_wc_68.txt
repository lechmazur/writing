<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and micro-choices revealing values; his final endurance is earned with visible cost, though minor contradictions in his rational rebellion slightly limit peak impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise as Mara stays and Elias feels understood, cost legible in his physical pain; causal lens holds tightly with orientation clear early, and sediment digging persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
