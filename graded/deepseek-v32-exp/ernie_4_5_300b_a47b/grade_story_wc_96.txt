<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cedar's molting personality and rebuilding through the tin are concretely embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing hierarchy of values. The final shift to growing through chaos is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his fractured mind reforming.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, closure is a conceptual repricing as Cedar reconfigures his approach to identity. Cost is legible in the on-page realization: "maybe the answer wasn’t to rebuild but to grow through the chaos," shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rusted library setting constrains choices (tin hidden under floorboard) and charges the final image of blooming resistance. Sensory details like "flickering bulbs strung like desperate fireflies" are selective and purposeful, filtered through Cedar's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Cedar's agency under accumulative lens, with cost unmistakable in his molting and realization. Dominant stake of internal identity struggle tightens through interactions with Marla and the tin, foreclosing old paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of blooming resistance emerges through particulars like the tin and poems, with ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer: "to forge beauty from anarchy, you must first become the anarchy." No moralizing, subtext operates in silence and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature; poetic prose reflects Cedar's mind, e.g., "his words a luminous fracture against the darkness." Dialogue with Marla is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "flapped like a moth’s wings" serves atmosphere without muddle; sentence-level propulsion accelerates with emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of molting personalities and blooming resistance feels inevitable, with risk-taking in accumulative structure heightening stakes. Specificity in details like the coffee tin and berry ink avoids template plots, transforming familiar tropes.</comment>
