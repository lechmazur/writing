<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final promise to finish the symphony is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her trembling hands and whispered commitment. Contradictory impulses (thrill vs. skepticism) act in scene, and her decision forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with strong because/therefore linkages, from discovering symbols to the closure promise. Orientation is clear within 120 words. Closure lands as a Charged Poise with cost legible in the timpani's approval and Clara's whispered vow, reconfiguring options under the inferred lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory detail (flickering lanterns, murky water) and constrains choices, such as water revealing symbols. The flooded opera house acts as a micro-setting that pressures tactics and charges the final image, integrated through POV-filtered perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unraveling the code) escalates under the causal lens through Clara's agency, from discovery to pattern recognition. Cost is legible in her memorization and commitment, narrowing options and forcing a trade-off with the ghost's unfinished work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from events and images, such as the wordless conversation and in-between spaces, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Clara's promise, reweighting prior material with purposeful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical prose and selective attention to details like the humming water. Voice remains coherent under pressure, with no head-hopping or register drift, and elision (e.g., ghost's presence) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language (e.g., "sheet music floating like lost confessions") is purposeful and clear, supporting momentum and closure without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of ghost story and artistic pursuit, transformed through specific details like the water-damaged program. Risk-taking in atmospheric buildup pays off with inevitability, and the concept commits fully without gimmickry.</comment>
