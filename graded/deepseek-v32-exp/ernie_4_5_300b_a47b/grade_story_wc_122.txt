<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is clear and rooted in her traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The therapy-speak label "emotional numbness" slightly detracts, but her internal conflict and transformation are earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the accumulative/textural lens, closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lila realizes silence is a container, with felt cost in her chest ache. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The drum maker's cavern and phonograph constrain choices and charge the final image, with vivid sensory details filtered through Lila's POV. The setting actively shapes tactics and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Lila's agency with the filament of hush, narrowing options and leading to a legible cost (fraying numbness). One meaningful tightening is sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, such as the backward songs and silence as a container, offering a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with no head-hopping. Purposeful compression supports the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, even in peak beats, supporting clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a deaf music teacher using backward songs to overcome numbness is fresh and non-obvious, with risk-taking that heightens stakes. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
