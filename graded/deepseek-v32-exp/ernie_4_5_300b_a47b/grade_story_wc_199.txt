<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elinor's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with micro-choices like prodding the dust speck revealing her hierarchy of values. Her final purpose is earned by prior causality, though interior contradiction could be deeper. No major flaws touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Elinor decodes the messages and commits to action, with cost legible in her transformed purpose. The causal lens holds strong, and orientation is anchored early. Minor hairline slip in pacing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The arbor setting constrains choices (e.g., edge where branches thin) and charges the final image with vivid, sensory details. Environment is integral to tactics and closure, with no generic elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elinor's agency under the causal lens, from prodding the dust to building monuments, narrowing options with legible cost. Dominant stake in decoding messages tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from folklore and transformation, with subtext in the moonstone dust and monuments. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though ambiguity is slight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Poetic prose is voice-motivated and legible, with no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and clear in peak beats, supporting propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines through specific synthesis of elements like the skyborne arbor and folklore, transforming tropes with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
