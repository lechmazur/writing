<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to reconcile with Mara is earned through river insights, with visible cost in loosened grief. However, minor abstraction in phrases like "symphonically minded" slightly reduces immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as sisters reconnect and release the chrysalis, costing endured grief. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern density (river foam, chrysalis). Orientation is anchored early, and causality is tight from insight to action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The braided ravine and chrysalis function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, with the river's patterns mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens occurs through pattern density and cadence shifts, driven by Elara's agency in gaining insight and responding to Mara. Cost is legible in emotional trade-offs, though pressure is more thematic than causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of separation/connection emerges organically from particulars like the rivers and chrysalis, with the ending offering a non-literal reweighting via the released chrysalis and shared horizon. No moralizing; subtext operates in gestures and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature blending scientific and musical metaphors. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though limited. Elision is purposeful, and voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic control and high information density without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peaks like the foam insight. Sentences advance story and character with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing polymer chemistry, river ecology, and grief into a non-obvious whole. Tropes are transformed through specific details, though the core premise is familiar; risk-taking in structure elevates stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
