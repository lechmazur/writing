<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kieran's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. However, internal conflict is underdeveloped, with no contradictory impulses acting in scene, limiting depth. The final choice to descend is earned by prior causality but lacks visible cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a decisive change with cost felt in the risk and hope; causal lens holds strong with tight linkages from sundial to cradle discovery. Orientation is anchored early, and the quill holder as a persistent constraint shapes tactics. Cost is legible in the final image of light flickering in the cradle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details and micro-setting like the sundial constrain choices and charge the final image, enhancing atmosphere. The fort and blackout pressure decisions, but spatial choreography is slightly vague during the descent. Sensory selection reflects urgency well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through protagonist agency under the causal lens, with cost legible in the unlocking of the cradle. However, the blackout's urgency could be sharper, and the escalation relies heavily on dialogue rather than action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of revolution through knowledge emerges organically from events and symbols, with subtext in dialogue and a resonant ending without moralizing. The cradle of sparks as a concept integrates well, but the theme lacks complexity or meaningful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; dialogue is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping, but voice convergence occurs under pressure, slightly flattening character distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with good information density and varied syntax; no major loops or scaffold. However, phrases like "winking hush" feel slightly purple, and minor register drift occurs in peak beats without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rebellion tropes through intellectual means and specific details like the sundial cipher; risk-taking in quiet revolution heightens stakes. However, the premise is not fully transformative, leaning on familiar archetypes.</comment>
