<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her desire to conquer self, driving higher-stakes choices. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, e.g., "a subtle tug in her gut." Internal conflict shows in her hesitation at the forked path, and the final choice to embrace all versions is earned by prior causality with visible cost when she descends.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change as Mara descends and finds peace, a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. Causal lens holds strong through because/therefore linkages in timeline choices. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible in "her feet touching the ground for the first time in years."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the glowing viaduct and wet stones creating atmosphere. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, e.g., "residual luminescence." The viaduct and tablet constrain choices and charge the final image, reinforcing theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake in self-conquest is signaled early and escalates through timeline choices, narrowing options. Agency is clear in Mara's decisions, e.g., choosing the right path. Cost is legible when she embraces all versions, foreclosing other paths under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of self-acceptance emerges through events and images, not direct statement. Subtext operates in the labyrinth metaphor and timeline convergence. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "the gravity defier in her wanted to float above the choice." Voice is poetic and controlled under pressure, with purposeful elision in timeline shifts. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and enhances clarity, e.g., "darkening brightness." Sentence-level propulsion supports momentum, and no artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of fractured timelines and procedural generation of self, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific character choices, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
