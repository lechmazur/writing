<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her traits, with concrete interiority shown through her actions with the prism and stone. However, internal conflict is subtle, and the final endurance feels earned but lacks high-stakes contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in her peace and connection. Orientation is clear early, and structure is a single scene with coherent causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with Pearl Bay and the mist constraining choices (e.g., wading into water) and charging the final image. Micro-setting elements like the prism and pond are integral to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seeking value in the mundane) escalates under Accumulative lens through sensory build-up; protagonist agency in tossing the stone and using the prism leads to a legible cost in her emotional shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and imagery, with subtext in the prism and ripples; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic perceptual signature; no head-hopping. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and elision is purposeful, supporting pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and enhances peak beats without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept of a glazier using a prism for reckonings is fresh and specific, synthesized organically; risk-taking in quiet reflection heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
