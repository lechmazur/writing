<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions like the vault's chill seeping into his bones. His methodical curiosity drives proactive choices, and the final understanding is earned through causal actions, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal plot with clear closure: the henge opens as a bridge due to Elias's actions. Cost is legible in the physical effort and emotional shift, and the lens holds without ambiguity, though the cost is subtle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like the rain-scoured frescoes and henge stones constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory elements are filtered through Elias's POV, enhancing atmosphere without clutter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elias's agency, such as comparing film footage and using tools at the henge. Cost is legible in the anticipation and effort, but the escalation lacks a sharp, tangible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence as language emerges organically from events like the journal note and chant. The ending reweights prior material without moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the chapel's warmth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with a distinct perceptual signature, evident in Elias's detailed observations. Voice remains consistent under pressure, though dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and varied syntax, maintaining momentum. No loops or scaffold issues; figurative language like "smudge of ink" is purposeful and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements like silent film comparison and whispered chapel feels inevitable. Risk-taking in conceptual depth heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
