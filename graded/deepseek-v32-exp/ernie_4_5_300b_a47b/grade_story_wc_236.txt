<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is strong with clear motivation rooted in her loss of smell, driving her to read emotions through objects. Her micro-choices, like noticing the engraving, reveal embodied emotion and hierarchy of values. The final act of writing the note is earned by prior causality, though the resolution feels slightly tidy, lacking contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Plot coherence under the Accumulative/Textural lens is excellent, with discoveries (engraving, photo) leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure. Cost is legible in Mrs. Voss's guilt and Lira's understanding. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity, with the screw's reweighting charging the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the water clock shop and fog mirroring Lira's internal state and constraining choices. The screw as a micro-setting object charges the closure, and sensory details are purposeful and integrated. Environment shapes tactics and final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early, with Lira's need to resolve the screw's significance escalating through her agency under the Accumulative lens. Discoveries tighten options, and cost is felt in the emotional resolution. One meaningful deepening occurs, though the escalation lacks a high-stakes trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of resilience and reading between lines emerge organically through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the screw's redemption, avoiding moralizing. Subtext in gestures and implication enriches complexity without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature focused on sensory and emotional mapping. Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with purposeful compression. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure, though minor convergence in tone under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no major loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats. Minor overwriting in descriptive passages slightly dulls momentum, but closure remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality is high with a fresh synthesis of elements (aromatherapist, water clocks, midwife's screw) that feels organic and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific details, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Closure is legible and charged.</comment>
