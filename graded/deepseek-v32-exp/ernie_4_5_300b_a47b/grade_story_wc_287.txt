<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and drives the narrative; his micro-choices under pressure, such as visiting Mara, reveal his values. Mara's change feels earned through their interaction, though Elias lacks significant internal conflict, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mara lets light in, with felt cost of her grief; the accumulative/textural lens holds consistently, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the harbor and gauge tooth enriching atmosphere; the tooth charges the final image but does not heavily constrain choices, capping the score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias's agency drives escalation under the accumulative lens, with stakes clear in his pursuit to bring light; cost is legible in Mara's emotional shift, though conflict is low-key.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in darkness emerges through particulars like gardening and the gauge; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
