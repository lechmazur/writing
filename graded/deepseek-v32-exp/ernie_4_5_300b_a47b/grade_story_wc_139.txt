<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is concrete with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as her decision to taste the ink and step out from hiding. Her motivation is clear and rooted in her father's teachings, intensifying to compel high-stakes choices. The final choice to trade the scroll for asylum is earned by prior causality with visible cost, though minor moments like her freezing when mentioned feel slightly summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with clear because/therefore linkages, from Elara's hiding to her active waiting and negotiation. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost in the asylum deal and father's hiding, anchored early. Orientation is solid within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the funeral home prep room pressuring choices through the casket and agents' presence. Sensory details like lilies and ironed linen are selective, and the ink pot as a micro-setting constrains choices and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent during Elara's reveal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of political asylum and safety escalates through Elara's agency, with one meaningful tightening when she reveals the scroll and negotiates. Cost is legible in the trade-off for asylum, driven under the causal lens. However, the agents' quick capitulation slightly softens pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of trust in math and active waiting emerges through events like the ink pot's use and Elara's strategies, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the promise to "find the mathematics of a fair trade," avoiding moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and implications.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Elara's analytical voice. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in the negotiation with agents. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, such as the father's backstory anchored in present cues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without scaffolds. No major artifacts or loops; figurative language like "footsteps echoing like a metronome" is purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs, though minor clichés like "world blurred" appear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of con artist tropes with math and political intrigue feels fresh and inevitable, transformed through specific choices like the ink pot's role. Risk-taking in the premise heightens stakes without gimmickry. The closure reconfigures prior material with ingenuity.</comment>
