<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation to navigate by starlight for herself is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with micro-choices like using the chain link revealing her values under pressure. Her interior contradiction—feeling adrift yet determined—is embodied in quiet moments, and the final sense of purpose is earned through prior causality. However, minor diagnostic label-speak ("somber marvel") slightly dulls peak emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with Lirael's felt purpose, cost legible in her earlier adriftness. Accumulative lens holds, building through teaching beats and the chain link's reprise. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the constraint of alien light shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with benthic gloom and pressure, filtering through Lirael's POV to constrain choices like the edge expedition. The chain link as micro-setting charges the final image by reflecting starlight, and sensory details (cold water, faint glow) are purposeful and integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Lirael's internal conflict between feeling adrift and finding purpose) escalates under the accumulative lens through her agency in teaching at the edge. Cost is legible in the "somber marvel" and her renewed purpose, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of embracing unfolded horizons emerges through concrete events like the chain link lesson and Tarel's question, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Lirael's realization, with subtext in dialogue enriching complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, poetic yet controlled prose, and dialogue that advances plot naturally. Voice modulation under pressure ("somber marvel") remains coherent, and elision (e.g., reflection on chain link) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or scaffolds harming closure. Figurative language ("alien constellations," "unfolded horizons") is consistent and purposeful, though minor register drift ("balancedly curious") occurs without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes benthic city and alien navigation freshly, with specific details like edge geometry transforming tropes. Risk-taking in quiet, reflective arc heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable from prior particulars.</comment>
