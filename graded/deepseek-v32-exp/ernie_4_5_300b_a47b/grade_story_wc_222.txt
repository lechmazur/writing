<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., swapping pieces despite groaning) revealing his values. Interiority is concrete, though lacks contradictory impulses; final choice to swap the king is earned with visible cost (risk of collapse).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with cost (sky clears after king swap, averting collapse), under a causal lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and structure is a single continuous scene with coherent causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (icebound spire, bioluminescent chamber) constrains choices (narrow ledge, window access) and charges the final image. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, with spatial choreography clean.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preventing collapse) escalates under causal lens via Kael's agency (swapping pieces triggers groaning, shaking). Cost is legible on-page, with one meaningful tightening that narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (courage to embrace unknown, wonder) emerges through action and image, not statement; ending reweights prior material without moralizing, though last paragraph leans slightly explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm and diction control heighten pressure without head-hopping. No dialogue present, so those bullets are waived.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of thief-as-wonder-apprentice and magic chess pieces feels inevitable; risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure is legible.</comment>
