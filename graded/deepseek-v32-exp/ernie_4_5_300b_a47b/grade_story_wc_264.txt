<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kael's dreamlessness is a consistent trait that motivates his curiosity and eventual choice to fix the clock; his internal conflict is embodied in the ache he feels, and his decision to cultivate sparks is earned by prior causality with visible cost when he dreams for the first time.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change with felt cost—Kael dreams and the sparks grow—under a coherent Causal lens; the persistent constraint of his dreamlessness shapes tactics, and orientation is clear early with who, where, and when anchored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The glowing dune and archive towers are vivid and purposeful, constraining choices when the sand dims at the clock's touch and charges the final image of erupting light; sensory details like "burnt honey and static" are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the Causal lens, from discovering the clock to choosing to fix it; cost is legible when he dreams and the archives shudder, narrowing options and foreclosing his dreamless state with visible transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of dreams and imagination emerges through concrete images like the clock and sparks, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with Kael dreaming of forests, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is clear in Kael's biased observations, and rhythmic control under pressure is evident in lines like "the sand beneath his feet dimmed"; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "fractured lullaby of heat and light" is consistent and purposeful, and peak beats maintain clarity with varied syntax and rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh, specific details like the divergent archive and wave functions; risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable from established pattern.</comment>
