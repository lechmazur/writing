<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to defeat emotional numbness is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and micro-choices revealing his values. The clone serves as a effective mirror, though some dialogue edges toward cliché ("You're obsolete"). The final choice to merge energies is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his raw emotions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (merging with the clone) and felt cost (emotional rawness), under a causal drive lens that holds throughout. The brain in the jar acts as a persistent constraint shaping tactics. Orientation is clear early, and the structure tightens coherently to the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo and swirling sky provide vivid, purposeful sensory detail that constrains choices (e.g., platform shuddering during the battle). The environment charges the final image of descent, with spatial choreography remaining clear and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (custody of existence and defeating numbness) escalates through Kael's agency using complementary opposites, narrowing options and leading to a climax with unmistakable cost (clone's destruction). Pressure coheres under the causal lens, with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of identity and choice emerges organically from events, with subtext in the clone's deception and Kael's realization. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("You're a choice") without moralizing, reweighting prior material through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, and voice modulates under pressure (e.g., rhythmic control in battle beats). Dialogue is goal-driven and natural, with clear character distinction. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with clear propulsion. Minor overwriting in phrases like "history rewrote itself" slightly muddles sense, but no major artifacts or loops harm closure. Sentence-level craft supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The clone custody battle premise offers a fresh synthesis, transformed through specific character choices and world logic. Risk-taking in the conceptual frame heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the resolution feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
