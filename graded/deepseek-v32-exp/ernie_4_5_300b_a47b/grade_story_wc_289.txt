<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lila's motivation to find connection is clear and rooted in her profession, with interiority shown through embodied emotion like chest tightening. Her change from hiding truths to sharing them is earned by prior causality, such as the spiral triggering memory and the installation providing a catalyst. The final choice to encourage clients to speak truths has visible cost in her tears and realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with because/therefore linkages: Lila's visit leads to spiral interaction, Elara's guidance, and installation participation, culminating in a decisive change where she shares her secret. Closure lands with cost as her fear dissolves into the pond, reconfiguring her approach. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "prismatic quiet" and "cool stone," constraining choices—the spiral triggers memory, the pond accepts secrets. The temple environment charges the final image as Lila leaves with the thrush's song, reinforcing the theme. Micro-setting elements like the orb alter tactics and outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Lila's internal conflict about connection, escalating through her agency: touching the spiral, writing her secret, and releasing it. Cost is legible when she trembles and feels warmth, foreclosing her hollow path. Pressure coheres under the causal lens with one meaningful tightening that reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sharing secrets for connection emerges through particulars like the spiral's unraveling metaphor and the orb sinking, not direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Lila's decision to write her own letter, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, such as "prismatic quiet" filtering through Lila's bias. Dialogue with Elara is natural and goal-driven, advancing plot through whimsical yet purposeful exchange. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure with rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold; figurative language like "petal-strewn crown" is purposeful and clear. Momentum is maintained without artifacts, and closure image is undulled by line-level issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of love letter ghostwriter and temple setting feels organic, with tropes transformed through specific choices like the public art installation. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, and the final reconfiguration is earned through character causality. Risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
