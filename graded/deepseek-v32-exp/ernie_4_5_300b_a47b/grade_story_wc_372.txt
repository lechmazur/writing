<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as "frustration gnawed at her," and micro-choices reveal her values. The final success is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her exhaustion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal drive with clear orientation early. Closure is a decisive change on-page, as the illusions brighten, with felt cost in Elara's effort. The lens holds without ambiguity, and the fading magic constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly described with selective sensory details, such as "frosted panes" and "wind howled," and pressures choices by creating urgency. The library constrains action and charges the final image when illusions steady, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes are dominant and escalate through Elara's agency under the causal lens, as sampling frequencies narrows options. Cost is legible in her frustration and exhaustion, with a meaningful tightening when vows partially reconstruct before success.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of conjuring meaning from oblivion emerges implicitly through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the illusions brightening, avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature reflecting Elara's meticulous nature. Prose rhythm controls pressure, such as in the frantic sampling beats, and no head-hopping or elision issues occur.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts obscuring clarity. Figurative language, like "colors bleaching like old ink," is purposeful and coherent, supporting propulsion without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes magical vows and frequency sampling in a non-obvious way, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in method heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable from prior particulars.</comment>
