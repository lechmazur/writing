<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as her gentle interventions during negotiations. However, her character edges toward idealization with minimal flaws, slightly reducing complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the imperfect treaty signifies ongoing struggle, with cost felt in the "rough edges" and ambiguous language. The causal lens holds tightly from dawn to dusk, driven by Elara's agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like the "weathered statues" and "shimmering" stone, and the clipboard acts as a micro-setting that charges the final image. However, the terrace itself could more directly constrain choices beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of peace escalates through posturing, lull, and resolution, driven by Elara's agency in guiding delegates. Cost is legible in the "weary resignation" and imperfect treaty, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of redemption and compromise emerges organically through the clipboard's scars and the statues' symbolism, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing but occasionally echoes the concept too explicitly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Elara's rhythmic observations like "the slow dance of celestial bodies." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though minor convergence in delegate voices occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts; sentences like "Each mark was a testament to the fragile line between peace and ruin" advance multiple elements seamlessly. No loops or muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The peace negotiator premise feels fresh through specific details like the clipboard's history, and risk-taking in quiet resolution heightens stakes. However, it leans on familiar archetypes without full transformation.</comment>
