<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Althea's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with embodied emotions and micro-choices; her studious nature and the cost of endurance are earned, though minor label-speak in peak beats slightly limits the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) at closure; the notepad's growth shows cost, and orientation is clear early, but slight ambiguity in lens application prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, with the labyrinth and lamp charging the final image; sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere without clutter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes in collecting time textures escalate under the accumulative lens with Althea's agency during the lamp pulse; cost is legible in her trembling and the notepad's thickening, though escalation is subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of invented histories emerges through particulars without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer reweighting prior material, but minor abstraction in closure limits a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is lyrical and coherent under pressure, and any elision is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm with no loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats, supporting propulsion without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of time collection and bonsai labyrinths, transforming tropes through specific details; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
