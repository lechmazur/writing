<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's "sincerely insincere" shrug and felt exposure when offering clarity reveal contradictory impulses under pressure; Mira's earned renunciation of grief through unhooking chimes shows cost. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with no stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in Mira's "resolve hardening" and the harmonized chimes; causal lens holds via Elias's actions driving Mira's decisive change. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lighthouse and wind chimes act as micro-setting that constrains choice (e.g., chimes deciphering alters tactics) and charges the final image; sensory details like "salt-stained stone" and chime tones are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under causal lens: Elias dons the cloak, perceives nuance, and guides Mira to unhook chimes, narrowing options with cost in her emotional shift. Dominant stake (grief vs. clarity) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of doubt as filter emerges through particulars (cloak, chimes) without moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via "you decide which chimes to keep," reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Elias with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "world had turned to shades of gray"); dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit, as in Mira's "You're late" and Elias's retort.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control (e.g., "a fitting canvas for a conscience for hire"); no loops or scaffold issues, and figurative language like "hollow mirror shard" is coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise of "conscience for hire" synthesizes fresh, non-obvious angle on ghost tropes through specific tools (cloak, chimes); risk-taking in lyrical closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
