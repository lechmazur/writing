<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's meticulousness and evolution from data-driven isolation to active truth-seeking are concretely embodied through micro-choices, such as cross-referencing maps and following the woman, with visible cost in his altered solitude. Interiority is specific and contradictory impulses act in scene, earning the final renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Elias redefines his role, burning the message and vowing to share truths, with felt cost in his lost isolation. Causal lens holds tightly from message to investigation to action, and orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The courtyard and quarantine zone function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like fog and ash selectively reflecting urgency. The storm recorder as a tool repeatedly alters tactics and outcomes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to public accountability, driven by Elias's agency in investigating the zone and accepting the sample. Cost is legible in the perimeter lights flaring and his faster retreat, narrowing options under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of integrity versus secrecy emerges through particulars like the recorder's data and the burned message, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the woman's rasped warning and Elias's smile.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature, blending scientific observation and emotional weight. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in the woman's terse exchange, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Sentences vary in structure and accelerate with pressure, such as the shrill alarm and fading distance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of storm recording and quarantine lie feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the quiet climax. Specific details like the recorder's dials and the circle-split symbol avoid template plots, transforming familiar tropes.</comment>
