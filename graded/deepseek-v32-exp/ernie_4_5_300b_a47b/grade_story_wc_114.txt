<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lirael's characterization is deeply embodied with contradictory impulses acting in scene, such as her algorithmic precision warring with her felt perceptions. Her final choice to leave the station is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in abandoning her role. Micro-choices under pressure, like investigating the director's office, reveal a hierarchy of values. The resolution forecloses a path with felt cost, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a decisive change—Lirael's departure—with felt cost in her smile and anchor, under a consistent causal lens. The orientation is clear within 120 words, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity. Persistent constraints like the station's instability shape tactics, and cost is legible in the final image of her carrying the truth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The mountain weather station and botanical illustration constrain choices and charge the final image, with the illustration's roots mirroring Lirael's internal shift. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV. The environment pressures her decision to leave, and the aurora's sorrow lingers in the closure, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lirael's agency under the causal lens, from investigating the quarantine folder to deciding to leave, with cost legible in her abandonment of the station. The dominant stake of truth vs. duty tightens through her choices, narrowing options. Her final act forecloses a path with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the bearberry's roots symbolizing truth's weight, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Lirael's smile and anchor, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures like smudging the illustration, and the concept integrates seamlessly with character arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in Lirael's poetic, analytical voice. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision is taught and paid off. The prose reflects her mindset without head-hopping, and dialogue is absent but not required, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, but occasional overwriting like "auroral sorrow" slightly muddles peak beats without harming closure. Rhythm varies naturally, and sentences advance story without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is generally coherent, though minor density issues prevent a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a fault-tolerant oracle with botanical and seismic elements feels inevitable in hindsight, offering a fresh angle. Risk-taking in style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional specificity avoids templates. The core premise is transformed through grounded choices in character and world logic.</comment>
