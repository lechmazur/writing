<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her grandfather's teachings, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her internal conflict (doubt vs. duty) and acceptance of flaws drive the resolution, earning the final choice with visible cost in the shattered puppet head.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the cracking pane and shattered puppet, redefining the end as a lullaby. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with orientation clear early, though the lighthouse discovery via letter is slightly convenient but not causal under this lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with the lighthouse, pane, and puppet head constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details (salt, decay) are purposeful and filtered through Mara's POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Mara's agency, from using the puppet to singing the lullaby, with cost unmistakable in the pane cracking and clocks slowing. Dominant stake (gentle end) tightens through density increase and reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in flaws emerges organically through events and images, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the lullaby and shattered puppet. Subtext operates in implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice remains consistent, and purposeful elision (e.g., grandfather's teachings) is taught and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm, though slightly dense figurative language in peaks doesn't harm clarity. No loops or scaffold artifacts; propulsion is clear, and closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, synthesizing doomsday adjustment with poetic elements like the pane of hush, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and transformation through specific details avoids template plots.</comment>
