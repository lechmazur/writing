<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as a translator, with interiority shown through embodied actions like drinking the ink. Her final choice to retrieve the fragment is earned by prior causality, and micro-choices under pressure reveal her values. The closure involves a meaningful change with visible cost in the memory and fragment's weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly, with clear because/therefore linkages from seeking the fragment to retrieving it. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost in the memory and fragment's weight, anchored early in orientation. No causality breaks; the ending reconfigures stakes legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the alchemist's market and mural constraining Lira's choices. Details like "ink tasted of rust and ocean salt" are purposeful and filtered through POV. The lighthouse and mural charge the final image, elevating the score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieving the fragment) escalates through Lira's agency under the causal lens, from drinking ink to tracing hidden details. Cost is legible in the memory and the fragment's weight, narrowing options meaningfully. No coincidental resolutions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of honoring overlooked histories emerges organically from events and images, not statement, with subtext in the weaver's words. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the fragment's reweighting, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., noticing "cracks in a stall’s wooden beam formed a constellation." Voice is poetic yet controlled, and elision (like the ink's effect) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in peaks like "elusively tangible" slightly muddles clarity. No loops or scaffolds; sentences advance story efficiently. Figurative language is generally coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh specifics, like the between-worlds translator and intuitive anchors, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure is fully committed.</comment>
