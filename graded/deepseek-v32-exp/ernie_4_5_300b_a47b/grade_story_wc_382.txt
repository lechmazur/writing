<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his profession, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The woman's patience and nimbleness are consistently portrayed, and their relationship forces a choice that alters the state by the end. The final decision to use the seal is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the library's awakening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a causal lens with clear linkage from the note to the revelation and climax. Closure is a decisive change (the library awakening) with felt cost (shudder, dust, voice). Orientation is anchored early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, though the architect's non-human reveal feels slightly abrupt but integrated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly described with sensory details (wisteria vines, string lights, moon) that reflect POV bias. The rooftop garden and library dome constrain choices and charge the final image, with spatial choreography coherent and details woven into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learning the truth) is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency (Elias using the seal and speaking words). Cost is legible in the library's shudder and the voice answering, narrowing options under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of truth vs. lies emerges through events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the library's awakening, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Voice remains consistent under pressure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs without sluggishness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of a dead language tutor for buildings is fresh and synthesized with mystery and fantasy. Tropes are transformed through specific choices, and the closure feels earned. Risk-taking in blending genres heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
