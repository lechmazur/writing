<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clara's sympathetic skepticism is consistently embodied through micro-choices under pressure, such as her initial doubt yielding to wonder during transcription. Her internal conflict between logic and legend feels authentic, and the final stance shift is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her softened skepticism. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing mars peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Clara's changed perspective and the tile's glow, under a coherent accumulative/textural lens. The tile's memories drive escalation through patterned density, and orientation is clear within the first paragraph. No causality breaks or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The stargazer's tower and whale migration season are vividly sensory and purposeful, constraining Clara's choices by isolating her for reflection and charging the final image with the breached whales. Micro-setting elements like the tile and worktable are tactile and integrated into action, avoiding generic placeholder description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Clara's agency in transcribing the tile, narrowing her options from skepticism to embrace under the accumulative lens. The cost is legible in her foreclosed path of pure logic, though the stakes could be more visceral. One meaningful tightening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the tile and whale songs, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on connection across time without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like tracing the tile's grooves, and the final image reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a perceptual signature biased toward cosmic wonder, reflected in rhythmic prose like "songs meant for ears long gone." No head-hopping or register drift; elision in memory surges is taught and paid off at closure. Dialogue is absent, so not evaluated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "echoed through the water like distant hymns" is purposeful and coherent. Minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "a quiet fire") doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of memory entanglement with stargazing feels inevitable in hindsight, transforming tropes through specific details like the shifting tile patterns. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure effect remains legible.</comment>
