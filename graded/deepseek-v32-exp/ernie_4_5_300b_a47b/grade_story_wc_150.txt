<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotions and internal conflict between curiosity and caution. Her final choice to follow the faith is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the shrine's activation. Micro-choices under pressure reveal her values, and her diaspora returnee status deepens her arc without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with strong because/therefore linkages, leading to a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. The sundial's activation and Lirael's choice reconfigure stakes with felt cost, and orientation is clear early. Persistent constraints like the roots shape tactics, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the catacomb orchard constraining choices through roots coiling and charging the final image. Details are filtered through Lirael's POV, integrating action and atmosphere. The environment pressures tactics and supports theme without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring faith) escalates through Lirael's agency under the causal lens, with cost legible in her commitment and the shrine's glow. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sundial activates, narrowing options and forcing a choice. Coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of faith and restoration emerges implicitly through events and images, with subtext in gestures like the roots listening. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through Lirael's choice. Emotional aftereffect lingers with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and lyrical voice that modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control is strong, and elision (e.g., journey interruptions) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; dialogue, though minimal, feels natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion advances story and atmosphere, with no artifacts obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Story synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh specificity, such as the catacomb orchard and sundial base, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional truth avoids derivative premises.</comment>
