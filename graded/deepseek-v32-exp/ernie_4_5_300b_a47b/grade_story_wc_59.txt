<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Corvin's motivation to reawaken beauty is clear and intensifies under pressure, shown through embodied actions like cradling the egg and assembling the contraption. His internal conflict—determination mixed with doubt—is concrete, and the final choice to embrace the orb is earned by prior causality. The cost is visible in the transformation, fulfilling the quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the orb hatching and transforming the palace, reconfiguring the world with felt cost under a causal lens. The orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity. The egg's discovery and Corvin's efforts create tight because/therefore linkages, with the persistent constraint of the mechanical world shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The suspended palace and its mechanical elements constrain choices, such as the contraption assembly, and charge the final image of organic renewal. Sensory details like "crystal spires" and "air tasted of oil" are selective and purposeful, filtered through Corvin's POV. The setting actively pressures the narrative, passing the quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Corvin's agency under the causal lens, from hypothesizing to the egg's hatching, narrowing options and changing knowledge. The cost is legible in the palace's transformation and the orb's warmth. The dominant stake of reawakening beauty tightens meaningfully, with no coincidence resolving the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of organic vs. engineered beauty emerges through particulars like the egg and contraption, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the orb's light and world's renewal, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in images and implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical prose like "fractured grandeur" and "quaking reverie." Rhythm and diction control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid with strong propulsion, though minor overwriting occurs in phrases like "bitterly sweet crescendo." No loops or scaffold artifacts; syntax varies purposefully. Information density is high, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes organic rebirth and mechanical decay in a fresh, non-obvious way, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Specific choices like the egg's genesis and palace setting transform tropes. Risk-taking in lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure remains legible.</comment>
