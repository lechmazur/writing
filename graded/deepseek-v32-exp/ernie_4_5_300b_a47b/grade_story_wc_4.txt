<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her role as an archivist and her grandmother's teachings. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions and micro-choices (e.g., drawing, picking up the feather) under pressure. The final renunciation ("enough") is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her acceptance. However, contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, building through images and reflections to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the word "enough." Closure lands on-page with felt cost in Lila's shift from seeking to create to recognizing completeness. Orientation is clear early, and the structure (single POV, one scene with seamless time shift) fits scope, with persistent constraints (factory decay) shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details (lavender scent, visual arcs) filtered through Lila's POV. The environment constrains choice and charges the final image, as the factory ruins and lavender field directly influence her realization and actions. Micro-setting elements (map case, photos) are integrated into action and theme, enhancing specificity without ornamentation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is driven by Lila's agency through observations and reflections, tightening the stake of transmuting pain into art. The cost is legible in her acceptance of "enough," foreclosing a path with visible emotional price. However, the pressure coheres but lacks a sharp turn, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of collective healing and resilience emerges organically from particulars (arcs in photos, vines climbing) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "enough," reweighting prior material through image and implication. Subtext operates in gestures (dove as messenger) and earned wisdom, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical prose and selective attention to arcs and decay. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and rhythmic control supports pressure without head-hopping or elision issues. No dialogue present, but internal coherence is exemplary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, with no muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion and clarity are maintained, and the read-aloud test passes smoothly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of decay and healing through specific, grounded details (lavender field, factory ruins). The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in the lyrical, reflective style that heightens stakes without gimmickry. However, it stops short of being fully rare due to familiar thematic roots.</comment>
