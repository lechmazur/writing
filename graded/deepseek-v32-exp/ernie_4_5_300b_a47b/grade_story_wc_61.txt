<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lumin's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal internal conflict. The final renunciation of destructive fire in favor of a gentler light is earned through prior causality, with cost legible in the gear's abandonment and the ghost's dissolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the accumulative/textural lens, closure lands as a conceptual repricing with cost felt in Lumin's realization and the gear's left-behind spin. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the ghost encounter serving as a pivotal tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The nebula garden constrains choices through sonar pinging and crystalline trees, charging the final image with sensory vividness. Details are selective and POV-filtered, integrating action and theme without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lumin's agency under the accumulative lens, following sonar pinging to the ghost, with cost visible in the gear's abandonment. The stake—generational patterns as bridges—tightens meaningfully through a deepening that changes knowledge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like fire as language and the gear's calculations, with subtext in the ghost's dialogue. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through Lumin's decision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and poetic prose that modulates under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with no head-hopping; elision in the ghost's appearance is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though minor density in peak beats prevents a higher score, but clarity remains untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sci-fi and emotional depth feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific choices like fire as a gentle language. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
