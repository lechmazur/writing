<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clara's involuntary truthfulness is a consistent trait that drives key choices, such as her decision to speak publicly, which is earned through prior causality. Her internal conflict between candor as burden and weapon is embodied in micro-choices under pressure, like hesitating before opening the box. The final choice to reignite wonder carries visible cost in her social risk, foreclosing her passive routine.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change where Clara's speech restores wonder and power, with cost legible in her using previously burdensome truthfulness. Causal lens holds tightly: blackout prompts investigation, drone discovery leads to Voss's revelation, and action follows. Orientation is anchored early with Clara in her booth by the tower, city dark.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice: the lightning tower's failure forces Clara outside, and its cables' glow mirrors internal stakes. Sensory details like "hummed with restless energy" and "crunching gravel" are selective and POV-filtered. The tower as micro-setting charges the final image with brighter cables, reinforcing theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Clara's agency: she investigates drones, engages Voss, and chooses to speak, narrowing options from passive tallying to active advocacy. Cost is visible in her leveraging candidness, a former liability. Stakes tighten from personal curiosity to collective wonder under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of wonder vs. routine emerges through particulars like drone failures and Clara's speech, not assertion. The riddle "I am the keeper of the unseen" slightly moralizes but is integrated into plot. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through the child's widened eyes and golden light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable in Clara's perspective, with distinct perceptual signature like "tastes like regret" and "nectar dusk." Dialogue with Voss is natural and goal-driven, advancing revelation. Voice remains coherent under pressure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, e.g., "the air hummed with a restless energy." No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language like "nectar dusk" is purposeful. Sentences vary in structure, propelling momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes uniquely: drones pollinating doubt and tower running on collective awe feel organic, not derivative. Clara's candid trait transforms from social pariah to key weapon, heightening stakes. Final image recharges prior material with drones buzzing back in "nectar dusk," demonstrating bold risk-taking.</comment>
