<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and micro-choices that reveal internal conflict. The final choice to heed the scars is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the integration of the clipping and vanishing scars. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her hesitation and dread, deepening character complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost (scars vanishing, two moons), under an accumulative/textural lens that holds throughout. The orientation is clear early, and the labyrinth's reappearance and Lirael's integration of the clipping create a coherent before/after change. Persistent constraints like the scars shape tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the cobalt glade and Glass Labyrinth constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "ozone and elderberries" reflect POV bias, and the environment mirrors internal states, such as the shifting maze paths echoing Lirael's uncertainty. The glade's transformation at closure reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lirael's agency under the accumulative/textural lens, with a meaningful tightening as she heeds the scars and presses the clipping to her heart. The cost is legible in the scars' throbbing and the world's reconfiguration. Dominant stake (mending the covenant) is signaled early and deepens through her choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, such as scars as keys, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the two moons and integrated clipping, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures like the golden-eyed figure's whispers, inviting reflection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical syntax and rhythm under pressure. Voice remains consistent, with elision (e.g., the labyrinth's vanishing) taught early and paid off at closure. Dialogue, though sparse, carries subtext and advances plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language like "time pooled like spilled ink" is purposeful and coherent, though minor overwriting in dense metaphors may slightly dull peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in a fresh synthesis of dream-reality pacts and scar-based magic, transformed through specific character choices. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightening stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
