<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as her hesitation before interjecting. The final choice to draw is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in risking the emergent hush. However, her social perceptiveness is more told than shown, slightly reducing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Mara realizes unlearning is about new truths, with cost legible in her determination and the grotto's hum. The Hybrid drive lens (accumulative/textural with causal elements) holds, and orientation is clear early. The tile and mandala create persistent constraints that shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The grotto setting is vividly sensory and purposeful, constraining choices through acoustics and tiles, and charging the final image with the holographic pattern. Mist and whispers integrate with action, reflecting Mara's POV bias without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Hybrid lens, from discovering the tile to drawing the mandala, narrowing options and changing knowledge. Cost is unmistakable when she risks the silence for meaning, foreclosing a path with visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the sand mandala reweighting meaning, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to unlearning, but the mantra slightly echoes prompt-like language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, perceptual signature in sensory details, and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful compression in pattern-building is taught and paid off at closure, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no major loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though minor purple hues in peaks like "lilac unease" slightly reduce clarity without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of chalk art, whispering grotto, and emergent hush feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in pattern-driven resolution. Specific details avoid tropes, but the social perceptive attribute is underutilized for full transformation.</comment>
