<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to discover the texture of connection is clear and intensifies through embodied actions like murmuring questions and tracing symbols. Her final choice to "keep questioning" is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the reconfigured understanding of connection. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost in the mountain's song taking center stage. Causality is coherent from lab to cave, with the artificial pilgrimage driving a meaningful deepening. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the laboratory and cave acting as micro-settings that constrain choices, such as the lens aligning with sensors and the cave trembling as an instrument. Sensory details are purposeful and integrated into action, charging the final image of the mountain's hum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the Accumulative lens through density increase, from the lab's hum to the cave's melody, driven by Lira's agency. Cost is legible in her skin prickling at the "raw and ancient" texture of connection, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as the lens scratches encoding song, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to connection without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, and the final image reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic diction like "powerfully gentle" and "golden shadows," though minor register drift occurs in elevated phrases. Perceptual signature is consistent, and elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of sound as texture and artificial pilgrimage, transformed through specific details like the carbide lens grooves. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
