<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elric's characterization is strong with clear motivation shifting from abstract to concrete; his internal conflict during Lady Veyra's scream and subsequent realization show embodied emotion and earned change, though minor reliance on diagnostic language in epiphany slightly reduces impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost as Elric speaks and redefines safety; causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from neglect to resolution; orientation is immediate and cost is legible in the pure note melting snow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices, such as the cobalt walls dimming under strained silence; the piano bench bolt as micro-setting constrains Elric's actions and charges the final image with resilience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate coherently from Lady Veyra's scream to Elric's agency in speaking; cost is unmistakable in the thawing of frostbitten hope, though escalation relies slightly on a single catalyst.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, but the explicit moral "Safety is not the absence of sound..." in the climax slightly reduces resonance; subtext in the stained step and bolt reweighting remains strong.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic diction like "seraphically mundane"; perceptual signature is consistent under pressure, and elision in the stained step discovery is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "frozen mercury" is purposeful, and closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes silence and safety in a fresh, non-obvious way; specific details like nerve regeneration and cobalt salves transform tropes, and risk in voice heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
