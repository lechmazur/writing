<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation as an esoteric realist is clear and consistent, driving her actions like weaving the lattice. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (trembling hands, aching fingers), and her micro-choices under pressure reveal values. The final peace is earned through prior causality, though some abstraction in philosophy slightly limits depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lirael finds connection and purpose, with cost legible in the lattice's transience. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with patterns of connection escalating through her actions. Orientation is clear early, and no causality breaks occur, but the quiet resolution lacks a persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details (mist, moss, peach clouds) that pressure choices—the grotto as sanctuary enables her work. The moth wing and lattice function as micro-setting, constraining actions and charging the final image. Economy and POV filter are strong, with no generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honoring overlooked histories) escalates under the accumulative lens through Lirael's agency in weaving, tightening with the monarch's migration. Cost is visible in her effort and the transient lattice. One meaningful deepening occurs, but the escalation is quiet, lacking higher stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of transience and connection emerges through particulars like the moth wing and lattice, without moralizing. Subtext in gestures (butterfly landing) and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Earned wisdom arises from concrete struggle, though some philosophical terms lean abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice and perceptual signature (noticing threads, dew). Rhythmic control under pressure, with purposeful elision and no head-hopping. Diction remains within Lirael's lexicon, enhancing texture without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without scaffolds. Minor overwriting in metaphors (e.g., "mist curled like spun sugar") but no muddle or loops. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative design, and closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of esoteric realism with transient monuments feels fresh and inevitable. Specific details (moth wing, spider silk) transform familiar tropes. Risk-taking in quiet, introspective story heightens stakes without gimmickry, though it lacks bold structural innovation.</comment>
