<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation as a censored poet is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions like his scars aching in the cold. His final choice to rarefy his poetry is earned through prior causality, such as finding the cartographer's envelope and the storm's influence. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a conceptual repricing as Kael decides to mail his poem, reweighting his approach to scars and censorship with felt cost (his scars ache, storm kisses his wonder). The accumulative/textural lens holds, driven by reflective beats and the storm's intensification. Orientation is clear early, and no causality breaks occur.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory setting pressures choices, constraining Kael's vigil and influencing his reflection. Sensory details are vivid and selective, like the "iron ribs groaning" and "rain-streaked viewport," filtered through his POV. The environment charges the final image, with the storm mirroring his internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal—Kael's struggle for uncensored self-expression—escalating through the storm's fury and the poem's revelation. Agency is clear in his decision to rarefy his poetry, foreclosing his old path with visible cost (scars aching, sending the poem). Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens, with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, such as rarefaction and scars, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Kael's poem and action, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in implication, like the poem fragment deepening his understanding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic syntax and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is consistent, with purposeful compression in peaks, such as "furiously tranquil." No head-hopping or register drift; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, like "clouds roiled like liquid mercury." Sentence-level propulsion matches scene needs, and no artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements synthesize organically, with a fresh angle on censorship and self-expression through specific details like the observatory and scars. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, avoiding template plots.</comment>
