<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lila's motivation as a euthanasia tourist is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. Her internal conflict between numbness and seeking purpose is embodied through concrete actions, such as clutching the parasol tip and welcoming physical pain. The final flicker of peace is earned by prior causality, with the rescue acting as a decisive change that forecloses her path to euthanasia with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with strong because/therefore linkages, from Lila's volunteering to the rescue and realization. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where she feels peace, with cost legible in the final image of her sitting by the marina. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is vividly described with selective sensory details (e.g., "frozen bay," "cold seeped through her boots") that pressure choices and charge the final image. The parasol tip functions as a micro-setting object that constrains action during the rescue, enhancing atmosphere and specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Lila's internal conflict between detachment and purpose, escalating when she hears the sound and acts to rescue the woman. Agency drives the escalation under the causal lens, with cost visible in her altered perspective. The rescue tightens options and deepens her understanding, but the escalation is slightly muted by the team's involvement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, such as the fold in patience reconfiguring meaning without direct statement. Subtext operates in Lila's actions and the rescue, offering a resonant answer to grief and action. The ending avoids moralizing, but the concept of "fold in patience" is slightly overt in its articulation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature reflecting Lila's numbness and change. Voice is controlled and rhythmic, with dialogue natural when present. No head-hopping or register drift, though minor exposition in reflection slightly flattens momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and evocative with high information density, advancing story and atmosphere. Sentences vary in rhythm and structure, with no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The final image lands with clarity and resonance, supporting closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise of a euthanasia tourist in a frozen setting is fresh and organic, with tropes transformed through specific choices like the parasol tip rescue. Emotional truth and originality synthesize in a non-obvious way, though the concept of "fold in patience" risks slight abstraction.</comment>
