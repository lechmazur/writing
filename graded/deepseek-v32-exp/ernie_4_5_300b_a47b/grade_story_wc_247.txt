<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to translate silence into music is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion shown in micro-choices like signing to the camera. His quietly charismatic trait draws Lira naturally, and his final sadness adds cost, though internal contradiction is minimal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, closure lands with Charged Poise as the silence speaks and the world listens, cost legible in Kael's "twinge of sadness." Orientation is clear early, and the camera's constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The harbor setting is vividly sensory and purposeful, constraining choices as the waves "respond" to Kael's signs. The camera functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image, with no generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from Kael's solo disruption to Lira's collaboration and crowd gathering, driven by agency under the Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable in the music's "joyful sorrow" and Kael's post-climax sadness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as a canvas emerges through particulars like signing and music, with subtext in gestures. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, and perceptual signature is clear in Kael's filtering of the harbor. Dialogue is minimal but effective, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "liquid silver" is purposeful, and closure clarity is untouched by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes sign language, filmless camera, and music in a non-obvious way, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in lyrical design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
