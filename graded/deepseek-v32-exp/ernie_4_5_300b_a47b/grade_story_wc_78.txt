<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Leeward's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion (trembling hands, sweat) and micro-choices under pressure. Her final transformation of chaos into harmony is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in physical strain. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; interiority is concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost (effort, strain) under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early (who, where, when), and causality holds through her actions. The ending image of order from chaos lands with undeniable cost, and the lens is consistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (driftwood circle narrows movement, mallet use) and charges the final image. Sensory details are vivid and selective (salt spray, cloud scrolls), integrated into action. The floating orchard acts as micro-setting that pressures tactics and supports theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Leeward's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in physical strain and effort. Dominant stake (transforming chaos) tightens through her dubbing and strikes, narrowing options. No coincidence; pressure coheres and deepens with each layer.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images (obstacles as instruments, chaos to harmony) without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication (clouds as sheet music). Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material with cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and consistent with a distinct perceptual signature (poetic, sensory language). Voice modulates with pressure, and elision (fractal generating) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; rhythmic control under stress heightens stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and sentence structure. Minor overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "cumulus scrolls, their edges frayed like sheet music") but no muddle or loops that harm closure. Read-aloud test passes with momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis (floating orchard, tide prophet, sketched resonance) that feels organic. Turns are earned through character choice, and risk-taking in style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity anchors universals, avoiding template plots.</comment>
