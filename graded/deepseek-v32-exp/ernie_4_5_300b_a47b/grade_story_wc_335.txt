<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lirael's characterization is deeply rooted in consistent traits like walking backwards when nervous and using tea leaves for divination, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. Her internal conflict and combative tenderness are shown in scene, and the young woman's resolved decision is earned by prior causality. The final choice forecloses a path with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost as the woman commits to walking backwards, and the causal lens holds tightly from Lirael's actions to the resolution. The afternoon shadow shifting signals a new path, with cost legible in the woman's resolve and Lirael's heart lightening. Orientation is clear early, and no causality breaks occur.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like damp parchment and creaking swings, filtering through Lirael's POV. The forgotten library and shadow caught in glass constrain choices and charge the final image, reweighting meaning. Environment mirrors internal states and pressures tactics, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reversing exile to save the village) escalates through Lirael's agency in mentoring and the woman's decision to confront her past. Cost is legible in the sacrifice and emotional retracing, with one meaningful tightening under the causal lens. Minor rush in the woman's resolve slightly limits impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of reversible exile and resilience emerges through events and images like tea leaves and walking backwards, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the shifting light, reweighting prior material. Subtext in gesture and implication avoids abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Lirael's poetic observations and selective attention. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in the combative tenderness exchange. No head-hopping or register drift, but voice remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with purposeful figurative language like "shadow caught in glass" that avoids muddle. No loops or scaffolds obscure causality; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting in phrases like "jagged pattern" does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of shard-mirror archivist, tea leaf geometry, and reversible exile, feeling inevitable and transformative. Risk-taking in quiet, lyric closure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details like walking backwards are irreplaceable and charged with cost.</comment>
