<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's altruism is clear and consistent, driving her actions, but she lacks interior contradiction or flaws, making her somewhat one-dimensional. Her motivation compels higher-stakes choices, such as orchestrating the collective effort, and the final choice is earned with visible cost. However, the absence of genuine struggle or blind spots limits depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—the arch is saved and the nebula flares—under a causal lens, with cost legible in the collective effort. Orientation is strong early, and the messages create because/therefore linkages that narrow options. The persistent constraint of fading magic shapes tactics, and the ending reconfigures meaning without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the floating arches and orchard planet pressuring choices and charging the final image. The butterfly bell constrains action and recurs with meaning. Details are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding generic description, and the environment evolves causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of saving the arches escalates through Elara's messages and the settlers' mobilization, driven by agency under the causal lens. Cost is unmistakable in the collective work, and the resolution forecloses a path with visible cost. However, the conflict is external and lacks internal layers, limiting complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of collective hope emerges organically from events and images, such as the bell and nebula, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the bell's chime, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures and implications, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a poetic, ethereal texture that reflects Elara's perspective. Dialogue is minimal but messages serve as action-driven communication. Rhythm and diction control are consistent under pressure, though there is minor register elevation in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and propulsive, with varied sentence rhythms and high information density. No significant artifacts, loops, or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and coherent. The final image charges closure without muddle, and read-aloud flow is smooth.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost, orchard planet, and nebula feels fresh and inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details. Risk-taking in structure (messages as method) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise commits fully, though it echoes familiar themes of unity.</comment>
