<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. Her final realization and the seed's absence show earned endurance with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (orchard revitalized) and resonant reconfiguration (Elara's understanding of wonder as endless), with cost legible in the hollow left by the seed. Causal lens holds tightly from fracture sensing to ritual outcome, and orientation is anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (e.g., climbing the parapet, throwing seed into waterfall) and charges the final image with the radiant hush. Sensory details are vivid and selective, filtered through Elara's POV, with coherent spatial choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens, from sensing fracture to performing the ritual, with cost visible in the sap weeping and seed's absorption. Dominant stake (preserving color) tightens through meaningful turns that narrow options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of wonder preservation emerges through events and images like the seed and iridescent blossom, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, and the final reconfiguration resists tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure; voice is lyrical yet coherent, with no head-hopping. Elision (e.g., seed's dream voice) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no major artifacts or loops; figurative language is purposeful and clear, though minor overwriting exists in peak beats without harming closure. Sentences advance story efficiently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Concept of weaving between worlds is transformed through specific character and setting choices, with a non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure is legible.</comment>
