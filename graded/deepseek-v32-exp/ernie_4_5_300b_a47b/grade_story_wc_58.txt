<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to understand healing through absences is clear and consistent, driving her actions. However, her interiority lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, and the final lightness feels earned but somewhat tidy, missing deeper struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through sensory density to a Charged Poise closure where Elara reconfigures her understanding of absences with felt cost ("her heart lighter"). Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The shadowed garden and weft thread are vividly specific and purposefully integrated, constraining Elara's choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through her POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake in understanding healing escalates through Elara's agency in projecting presence and writing, narrowing options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in her emotional shift, though external conflict is minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of healing as geography emerges through concrete events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, enriched by subtext in the thread and vision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature. Elara's descriptive prose reflects her character, and rhythmic control supports pressure without head-hopping or clarity loss.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density, advancing story and atmosphere. No significant loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle; sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of writing obituaries for the living and projecting presence offers a fresh synthesis, transformed through specific details and emotional honesty. Risk-taking in lyrical design heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
