<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. Her chronological homesickness and desire to conduct unheard symphonies drive higher-stakes choices, and the final renunciation of exhaustion is earned with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Lirael's smile and glistening eyes, under an accumulative/textural lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the nautilus shell's role shapes tactics and the final image. No causality breaks or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details filtered through POV. The nautilus shell and glass spire constrain choices and charge the final image, integrating into action and thought. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict with time and desire to create symphonies) is signaled early and escalates under the accumulative lens through Lirael's agency in writing fortunes. Cost is legible in her emotional state and forecloses paths. Pressure tightens meaningfully without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in gestures and implications. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Lirael's creation, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is lyrical and coherent, with no head-hopping or register drift. Prose reflects Lirael's mind, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent, enhancing clarity without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and transformative, synthesizing elements into an inevitable whole. Specific details and emotional truth avoid templates, with risk-taking in lyricism that heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core concept integrates organically.</comment>
