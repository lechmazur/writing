<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's frugality is a consistent, embodied trait that drives her choices, such as bartering wages and sharpening intuition. Her internal conflict between skepticism and curiosity is shown through micro-choices under pressure, like brushing sand from the tile. The final renunciation ("I'll honor it") is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her reconfigured self-perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the tile's revelation as a "mirror" reweights the premise from external quest to internal covenant, with felt cost in Elara's gasped realization. Causal lens holds tightly from inciting incident (seeking the tile) to climax (voice interaction). Orientation is anchored by ~120 words with no disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific ("dust-caked stone walls," "bioluminescent light") and pressures choices—the palace's labyrinthine corridors constrain navigation, while the tile as micro-setting charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, reflecting Elara's professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens: her decision to place the tile triggers the wall opening, narrowing options. The dominant stake (sealing a covenant) tightens through her dialogue with the voice, culminating in a cost-legible trade-off (skepticism for curiosity).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars: frugality as "armor" and the tile as "lens" refract intentions into a non-literal answer about self-covenant. Subtext operates in the voice's irony ("A frugal mind decoding celestial secrets"), avoiding moralizing. The final word "Asharu" resonates without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Elara's astronomical lexicon ("celestial patterns," "star-chart eyes"). Prose rhythm modulates under pressure (e.g., short sentences in climax: "She gasped."). Dialogue with the voice carries subtext and advances plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density ("Encrypted devotion," she murmured). No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and coherent. Minor overwriting in peak beats ("infinitely patient, like a star waiting for its orbit") slightly dulls momentum but doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ancient mathematics and self-discovery feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (magic square, covenant) are transformed through specific choices in character (frugal astronomer) and closure (tile as mirror). Risk-taking in lyrical density heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
