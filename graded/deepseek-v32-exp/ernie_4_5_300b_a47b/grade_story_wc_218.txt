<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as caretaker, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as winding copper wire with "brazen calm." Her final renunciation of life is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her death. However, minor lack of contradictory impulses in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the orchard thrives and Lira dies, with felt cost in her final breath. The causal lens holds tightly through her actions, and the six-month timeframe persistently shapes tactics. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and no causality breaks occur.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the temple orchard and living stone pillars constraining choices and charging the final image.

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of balance emerges through concrete actions and images, such as the copper bridge, without moralizing.

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Lira's poetic interiority. Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., "brazen calm" during tension. Dialogue with the spirit is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmically varied, with high information density and no loops or artifacts.
