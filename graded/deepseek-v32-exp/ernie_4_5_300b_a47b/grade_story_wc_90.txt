<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira's pacifism is consistently embodied and drives her avoidance and eventual engagement; her internal conflict is dramatized in the meditation chamber, and the final choice to face her shadow is earned with visible cost when the locket shatters. However, some emotional beats lean slightly toward abstract therapy-speak, such as "grief and love were not opposites but twins," which slightly reduces specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with Lira opening the door and the ship stabilizing, under a causal lens where her confrontation directly resolves the crisis; cost is legible in the locket's destruction and her gravitational lightness, and orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship setting pressures choices through its decay, and the locket as a micro-setting object charges the final image by shattering to open the door; sensory details like "fused asteroid metal" and "bioluminescent trees" are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the causal lens, from ship shuddering to her shadow confrontation, narrowing options with cost felt in the locket's destruction; the dominant stake of saving the ship is tightly braided with her internal conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Lira's journey, with the garden as a non-literal answer to the central question of engagement versus avoidance; subtext operates through images like the locket and stitching, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, and the AI's dialogue carries subtext; perceptual signature is consistent, though minor register drift occurs in phrases like "shadow work" without full integration into Lira's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variation, with no major loops or scaffolds; figurative language is purposeful, though slight overwriting in "ghostly resolve that would echo through the stars" mildly reduces momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of sci-fi and philosophical themes feels fresh and inevitable, with specific details like quantum-engineered DNA and shadow work transforming tropes; risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
