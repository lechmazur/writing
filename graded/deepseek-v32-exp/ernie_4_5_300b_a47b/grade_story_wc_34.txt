<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion in moments like the trembling flower press. However, interior contradiction is underdeveloped, and his final choice, while earned, lacks deep internal conflict, limiting peak impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a charged poise under an accumulative/textural lens, with cost legible in the fading messages and ghost's memory. Orientation is clear early, and the flower press constrains the final image, but causality is more thematic than driven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the courtyard and flower press actively constraining choices and charging the closure. The mist and stones integrate seamlessly with action, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are internal but coherent, escalating through Elias's agency in encoding messages under the accumulative lens. Cost is felt in the transience of his efforts, though the abstract nature limits visceral impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken communication emerges organically through symbols like the ghost and bluebell, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal resolution. Subtext in gestures and silence avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively lyrical, with a consistent perceptual signature ("tinkersong wonder"). No dialogue, but elision and compression are taught and legible, supporting pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically varied and dense, with strong propulsion and no major loops or artifacts. Minor overwriting in phrases like "driftlingly alert" is voice-motivated and does not harm clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements like the ghost in code and graffiti feels fresh and inevitable, with risk in lyrical structure heightening stakes. Specificity in the flower press and courtyard anchors universals without gimmickry.</comment>
