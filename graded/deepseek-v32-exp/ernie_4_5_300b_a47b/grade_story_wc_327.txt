<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority (e.g., skin shimmering, tracing cracks). The final choice to hurl the diamond is earned by prior causality and reveals a credible flaw (fear of oblivion), with visible cost in her steady hands after the act. Contradictory impulses act in scene during the climax, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as she rejects the diamond's curse, achieving silence with felt cost (laughter, shouting, then steady climb down). The accumulative/textural lens holds, driven by sensory density and pattern breaks. Orientation is clear early, and the canyon's echoes persistently shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the canyon and bone towers constraining choices and charging the final image through echoes and runes. Sensory details are selectively filtered through POV, integrating action and atmosphere. The diamond and birds function as micro-settings that alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, from studying the diamond to harnessing bird patterns, culminating in a decisive choice with unmistakable cost (the canyon's roaring backlash). The dominant stake (translating texture into sound) tightens meaningfully, foreclosing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and imagery, such as the diamond as a mirror of fear, offering a non-literal answer to language extinction without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, and the final image reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that modulates under pressure (e.g., humming as mathematical geometry). Rhythmic control and purposeful compression enhance clarity, and no head-hopping occurs. Voice remains coherent through peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats (e.g., "a sound like shattering glass"). Sentences advance story and atmosphere with concision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes familiar elements (curse, storyteller) through specific, grounded choices like the copper-veined protagonist and texture translation. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in the accumulative design that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
