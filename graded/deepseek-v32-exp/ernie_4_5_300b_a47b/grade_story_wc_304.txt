<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions (trembling fingers, racing heart) and micro-choices (embellishing) that reveal her values. Her final endurance is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in her exhaustion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost ("exhausted but triumphant"), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds. The threshold's fragility shapes tactics, and orientation is anchored early without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the pool and emerald chip constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with cost legible in the pool cracking and her exhaustion. One meaningful tightening forces a trade-off, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of beauty enduring against oblivion emerges through particulars like the emerald's transformation, with subtext in gesture and image. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic diction and rhythmic control under pressure. Perception is character-specific, and any elision (e.g., static patterns) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied syntax without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with clarity maintained even in peak beats like the pool cracking.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and synthesized organically, with specific details (beautician mortician for celestials) transforming tropes. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
