<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion in raw fingers and steady hands. Micro-choices under pressure, like choosing the spiral path, reveal her values. The final sewing act is earned, though internal conflict is minimal for this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost legible in the labyrinth's shudder and Lira's effort. The Accumulative lens holds, with patterns building to restoration. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting vividly constrains choices, such as the labyrinth's paths dictating movement. Sensory details like damp stone and glowy thread are purposeful. The environment charges the final image of the restored labyrinth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early, and escalation is driven by Lira's agency in sewing and navigating. Cost is unmistakable in her physical effort and the transformation. Under the Accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges organically through images like threading and the final hymn. Subtext operates in the sleepwalking paths. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with a distinct poetic voice. Perceptual signature is consistent, e.g., tracing grooves and sensing memories. Elision like time folding is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
