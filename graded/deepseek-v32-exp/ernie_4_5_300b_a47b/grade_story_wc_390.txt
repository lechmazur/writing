<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied, with contradictory impulses acting in scene (e.g., his logical mind grappling with the key's emotional resonance). His final choice to harmonize rather than force is earned by prior causality, and the cost is visible in his physical collapse. The trait "logically emotional" is demonstrated through micro-choices under pressure, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (key stabilized, ghost vanquished) and felt cost (Elias's collapse and renewed vigil). The causal lens holds tightly, with because/therefore linkages driving the confrontation and resolution. Orientation is clear within the first 120 words, and the persistent constraint of the key's frequency shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina constrains choices (ice affecting movement and resonator use) and charges the final image with its sacred, balanced atmosphere. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's professional bias (e.g., "frosted planks," "ice-jumbled water"). The setting evolves causally with events, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the causal lens, from adjusting the resonator to confronting the ghost, with cost legible in his physical and emotional strain. The dominant stake (protecting the key) tightens through a meaningful turn (the ghost's appearance and dissolution), forcing a trade-off between force and harmony. No coincidental resolution; pressure coheres to the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of harmony between life and death emerges implicitly through events and images (e.g., the key as a bridge, sonic absolution). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through Elias's realization. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, such as the ghost's bowed departure, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (Elias's engineer mindset filtering sensory detail). Voice modulates under pressure (e.g., rhythmic control in climax), and any elision (like the key's history) is taught and paid off. Dialogue, though brief, is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in the ghost's crackled speech.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally (e.g., short, urgent clauses during conflict). Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, without muddle in peak beats. Grammar and punctuation are clean, supporting momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse engineering, sonic resonance, and spectral harmony feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in blending logical and emotional stakes heightens coherence without gimmickry. The core premise is organic, with details particular to this voice and setting.</comment>
