<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lira's face-blindness and texture-based perception are consistently embodied, driving her discovery and final choice to paint the constellations. Her motivation intensifies under pressure, and the shift from decay to preservation is earned with visible cost. However, internal contradictions are more sequential than simultaneous, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lira leaves with the safe, the portrait enduring as legacy; cost is legible in the tree's destruction and her altered purpose. Causal lens holds tightly from discovery to decision, with the coin and journal as persistent constraints shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—damp bark, old parchment—and constrains choices through the imminent demolition, charging the final image of the portrait. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, with the tree trunk library acting as a micro-setting that pressures action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes of preservation vs. destruction escalate through Lira's agency: her discovery of the journal forces a meaningful tightening, leading to the decisive painting choice with cost unmistakable in the wrecking ball's impact. Causal escalation narrows options credibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of legacy and limits emerges organically from Lira's arc and the guild's journal, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the constellation portrait. Subtext in "mirror the sky" deepens without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, texture-focused voice that reflects Lira's perception. Rhythm and diction control heighten pressure, and any elision (e.g., the coin's origin) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and vivid imagery ("fractally precise spirals"); no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Line-level craft supports momentum and closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes face-blind artist and hidden knowledge with originality, transforming tropes through specific detail. Risk-taking in the quiet, charged ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
