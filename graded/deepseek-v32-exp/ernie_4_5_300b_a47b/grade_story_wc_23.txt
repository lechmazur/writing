<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to navigate loss is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions like "tears streaking her dirt-smudged cheeks" and micro-choices such as building the antenna. Her final triumph feels earned through prior causality, though contradictory impulses are minimal. The cost of her effort is visible, satisfying the quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the reverse migration begins, costing Mara emotional release. The Hybrid drive lens holds, with causality tight from phone calls to antenna building. Orientation is clear early, and the censer foot's spinning at the end makes cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "rusted antennae clawing at the sky" and "smell of burning insulation."

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes around reverse migration escalate through Mara's agency under the Hybrid lens, driven by cryptic calls and antenna building.
