<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The queen's interiority is concretely embodied through specific actions like tracing the railing and tasting iron, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., climbing without hesitation). Her final understanding—"she looked at her hands... and understood"—is earned by prior causality, showing a credible endurance with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene when she bristles at the figure's lecture before acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the final image of her glistening hands and descent, reconfiguring her fear under a causal lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity, with the climb and confrontation narrowing options through motivated ellipsis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ember grotto functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice (e.g., the slick ridge alters tactics) and charges the final image with its bleeding light. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, such as the "ozone and something older" smell, filtered through the queen's urgency to mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from the climb to the confrontation, forcing a stance crystallization with cost legible in her understood fear. The dominant stake (internal conflict about fear) tightens meaningfully through the figure's challenge, narrowing options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the bleeding starlight as a mirror for internal struggle, with subtext in dialogue (e.g., "The starlight bleeds because you bleed"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the queen's silent understanding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "the stars sharp as pins") and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue with the figure carries subtext and advances plot, and purposeful elision (e.g., dream details) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "a lacy menace" is coherent and voice-motivated. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the climb, and the closure image remains clear with strong verbs and specific nouns.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The bleeding starlight concept offers a fresh synthesis of internal and external conflict, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric prose and transformative tropes (e.g., the grotto as wound) heightens stakes without gimmickry, supported by specific particulars.</comment>
