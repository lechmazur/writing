<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is clear and consistent, with functional creativity driving her choices under pressure. Interiority is concrete, but lacks deep contradictory impulses; final decision to refine the equation is earned, though emotional range is somewhat steady. Embodied emotion is present but not richly layered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual repricing via the projected equation, reweighting the premise with cost (energy redirection effort). Causal lens holds tightly from search to activation. Orientation is clear early, and persistent decay constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting vividly constrains choice—terminal's conduits and sextant piece are tactile resources that alter Lila's actions. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, charging the final image with moonlight and dust swirls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lila's agency under causal lens, from finding the sextant to redirecting flows, with cost legible in the terminal's shudder and hum. Stake—proving redirection of decay—tightens meaningfully, though secondary tension is minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of repurposing decay into hope emerges organically through events and the equation's projection, offering a resonant non-literal answer. Subtext in imagery avoids moralizing; final image reweights prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature blending engineering and poetic diction. No head-hopping; voice modulates with pressure, though dialogue is absent. Elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful; sentences advance story without muddle, especially in the activation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes sci-fi and literary themes with specificity—civil engineer repurposing spaceport energy into hope equation feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in conceptual repricing heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
