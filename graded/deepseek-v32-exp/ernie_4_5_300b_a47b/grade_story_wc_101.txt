<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot from observation to declaration. Her internal conflict with the council and embodied emotions, like brushing dust from the bell, reveal character under pressure. The final choice to reveal donors is earned by prior causality, with visible cost when donations cease but are replaced by open sharing. Contradictory impulses act in scene, and the renunciation of anonymity forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with resonant reconfiguration: the community shifts from hidden donations to open solidarity, costing anonymity but building trust. Causal lens holds strong, with Mira's actions driving because/therefore linkages. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible in the cessation of donations and emergence of notes. Persistent constraint of sanctions shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "red tiles glowing like embers" and "amplified quiet" filtering through Mira's POV. The terra-cotta arbor and antique bell constrain choices and charge the final image, as the bell evolves from silent relic to celebratory symbol. Environmental details mirror internal states and guide community actions, enhancing closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of community survival escalates through Mira's agency under the causal lens, as her declaration forces a trade-off between anonymity and solidarity. Cost is unmistakable when donations cease but are replaced by open exchanges, narrowing options and reweighting stakes. Pressure tightens meaningfully through her solstice speech, foreclosing the path of fear with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of intergenerational solidarity emerges organically from events and images, such as the bell's transformation and the mosaic of notes. Subtext operates in gestures and silences, like the widow's hand squeeze. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the bell's new purpose, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature evident in phrases like "amplified quiet" and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice remains coherent, and elision (e.g., tracing midnight food runs) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; dialogue, when present, is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language, such as "hope frayed like old rope," is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion advances story and character, and closure is sharpened by concise, image-driven lines.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Story synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh specificity, such as the bell's evolving role and the community's nuanced response to sanctions. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, and risk-taking in the quiet, declarative climax heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation through lived detail feels inevitable in hindsight, though slightly derivative in premise.</comment>
