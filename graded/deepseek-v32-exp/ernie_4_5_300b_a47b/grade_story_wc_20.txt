<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kael's interiority is concrete and contradictory, balancing logic and mysticism under pressure; his final acceptance of cracks is earned by prior causality with visible cost when he reaches for empty air.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as Kael accepts uncertainty; cost is legible in "his hand closed on empty air"; causal-hybrid lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice—the molten pit enables the pivotal action; sensory details like "rain drummed" and "smelled of iron" are selective and charge the final image with the coin fused into metal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency (dropping the coin) under the hybrid lens; cost is unmistakable in the loss of Lira's physical presence, narrowing options to acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mending through cracks emerges from kintsugi and name weight without moralizing; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via Lira's dialogue and the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with lyrical prose; perceptual signature reflects Kael's alchemical balance; dialogue carries subtext and advances plot without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold; figurative language like "woven from starlight and regret" is purposeful and clear in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of alchemy, zodiac coin, and kintsugi feels inevitable; risk-taking in mystical elements heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming familiar tropes.</comment>
