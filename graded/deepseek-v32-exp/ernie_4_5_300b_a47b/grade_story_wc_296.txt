<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply embodied with bark-rough hands and storm-cloud eyes, and her motivation to discover hidden truths drives the narrative. Internal conflict is shown through contradictory impulses, such as her guarded nature clashing with the urge to unbend, and her final acceptance of violence is earned through the vision's cost. The flesh-eating seed mirrors her hunger for truth, reinforcing her arc without diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change where Mira accepts her darkness and strength, with cost legible in her chest tightening and lighter heart. The causal lens holds tightly from her step into the vortex to the seed's eruption, and the frozen confession constraint shapes her tactics. Orientation is clear within 120 words, anchoring the cursed lake setting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The swirling orchard vortex actively pressures Mira's choices, constraining her entry and charging the final image of stillness. Sensory details like decaying fruit and ozone are selective and purposeful, filtered through her druidic POV. The vortex's evolution from chaos to respect mirrors her internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens: stepping into the vortex, releasing the seed, and facing the vision. The cost is unmistakable in her tightened chest and the seed's transformation, forcing a trade-off between ignorance and self-acceptance. The dominant stake of internal conflict tightens meaningfully through these actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of self-discovery emerges through concrete events like the seed's hunger and the frozen confession, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in Mira's realization that strength includes carrying darkness, reweighting prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext operates in the vortex's laughter and the seed's mirrored hunger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in Mira's storm-cloud eyes and bark-rough hands. Voice is poetic yet controlled under pressure, as in "trees twisted like dancers," and elision in the vision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift, with rhythm accelerating in the vortex sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with sentences doing multiple jobs like "the seed pulsed with a sickly green light, its hunger a constant, gnawing presence." No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; rhythm varies naturally, and closure image is clear. Information density is high without padding, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of druidic magic, flesh-eating seeds, and frozen confessions, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific choices like the seed seeking truth rather than food. Risk-taking in the vortex's warlike serenity heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional specificity avoids templates.</comment>
