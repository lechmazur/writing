<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority (e.g., "brush trembling") and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final choice to paint the shadows is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her artistic transformation. Contradictory impulses between duty and obsession act in scene, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the accumulative/textural lens holds with closure as Conceptual Repricing—Mara's understanding reweights the premise with cost legible in her transformed art. The phrase "map to the hush" echoes causally, and the window's persistent constraint shapes tactics. Closure lands on-page with felt cost in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details filtered through Mara's POV (e.g., "cold glass hummed"). The cathedral window as micro-setting constrains choices and charges the final image, directly shaping her discoveries and artistic shift. Economy and specificity support the narrative without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding nocturnal blooming) escalates under the accumulative lens through Mara's agency—tracing patterns, deciphering inscriptions—leading to a tightening choice in painting the shadows. Cost is unmistakable in her renunciation of static art and embrace of "umbral tenderness," foreclosing a path with visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the window's etchings and Mara's artistic shift, with subtext in gesture and image. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of "mysteries yet to unfold," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—Mara's artist lens colors descriptions (e.g., "fiery confetti"). Voice is poetic yet controlled, with rhythmic variation and purposeful elision (e.g., "reckon through hidden layers"). No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated (e.g., "walls themselves breathed"), and peak beats maintain clarity. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive, with no artifacts obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines through specific synthesis of art, legacy, and nocturnal botany, transforming tropes via grounded choices. Risk-taking in thematic depth and lyric resonance heightens stakes without gimmickry. The non-obvious angle on "reckoning" feels inevitable in hindsight, with bold commitment to premise.</comment>
