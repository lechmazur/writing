<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Veyra's motivations are clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through concrete actions like sifting debris. Her final choice to drop the camera wheel is earned by prior causality, demonstrating a credible renunciation with visible cost. Internal conflict is embodied in her interactions with the ghost, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) when Veyra drops the camera wheel and finds peace, with cost legible in her release from regret. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, and orientation is clear early. No causality breaks; the ending reweights prior material effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "bruised violet and electric gold" being selective and purposeful. Setting mirrors internal states and evolves with the plot, supporting tone and theme without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Veyra's internal conflict with regret, signaled early and escalated through her agency in confronting the ghost. Under the accumulative lens, a meaningful deepening occurs when she drops the camera wheel, foreclosing an option with felt cost. Pressure coheres until closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of letting go and time emerges through events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the rose and Veyra's departure, inviting reflection without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the ghost's softened expression.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic prose like "its waters churning in hues of bruised violet." Dialogue with the ghost is natural and goal-driven, advancing plot. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no major artifacts or loops. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "the sun hung like a stuck coin." Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs without obscuring clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements like the kinetic lagoon and disposable camera wheel form a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in surreal elements heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
