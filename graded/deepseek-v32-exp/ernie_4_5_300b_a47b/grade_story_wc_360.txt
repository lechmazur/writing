<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal his hierarchy of values. His change from detachment to empathy is earned through the climax, though Veyra feels slightly underdeveloped as a secondary character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly; closure is a decisive change with felt cost when Elias realizes emotions are "wildfires," and the fragment's energy transposes empathy. Orientation is anchored early, and the plot escalates coherently from his actions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "burnt sapphire and iron filings" filtering through Elias's POV. The halo fragment and workshop constrain choices and charge the final image, integrating seamlessly with the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start, escalating through Elias's agency in disorienting the fragment, leading to a reversal where he inhabits emotions. Cost is legible when his detachment crumbles, narrowing options under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of emotions versus mathematics emerges organically through events and imagery, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with Elias's realization, avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, and prose rhythm modulates with emotional pressure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with high information density, though minor overwriting in phrases like "lucid turbulence" slightly dulls peak beats. No major artifacts or loops harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of transposing empathy is fresh and synthesized organically with character and setting. Risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
