<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to harmonize discord is clear and consistent, driving her actions. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like her "fingers warmly attentive" to the feather. The final acceptance of transience is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the tapestry's dissolution. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; micro-choices under pressure reveal her values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the realization that "the act of creation mattered more than its permanence." The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through details like the kite string snap and weaving. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks. Cost is legible in the final image of the feather held to fading light.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "cobalt lagoon breathed softly" and storm debris constraining Lira's choices. The lagoon and objects (e.g., drake's feather) charge the final image and shape tactics. POV bias filters perception; spatial choreography is coherent. No generic or static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of harmonizing discord escalates under the accumulative lens through Lira's agency in responding to the kite string snap and tending to debris. Cost is legible in the transient tapestry and her acceptance. One meaningful tightening occurs when her song ripples the water, deepening the stake. No coincidence or resolution issues.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in transience emerges organically through events and images, such as the woven dawns unraveling. Subtext operates in gestures and implications, like the fisherman's nod. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic echo or abstraction; wisdom earned through concrete experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature reflected in phrases like "woven dawns" and "burnished hush." Voice modulates with emotional intensity, maintaining consistency. No head-hopping or register drift. Experimental compression is taught and legible, supporting closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; clarity is maintained even in peak beats. Syntax varies purposefully; word choice is specific and vivid. Read-aloud test passes with natural flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of familiar themes (transience, harmony) through specific details like the drake's feather and woven dawns. Risk-taking in quiet, lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test: the emotional arc is inseparable from the particulars. No derivative premise or template plots.</comment>
