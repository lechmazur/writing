<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied interiority (e.g., "throat tighten") and micro-choices under pressure. The final earned change—courage to face the unspoken—is supported by prior causality, though contradictory impulses are not deeply simultaneous in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost ("carry them forward, not as regrets"), under an accumulative/textural lens that holds. Orientation is clear early, and the gargoyle shard persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory-rich setting ("roots clawed at the sky") constrains choices and charges the final image as the labyrinth guides her exit. Specificity is purposeful and integrated with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (facing unspoken words) escalates through Lirael's agency (using the shard, reading messages) under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in the transformation of regret.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of healing and unspoken words emerges organically through events and images (spirits' songs, condensation messages), with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end that avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic perceptual signature and rhythmic control. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure, though dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with varied syntax, zero loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing propulsion without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (mangrove labyrinth, spirits, gargoyle shard) feels organic and inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
