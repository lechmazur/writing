<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's wistful hope and perseverance are consistently embodied, with internal conflict shown through her stay in the orchard. Her final sacrifice of the bead is earned by prior causality, with visible cost when she lets go, foreclosing a path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mara weaves silence into cloth, costing the beads. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with puzzle pieces accumulating to breakthrough. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The orchard and bamboo forest are vivid and purposeful, constraining Mara's isolation and supplying the creek box. The loom and amber bead function as micro-settings that charge the final image by shaping choices and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unraveling silence) escalates through Mara's agency with the puzzle, causing ripples and resistance. Cost is legible in the bead sacrifice, narrowing options under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice and communication emerges organically from images like the bead and loom, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer. No moralizing; subtext operates in silence and weaving.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, e.g., "sunlight dripped through leaves like liquid gold." Perception is character-specific, and rhythmic control heightens pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied rhythm, advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or overwriting; figurative language is purposeful, e.g., "stoically sparkling hues," and closure is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of silence, weaving, and puzzle feels inevitable, with risk-taking in accumulative structure. Emotional truth in sacrifice transforms tropes through specific choices.</comment>
