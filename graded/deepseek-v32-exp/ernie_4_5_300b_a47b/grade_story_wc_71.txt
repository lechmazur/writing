<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with concrete interiority and agency. However, the characterization lacks significant internal conflict or contradictory impulses under pressure, preventing a higher score. The final choice is earned but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a conceptual repricing where the hush becomes potential, reconfiguring meaning with undeniable cost under the accumulative/textural lens. The drive lens holds consistently, and orientation is clear early, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory details that constrain choice and charge the final image, as the bay amplifies the sanctification. The atmosphere coheres with the theme, and spatial choreography is clean.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early and escalate through Lira's agency in arranging displaced objects, leading to a legible cost in the transformation. Under the accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, though the conflict remains internal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events, with subtext in silence and potential, offering a resonant non-literal answer at the end. The conceptual repricing reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a strong perceptual signature in Lira's observations. Rhythmic control and purposeful elision support pressure, though minor ornate phrasing prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied syntax, advancing story without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and legible, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The concept of displaced objects and hush offers a fresh synthesis, transforming familiar tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in quiet narrative heightens stakes, though some elements feel slightly derivative.</comment>
