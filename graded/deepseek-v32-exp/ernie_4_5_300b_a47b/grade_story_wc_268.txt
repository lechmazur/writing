<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Veyra's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot, but interiority is limited with emotions told rather than embodied; no deep internal conflict shown on page, though her final choice is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (unmasking) and cost (chamber collapse), inferred causal lens holds strong; orientation is clear early, and structure is tight with coherent causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices (e.g., library shelves, trapdoor mosaic), charging the final image; sensory details are purposeful and integrated with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unmasking) escalates through Veyra's agency, with cost legible in the collapse and courtiers' reaction; one meaningful tightening under causal lens suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of truth and legacy emerge through events without statement; ending offers resonant, non-literal reconfiguration via the collapse and stellar resumption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with distinct, poetic voice; no head-hopping, and perceptual signature is consistent; dialogue is absent but narration is controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with good rhythm and density, but minor overwriting in dense phrases; no major artifacts or loops, and closure clarity is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elements (titan, ink pellet, library) feels organic and inevitable; risk-taking in poetic tone heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
