<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices like clutching the lattice. The final choice to "write" his story is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the lattice's bite and the chamber's shudder. Contradictory impulses act in scene during ghost interactions, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise with cost felt in the lattice clinking and walls dissolving, under a Hybrid lens that holds. The lattice as a persistent constraint shapes tactics, and orientation is clear early. No causality breaks; the figure's ambiguity serves thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the lattice as a micro-setting object constraining choices (biting palm) and charging the final image. Sensory details like "copperlight repose" are selective and POV-filtered, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the Hybrid lens, from stepping deeper to hovering and confronting the figure, with cost unmistakable in the lattice's warmth and chamber shudder. One meaningful tightening forecloses options, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events like the lattice as a pen, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to truth versus lies without moralizing. Subtext operates in the ghost's taunts and the figure's revelation, reweighting prior material at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature ("copperlight repose") and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue for the ghost and figure carries subtext, and purposeful elision (e.g., figure's identity) pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "lattice twisted like a question" is consistent and legible, even in peak beats, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in a fresh synthesis of the "cry wolf" trope with magical realism, transformed through specific details like the lattice as a pen. Risk-taking in lyrical non-linearity heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
