<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in spiritual curiosity and empathy. Her micro-choices, like walking to the impact site and placing the lantern, reveal her values under pressure. The final renunciation—empathizing with the star's death—is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her emotional release. However, slight lack of deep internal contradiction or flaws prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Zara's empathy liberates her and the stardust in the lantern reweights meaning. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with cost legible in the final image. Orientation is clear early, and causality is coherent without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly atmospheric, with selective sensory details (e.g., "crumbling plateau," "faded glow of ancient constellations"). The yellow lantern glass and star impact site function as micro-settings that charge the final image. POV filtering is consistent, and environment subtly mirrors internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal strength through vulnerability) escalates under the accumulative lens via Zara's agency in tracing the star's path and empathizing. Cost is felt in her release and the stardust's symbolism. One meaningful tightening occurs, but escalation is more gradual than sharp.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of strength in vulnerability emerges through concrete events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the stardust reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in Veyra's softened demeanor, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Zara, with a distinct perceptual signature and poetic voice. Dialogue is minimal but natural. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and elision (e.g., time blurring) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops or scaffolds; figurative language is consistent and purposeful. Read-aloud test passes, and closure image is clear without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept of a cosmic janitor empathizing with stars is fresh and non-obvious, synthesizing familiar ideas with specificity. Emotional truth avoids templates, and risk-taking in quiet plot heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
