<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira and Jorin are well-differentiated with clear motivations; Jorin's growth from fear to understanding is earned through micro-choices, though internal contradiction lacks depth in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing as Jorin realizes courage is a choice, not a place; Accumulative lens holds with cost felt in the return to vigil; ridgeway's indirect routes shape tactics consistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like salt and iron; the veiled ridgeway actively constrains choices and charges the final image through its shifting paths.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Jorin's agency under Accumulative lens; cost is legible in shared courage and the foreclosed path of direct demand, driven by encounters with travelers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from journey and imagery; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer on courage as a river without moralizing, reinforced by the ticket stamp's recurrence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively lyrical; dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit; perceptual signature remains coherent under pressure with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high density and rhythmic control; no loops or artifacts obscure closure; figurative language like "shimmered like a mirage" is purposeful and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Concept feels fresh and inevitable; the vigil and indirect routes synthesize into a unique stance risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, though close to familiar mentor-pupil tropes.</comment>
