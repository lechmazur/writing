<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her internal conflict. Her change is earned through the hellebore's metamorphosis, and her relationship with Mara applies immediate pressure. The final renunciation of control has visible cost, though minor diagnostic language in peak beats slightly reduces impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Eleanor releases control, with felt cost in her transformed perspective. The causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages from plant observations to her realization. Orientation is clear early, and the ending reconfigures options without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the nursery, trellis, and greenhouses constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Eleanor's POV, and the mossy trellis evolves to support the theme of transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Eleanor's agency under the causal lens, from the hellebore's retraction to her decision to release control. The dominant stake of control vs. transformation tightens meaningfully, with cost legible in her foreclosed path of strict management.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the linden leaf and hellebore, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on transformation through release. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, avoiding moralizing, and the final image reweights prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, and elision is taught and paid off in the closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and no figurative muddle in peak beats. Minor paraphrase loops exist but do not obscure closure, and rhythm supports scene needs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of plant metamorphosis as personal transformation is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in theme heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors emotional truth through particulars like the hellebore's change.</comment>
