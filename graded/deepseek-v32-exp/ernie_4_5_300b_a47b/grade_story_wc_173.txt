<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her actions; interiority is concrete through embodied dance and rebellion. However, the "chaste courtesan" aspect feels underutilized, leaning on label rather than deep exploration, slightly limiting character depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as echoes are freed and Lirael feels unburdened; accumulative/textural lens holds through gradual intensification of dance. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight, with no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly described with sensory details, but the courtyard and sanctuary serve more as atmospheric backdrop than active constraints on choices; they charge the final image but lack tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start, escalation is driven by Lirael's agency in dancing, and cost is legible in her unburdened spirit; one meaningful tightening under accumulative lens suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of defiance emerges through action and image, not statement; ending offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing, though some subtext could be deeper.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice consistently poetic, with distinct perceptual signature; no head-hopping or dialogue, and elision is purposeful, supporting the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lush and rhythmic, but dense figurative language in peaks risks overwriting; no major artifacts or loops, though minor clichés like "whispered secret" slightly reduce clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and synthesized uniquely, with risk-taking in lyric mode; transformation of tropes through specific details avoids derivative feel, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
