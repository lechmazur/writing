<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's traits are consistent and embodied, with clear motivation intensifying under pressure. However, internal conflict is minimal, and her kindness is stated rather than deeply tested through contradictory impulses, limiting peak emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strong with clear linkage from tape discovery to decoding. Closure lands as a decisive change with felt cost in Mara's new role, though the decoder's convenience slightly undermines earned causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory-rich setting constrains choices (e.g., pipe chases) and charges the final image with the "sapphire hush," achieving exceptional integration of environment and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is agency-driven under the causal lens, with Mara's investigation tightening stakes toward visibility. Cost is legible in her foreclosed anonymity and assumed responsibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of invisibility/guardianship emerges organically from events and the tape's message, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though slightly explicit in moments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature; dialogue (in tape playback) is natural and goal-driven, though minor ornate phrasing occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in descriptions (e.g., "sapphire hush" repetition) slightly dulls momentum without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crawl space dweller and analog tech tropes through specific details; risk-taking in sense memory concept heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
