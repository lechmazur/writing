<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's internal conflict is vividly embodied with contradictory impulses, such as fear versus duty, and her final choice to undergo metamorphosis is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in shedding humanity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with Lira's transformation, cost legible in the loss of her human self; Hybrid lens (accumulative-textural dominant) holds throughout, with the phoenix's appearance reconfiguring the bond.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard setting actively constrains choices, with sensory details like moonthorn scent and spice-paste shaping Lira's actions and charging the final image of rebirth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the Hybrid lens, from reluctance to acceptance, with cost unmistakable in her metamorphosis; stakes tighten meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of metamorphosis emerges organically from events and imagery, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through rebirth without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; lyrical prose reflects Lira's inner world, and elision (e.g., fortune echo) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, but slight overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "dormant hearts") prevents a higher score; no major artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of beast whisperer and phoenix mythology with sensory focus; transformation feels inevitable, and lyrical risks heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
