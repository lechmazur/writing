<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to discover intentions is clear and drives her actions, with a meaningful change earned at closure. However, interiority lacks deep contradictory impulses or fully embodied emotion under pressure, limiting peak complexity. Micro-choices like untangling the tapestry reveal values, but emotional progression is somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual repricing as Elara realizes the tapestry maps time, reconfiguring her role with felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through pattern and imagery. Orientation is clear early, and the tapestry acts as a persistent constraint shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the cobalt silo and tapestry constraining choices and charging the closure. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, integrating into action. The environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism, supporting theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes around discovering intentions escalate through Elara's agency in decoding the tapestry, deepening knowledge under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in her tempered smile and carried weight. One meaningful tightening forecloses options, though conflict remains low-key.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of echoes and time emerges organically from the tapestry's decoding, with subtext in whispers and echoes. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, as Elara becomes a gardener of time. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature. Prose rhythm and diction reflect Elara's mindset, and purposeful compression supports the accumulative design. No head-hopping or register drift, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with good rhythm, though slight overwriting occurs (e.g., "velveteen gloom"). Information density is high, advancing story without major loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is generally coherent and does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of cemetery gardener, silo, and temporal tapestry feels fresh and non-obvious, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth and conceptual integrity are strong, though not groundbreaking.</comment>
