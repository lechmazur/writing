<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation is clear and necessitated by the nostalgia ban, with embodied interiority and contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in her dance between fledge and anchor. Her final choice of elective exile is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the fading verse and unsteady legs. Micro-choices like using the moonstone dust reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise with Lirael's elective exile, reconfiguring her stance between earth and sky with felt cost in the verse's fading and memory's persistence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through descriptive density and pattern shifts like the garden's transformation. Orientation is clear early, and the moonstone dust serves as a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The twilight garden constrains choices by pulsing with a second heartbeat and shifting during her dance, while the moonstone dust charges the final image as a key catalyst. Sensory details are vivid and selective, filtered through Lirael's POV, with moss that sinks and stars that dim cohesively. Micro-setting elements like the stylus and moss alter tactics and support the accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Lirael's agency, intensifying from dance to verse-writing with a cadence shift that reweights the stake against the nostalgia ban. Cost is legible in the pain of writing and the verse's transient nature, narrowing her options to elective exile. The dominant stake of renewing constellations is signaled early and tightens through her embodied actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Lirael's balance between freedom and roots, with subtext in gestures like "obsidian grace" and the garden's fading. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through elective exile, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through particulars like the verse's memory and the cost of defiance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and third-person limited, with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature in rhythmic prose like "her body bent, twisted, and spun." Elision is purposeful, such as the taught pattern of observing gaps, and pays off in closure. No head-hopping; diction remains within Lirael's lexicon even under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language like "gravity became a suggestion" is coherent and voice-motivated, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Sentences advance story and atmosphere concisely, with strong propulsion through the dance and verse-writing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of tide dancing, nostalgia ban, and cosmic verse, feeling inevitable through specific grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming tropes of exile and defiance. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, as in Lirael's embodied yearning and cost.</comment>
