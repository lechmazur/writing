The final decision to stay forecloses his path of isolation with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as barriers dissolve and Kael stays, reconfiguring the concept of defense under a causal lens. Cost is legible in the farm's transformation and Kael's surrender. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity, with the barrier's fear shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The bioluminescent mushroom farm constrains choices through the permeable barrier and fungal column, charging the final image of spore rain. Sensory details are vivid and selective, filtered through Kael's POV, with spatial choreography coherent and setting integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the causal lens, from analyzing the barrier to activating the laser pointer, forcing a trade-off between control and surrender.

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of surrender as strength emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in Lira's dialogue and the barrier's intent-sorting.
