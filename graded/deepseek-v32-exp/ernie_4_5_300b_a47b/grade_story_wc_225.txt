<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Alaric's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His internal conflict between guilt and redemption acts simultaneously in scene, and his final self-forgiveness is earned by prior causality with visible cost, such as when he plucks the black thread and confronts his memory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page with a decisive change—the village unfreezing and Alaric's redemption—with felt cost under a causal lens that holds throughout. The orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of his guilt shapes tactics, as seen in the labyrinth's dissolution into light.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the platinum labyrinth and tapestry constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, such as the "platinum walls gleaming faintly," and the environment subtly mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Alaric's agency under the causal lens, with decoding the threads narrowing options and leading to a meaningful tightening. The cost is unmistakable in his realization that "some threads couldn’t be untangled—only woven into something new," foreclosing paths with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness and redemption emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement, with subtext in the threaded emotions. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the whole tapestry, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct with a poetic perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, such as "woven hush" and "fierce repose." POV is stable and single, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping, and any elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with zero loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is effective and coherent, as in "the woven hush—a tapestry of soundless forgiveness," and sentence rhythm varies naturally without obscuring clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes fantasy and introspection in a non-obvious way, with tropes transformed through specific details like the chess tutor's expertise applied to decoding. Risk-taking in blend heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
