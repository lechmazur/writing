<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; his observant nature and connection to ghosts compel higher-stakes choices. Interiority is concrete and embodied, as seen in his physical interactions with the environment and the mainspring barrel. The final engagement with ghosts is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the "weightless burden." No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost: Elias's understanding frees the ghosts, reconfiguring the meaning of cracks and elevator. Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory details and pattern analysis. Orientation is clear within 120 words. Cost is legible in the final image of the ghosts fading and Elias's tight chest. Persistent constraint of hidden stories shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (e.g., "cool metal," "dim, blue-gray haze"), filtering through Elias's professional bias. The abandoned circus ticket office pressures choices, such as climbing the counter to examine cracks. Environment constrains action and charges the final image, as cracks serve as emotional and physical portals. Spatial choreography is coherent, with dust patterns guiding discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of freeing trapped ghosts escalates through Elias's agency under the Accumulative lens, via dust analysis and hidden compartment discovery. Cost is legible in the "weightless burden" and ghostly gratitude. One meaningful tightening occurs when the plaster gives way, forcing a trade-off between repair and emotional engagement. Resolution earned by protagonist's alteration, with no coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of hidden grief and repair emerges through particulars like cracks, dust, and tickets, without direct statement. Subtext operates in gestures (clown ghost pointing) and imagery. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Elias's realization that "cracks in the façade weren’t just physical—they were emotional, historical." No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the ghosts' freedom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; Elias's observant voice filters details selectively. Prose rhythm varies with scene needs, from lyrical descriptions to tense discoveries. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., ghost whispers) is taught and pays off at closure. Dialogue is minimal but natural when ghosts speak, carrying subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; metaphors like "shadows stretch like old, thin hands" are coherent. Syntax varies purposefully, and clarity persists in peak beats. Read-aloud test passes with natural flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elevator repair, ghost-seeing, and horology feels organic and inevitable. Tropes transformed through specific choices (e.g., mainspring barrel as tool for measurement). Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration of cracks as emotional portals is fresh and non-obvious.</comment>
