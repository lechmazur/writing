<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her spatial imagination, driving key choices under pressure. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices like tracing the film grooves revealing character. The final resolve to uncover secrets is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her tears and the lilac scent. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with clear linkage from discovery to decision. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mara's resolve crystallizes, with cost legible in the tears and pulsing crystal. Orientation is anchored early, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like dust, decayed film, and rain, filtered through Mara's POV. The projection booth and film strip constrain choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear, and details integrate into action without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding unused love escalates through Mara's psychometry readings, driven by her agency. Pressure tightens as images reveal Elise's grief, leading to a decisive choice with cost in Mara's emotional response. One meaningful deepening under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unresolved love emerges through particulars like the film and letters, not direct statement. Subtext operates in gestures and implications, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through Mara's realization. No moralizing; complexity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "world as a lattice of memories." Voice is poetic yet controlled, modulating with emotional intensity. Dialogue is minimal but natural; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and clarity, with high information density and varied syntax. No major artifacts like loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful. Minor overwriting in peaks, e.g., "hushed thunder that matched the ache," but clarity intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of crystal gazing, psychometry, and vintage theater feels fresh and inevitable.
