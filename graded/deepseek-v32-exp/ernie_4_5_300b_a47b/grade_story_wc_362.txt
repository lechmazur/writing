<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her internal conflict between doubt and conviction is shown in scene, and her final renunciation feels earned by prior causality. The cost of her shattered assumptions is legible on the page, satisfying the quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost when Mara realizes the quartz mirrors emotions, reweighting the premise. The causal lens holds throughout, with clear because/therefore linkages from her actions to the revelation. Orientation is anchored early, and the constraint of the prism shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The quartz arbor and frost on the car window function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's POV, with the environment actively shaping her actions and the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens, from communing to the shattering of assumptions, with cost legible in the cracked glass and her realization. The dominant stake of proving her theory tightens meaningfully, foreclosing options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, exploring projection versus reality without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mara's revelation, reweighting prior material with complexity and ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; Mara's voice is consistent and rhythmically controlled under pressure. Purposeful elision in the frost patterns is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the shattering glass.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes familiar elements into a fresh, non-obvious angle through specific details like the prism and frost. Risk-taking in the lyrical closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
