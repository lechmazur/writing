<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion in micro-choices like tracing the crane's wing. However, internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, and the resolution feels more declarative than earned through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as the wing crumbles, fulfilling the prophecy under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, though the causal linkage is subtle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the brook and fireflies integrating into action. The nocturnal haven constrains choice by serving as the key site for the ritual, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early, and escalation is driven by the summoner's agency in mapping silence and placing the wing, narrowing options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible when the wing dissolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as a language emerges through events and images without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer, though it leans slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct with poetic rhythm, such as "terrestrially cosmic eyes." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with varied sentence structures, but minor overwriting like "terrestrially cosmic" causes slight register drift without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept of mapping silence is fresh and synthesized with character and stakes. Risk-taking in lyrical design heightens meaning without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
