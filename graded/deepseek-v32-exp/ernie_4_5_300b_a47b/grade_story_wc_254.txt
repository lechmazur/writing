<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation is clear and rooted in her aesthetic drive, intensifying to compel her paraphrasing action. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as feeling the quartz pulse in her bones. The final choice to step onto the liquid glass is earned by prior causality, showing a meaningful change with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lirael steps into the unknown, with cost legible in the ice cracking and her standing on liquid glass. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with sensory buildup leading to transformation. Orientation is clear early, and the lens is consistent throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices, such as the quartz colonnade humming and constraining Lirael's actions. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV. The environment charges the final image, with the atrium and lake integral to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lirael's agency under the accumulative lens, as her paraphrasing dissolves boundaries and causes the lake to crack. Cost is legible in the transformation, with a visible price in the reshaped world. The dominant stake of dissolving boundaries tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of boundary dissolution emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with Lirael stepping into the unknown, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in the paraphrasing and environmental changes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct poetic voice reflected in rhythmic prose and sensory perception. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, such as the paraphrasing action taught early. Voice coherence under pressure supports the closure effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing atmosphere without muddle. Rhythm varies naturally, and sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story synthesizes elements freshly, with a non-obvious angle on transformation through paraphrasing. Risk-taking in lyrical approach heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth and specificity avoid generic templates, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
