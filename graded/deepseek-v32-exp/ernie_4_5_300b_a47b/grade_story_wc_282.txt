<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and micro-choices that reveal her values. Her final transformation is earned by prior causality, though contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Lira realizes her role as a translator, with felt cost in her resolve. The accumulative/textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early, with the fossil's dissolution serving as a decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The coastal cave setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail, constraining choices and charging the final image. The environment pressures Lira's discoveries and integrates seamlessly with the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency with the heat-mapper, leading to a meaningful tightening as the fossil dissolves. Cost is legible in her resolve to awaken memories, under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and transition emerges through concrete events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext in the fossil's journey enriches without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Lyrical prose remains consistent under pressure, and elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of sensory mapping and transitional objects feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking that heightens stakes. Specific details anchor the premise without gimmickry.</comment>
