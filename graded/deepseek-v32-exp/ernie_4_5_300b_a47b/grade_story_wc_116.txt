<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The keeper's motivation is clear and intensifies through the journey, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction is subtle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in "their grip on reality now a faint echo." Orientation is clear early, and causality coheres through the swan's folds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the library and refuge constraining choices and charging the final image. Details like "bioluminescent fungi" and "petrified wood" are purposefully integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the Accumulative lens through the keeper's agency in following the swan, with cost visible in shedding self and loosening reality. One meaningful tightening occurs at the pool reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of witnessing without judgment emerges through events and images, not statement, with a resonant non-literal answer in the keeper's release. Subtext operates in silence and unraveling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is lyrical and consistent, with purposeful elision taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "become nothing and everything") but clarity and propulsion remain strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of internal journey and library tropes feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style heightening stakes. Specific details like the origami swan transform familiar material.</comment>
