<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marlow's characterization is deeply embodied, with calloused hands and a heavy heart driving his quest. His internal conflict between unspoken losses and the need to share grief is dramatized through micro-choices like returning nightly and writing the poem. The final renunciation—embracing grief as a door—is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the lantern's dimming and his decision to carve anew. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are filtered through specific, sensory details.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing via Marlow's poem redefining grief, with cost legible in the lantern's flare and dimming. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through repeated visits and imagery density. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the spectral mentorship's guidance tightens causality without breaks. The final image reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered through sensory details like damp earth and rattling glass, constraining choice by acting as a repository of memory. The greenhouse charges the final image as both prison and sanctuary, and micro-elements like the ribbon roll evolve meaning. Sensory hierarchy reflects Marlow's urgency, with perception narrowing under emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Marlow's agency in returning each evening and engaging with ancestral stories. The stakes—understanding collective grief—deepen through pattern breaks like the butterfly migration, reweighting options. Cost is unmistakable in his poem's articulation and the lantern's approval, foreclosing his isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the ribbon roll and family poems, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the grief-as-door metaphor, reweighting prior material without statement. Subtext operates in gestures and imagery, such as the butterflies mirroring poetry swirls, inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, reflective voice that modulates under pressure. Dialogue with the spectral voice carries subtext and advances plot, while perceptual signature is character-specific. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, such as the voice's origin, taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Minor figurative stacking in high-pressure beats (e.g., "shadows danced like restless spirits") slightly muddles clarity but doesn't obscure closure. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies naturally to support emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of gravestone carving, spectral mentorship, and butterfly migration, feeling inevitable in hindsight. The core concept transforms grief tropes through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure effect remains legible.</comment>
