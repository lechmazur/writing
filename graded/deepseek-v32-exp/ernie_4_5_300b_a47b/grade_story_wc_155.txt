<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to rediscover lost joy is clear and intensifies under pressure; her internal conflict between creating elegies and embracing hope is embodied in micro-choices like displaying the fragment, and the final renewal is earned with visible cost in her renewed energy and the community's revival.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal drive with clear linkages (finding fragment leads to display causing community engagement); closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the fog thinning and Lira's hopeful stance; the hybrid lens holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices (fog limits visibility, ruins shape scavenging); it charges the final image through the thinning fog and recurring objects like the fresco fragment, with sensory details filtered through Lira's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rediscovering joy escalates through Lira's agency in creating the display, which narrows options by challenging the fog's monopoly; cost is visible in the fog's retreat and her emotional shift, under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hope and memory emerges organically through events like the fresco discovery and community reaction; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, with subtext in light and fog imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is clear in Lira's attention to decay and light; dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet clear with high information density and rhythmic control; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic renewal with specific details like light-painting and knowledge network; risk-taking in lyricism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
