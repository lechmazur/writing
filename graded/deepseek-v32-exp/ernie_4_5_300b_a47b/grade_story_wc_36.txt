<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices. His final surrender is earned by prior causality, though minor told moments slightly reduce impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in the final image of rearranged markers, under a Hybrid lens. Orientation is clear early, and causality holds without breaks, making the Resonant Reconfiguration legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the canyon and chamber constraining choices. The flute and driftwood charge the final image, though some descriptions border on overwriting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency, from playing the flute to breaking it, with cost legible in the snapped reeds. Stakes tighten meaningfully under the Hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unmaking failure emerges through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, enriched by subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice remains coherent under pressure, though minor overwriting occurs in peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, but slight overwriting and mixed metaphors (e.g., "avalanchingly quiet") cause minor clarity issues in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh twists, like silence as power. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
