<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing the scarf and using hyperbolic geometry to access the story dimension. However, contradictory impulses are present but not deeply dramatized in scene, limiting the highest band. Final choice is earned with visible cost in the library's transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Eleanor accesses the story dimension, reawakening the library with felt cost. Causal lens holds strong from setup to payoff, with hyperbolic geometry as a persistent constraint. Orientation is clear early, and no causality breaks occur, though the transition to the corridor of mirrors is slightly abrupt but motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like Edison bulbs and the scarf's lavender scent, integrated into action and charging the final image. The library and scarf constrain choices, enabling the climax. Economy of detail supports momentum without clutter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled in Eleanor's restlessness, escalating through her agency in using hyperbolic geometry to reawaken stories. Cost is legible in the library's new vitality, and escalation under the causal lens tightens options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Themes of analog memories and the unseen emerge organically through events and images, such as the scarf and hyperbolic geometry, without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the poem and transformed library, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Eleanor's poetic and observational voice. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, and elision is taught and paid off in the closure. No head-hopping or register shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent, though slightly purple in peaks like "corridor of mirrors," but clarity remains uncompromised.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of librarian mysticism and hyperbolic geometry feels inevitable, with risk-taking in blending science and poetry that heightens stakes. Specific details like the scarf and theorem book avoid tropes, and closure is fully committed.</comment>
