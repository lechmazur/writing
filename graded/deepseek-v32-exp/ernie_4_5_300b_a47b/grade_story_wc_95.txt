<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's mechanical arm and Elyra's fierce diplomacy are embodied through micro-choices under pressure, with interior contradiction shown in their philosophical debate. The final collaboration is earned by prior causality, though Kael's evolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strong with clear orientation and closure as a Decisive Change—their shift to collaboration has felt cost (Kael's blood, yielded épée). The needle card's revelation drives the turn seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass atrium and brook actively constrain choices via light projections and sundial angles, charging the final image. Sensory details (prismatic shadows, water trickling) are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (questions as destinations vs. directions) escalates through agency-driven duel and map decoding, with visible cost (Kael grazed). Closure tightens options under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from duel and needle card recontextualization, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext thrives in dialogue ("I evolve").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV (Kael) with distinct perceptual signature; dialogue is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping, and elision (sundial's meaning) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without artifacts. Figurative language ("constellation of dots") enhances clarity in peak beats, and sentences advance momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dueling philosophers and hidden stellar map feels inevitable. Risk-taking in blending philosophy with physical action heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
