<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her truth-seeking nature, with embodied emotions like her breath hitching and throat tightening. Her micro-choices, such as tracing graffiti and playing the accordion, reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final shift to drawing a heart map is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her trembling hands and raw solace.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when she sees "Begin," reweighting her journey with cost legible in her smile and step away. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the mosaic of graffiti messages coheres into a meaningful pattern that pays off at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like damp earth and ivy, constraining choices by guiding Mara's discoveries. The station as a liminal space charges the final image of the glowing graffiti, and POV bias filters details through her professional focus on rivers and archives.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of self-forgiveness escalates through Mara's agency in deciphering graffiti, leading to a deepening realization that healing requires surrender. Cost is legible in her tightened throat and tremors, foreclosing stagnant guilt for a flowing path, though external conflict is minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from graffiti messages and Mara's actions, offering a non-literal answer through the river metaphor without moralizing. Subtext operates in implications like "forgiveness isn't a destination," and the final image of "Begin" reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic prose and selective attention to river-related details. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, such as the raw edge after stopping meds, and elision (e.g., graffiti wisdom) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with varied sentence structures and vivid imagery like "ivy clawed at the brickwork." No loops or artifacts obscure clarity; figurative language is coherent and supports momentum, even in peak beats like the final realization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of river chronicler and graffiti archive, transforming tropes through specific details like the patched accordion. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight, with no derivative echoes.</comment>
