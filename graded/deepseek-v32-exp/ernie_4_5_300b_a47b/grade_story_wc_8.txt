<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; her final choice to recontextualize truth is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and embodied, such as when her "pulse quickened" at Tomas's riddle, showing micro-choices under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the noble lie is reweighted as a necessary compromise, with cost legible in the inscription "Truth is not a weapon. It’s a seed." The causal lens holds tightly from investigation to revelation, and the rosebush's demise persistently constraints tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The railway station's ivy-choked setting constrains choices (e.g., the tunnel discovery) and charges the final image of truth growing. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like the "damp earth and old wood" smell, filtered through Elara's professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens, from examining the letter to uncovering the tunnel, with cost unmistakable in the shifted dates revealing the war's delay. The dominant stake of truth versus lies tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the rose and key symbols, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through Elara's decision to write history as a "cautionary parallel." No moralizing; subtext operates in implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a reflective, historical tone that modulates under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in Tomas's emotionally rational speech, but brief convergence in peak beats slightly limits distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is purposeful, e.g., "brickwork softened into greenish folds," and propulsion remains clear through closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes historical investigation with the concept of noble lies in a fresh, non-obvious way, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in thematic depth heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
