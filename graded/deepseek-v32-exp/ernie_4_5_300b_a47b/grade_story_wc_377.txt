<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve wonder is clear and consistent, driving her choices from mute vow to sculpture building. Interiority is concrete through actions like cradling the iceberg, but internal contradiction is minimal, limiting depth. Her final bell strike feels earned by prior causality, with cost in the melting ice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative lens, with cost legible as the iceberg melts and symphony transforms. Orientation is anchored early; structure is coherent with one meaningful tightening. The persistent constraint of the fragment shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the bluff and bells constraining choices and charging the finale. Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered, such as the "liquid light" notes. The iceberg fragment as micro-setting alters tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes of preserving wonder escalate through Elara's agency in building the kinetic sculpture, under an accumulative lens. Cost is visible in the melting ice and transformed symphony. One meaningful deepening occurs as the fragment shrinks, foreclosing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, like the bells painting truth. Subtext operates in silence and implication. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the transformed symphony, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature focused on sound and beauty. Voice is poetic and consistent, with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is integrated and clear, even in peak beats like the "glisten" triggering the symphony. Syntax accelerates with scene needs without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh, specific details like the iceberg fragment and kinetic sculpture. Emotional truth is specific, and risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
