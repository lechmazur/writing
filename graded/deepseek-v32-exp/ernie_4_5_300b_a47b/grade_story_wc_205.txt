<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and intensifies, with interiority shown through embodied actions like covering mirrors and planting seeds. His final stance as a planter of doubt is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his "burnished sorrow." The defunct revolutionary background informs his methods without over-explanation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the fungi's bloom and societal doubt. Causal lens holds tightly from covering mirrors to vision to evidence. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of Council control shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting pressures choices via temporal storms and bioluminescent fungi, which constrain Kael's actions and charge the final image. Sensory details like "shimmering cobalt haze" are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the causal lens, from covering mirrors to facing heresy, with cost legible in the Council's accusation and fungal evidence. The dominant stake (truth vs. lies) tightens meaningfully through his choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through events like the mirror metaphor and fungal symbols, offering a resonant answer without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material with "courage to see what mirrors hide," avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic signature, reflected in phrases like "sharp as regret." Elision (e.g., poetic logic for covering mirrors) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; voice modulates under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("slow fuse," "palimpsest") is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats. Sentence variety supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of archaeological dispute, temporal storms, and memory hoarding feels inevitable. Risk-taking in poetic logic (covering mirrors) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details like bioluminescent fungi anchor freshness.</comment>
