<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion (e.g., hands trembling) and a final choice earned by prior causality. Her internal conflict and micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values, though her flaw of single-mindedness is somewhat underdeveloped. The closure cost is legible in her commitment to her father's mission.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly with because/therefore linkages from inciting incident to closure. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and closure lands as a decisive change with felt cost in Elara's commitment. The microdot specs as a persistent constraint shape tactics and the final image, enhancing coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (e.g., fog, storm) that pressures choices and charges the final flare signal. The lighthouse environment constrains Elara's isolation and resources, directly affecting the plot. No generic or static description; spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Elara's purpose and legacy) escalates through her agency under the causal lens, with a meaningful tightening in the safehouse discovery. Cost is legible in her renewed commitment, though external stakes remain somewhat abstract. No coincidental resolution; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of open secrets and legacy emerges organically through events and images, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Elara's action, reweighting prior material. Subtext in fortunes avoids moralizing; earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is consistent and character-specific, though dialogue is minimal and functional. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (e.g., fortunes) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language (e.g., "carved through fog like a silver blade") is coherent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion advances story; no register drift or clarity issues in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise of a fortune cookie writer manipulating fate is transformed through specific details and character choices. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in structure and tone heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivative echoes; authenticity of vision is strong.</comment>
