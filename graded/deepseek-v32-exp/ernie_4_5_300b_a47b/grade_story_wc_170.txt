<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation is clear and rooted in her sister's memory, with embodied emotion shown through actions like tracing condensation and humming. Her perceptively calm demeanor contrasts with internal weight, creating credible contradiction. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in her sweating and heaving chest. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the mirrors hold possibilities and the sister smiles, reconfiguring meaning with felt cost in Lirael's exhaustion. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The locket and effort shape tactics persistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like wet stone and jasmine, woven into action. The prism parapet and mirrors constrain choices and charge the final image, acting as micro-settings. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details reflect Lirael's POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (persuading mirrors) escalates through Lirael's agency under the Accumulative lens, with cost legible in her sweating and quickened pace. The mirrors' responses deepen possibilities, narrowing options emotionally. No coincidence resolves; pressure coheres through sensory density.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory and possibility emerges through images like the locket and coded lullabies, without direct statement. The ending offers a non-literal answer with the sister's smile, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and rhythmic, modulating with pressure. Elision (e.g., "coded lullabies") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction remains within Lirael's lexicon, even under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story and atmosphere without loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("colors bleed") is coherent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion matches scene needs, with clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Concept of a mirage painter using sound and shadow is fresh, synthesized with emotional specificity. Tropes are transformed through grounded details like the borrowed heartbeat. Risk-taking in lyric design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
