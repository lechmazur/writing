<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is strong with clear motives and interiority, though contradictory impulses are not deeply dramatized. Her "precisely playful" trait is stated but could be more constrained in choices. The final integration of foresight and hindsight is earned through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost felt in Mara's transformation; the hybrid lens holds. Orientation is clear early, and the decaying directive persistently shapes tactics. The final image of her stepping out reconfigures meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and charges the final image; the vine-draped bunker and rewilded forest mirror internal states and constrain choices. Sensory details like bergamot scent and storm sounds are purposeful and integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the hybrid lens through Mara's agency with the seal and dreams, leading to a cost-legible redefinition of paths. One meaningful tightening occurs, though pressure could be more intense in middle beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to why paths choose walkers. Subtext in dreams and decay enriches without moralizing; the ending reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic rhythm and perceptual signature. Experimental elements like hologram dialogue are legible; elision in dreams is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high density and varied rhythm with clear propulsion. Minor overwriting in phrases like "precisely playful" occurs, but no loops or artifacts harm closure; figurative language is coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of decay and renewal feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details like the wafer seal and rewilded forest avoid derivative premises.</comment>
