<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as a heart contact tracer, with persistent curiosity driving micro-choices under pressure. Her final action to reassure the woman is earned by prior causality, and emotions are embodied without stock phrasing. Minor hairline slip in slightly over-articulated interiority at peak beats, but closure choice has visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Lila delivers the message, reconfiguring the woman's grief with felt cost in the emotional weight and hearing aid's beep. Under a Causal lens, events are tightly linked through Lila's actions. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the pulses shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like mist and moss, and the atrium functions as a micro-setting that constrains Lila's navigation and charges the final image. The environment pressures choices and supports tone without generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lila's agency under the Causal lens, from tracking the pulse to finding the hearing aid, with cost legible in the emotional resolution and beep. The dominant stake of protecting vulnerable voices tightens meaningfully, and the climax forces a trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of love enduring beyond death emerges through events and images, with subtext in unspoken words and the reassurance. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, and the core concept of incidental heroism integrates seamlessly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Lila's poetic, atmospheric voice. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present, and elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats. Minor overwriting in phrases like "spectral cats" but does not obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The concept of a heart contact tracer using a hearing aid is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in mystical elements heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
