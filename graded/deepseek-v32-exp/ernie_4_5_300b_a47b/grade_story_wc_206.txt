<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias and Lira are well-motivated with embodied emotions; Lira's admission of truth is a key micro-choice that drives closure, though Elias's omniscience slightly limits internal contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (Lira's emotional admission); causal lens holds tightly with orientation anchored early and the philosopher's stone's constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Resonance chamber and tools like obsidian needles constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elias's agency and Lira's confession, forcing a trade-off with clear emotional cost; one meaningful tightening under the causal lens drives the resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth as healing emerges through concrete events and the final image of the music box playing "the truth"; no moralizing, with resonant subtext in Lira's admission.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with a distinct lyrical voice; dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though minor register consistency in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or scaffold, but slight figurative richness in some lines slightly tempers clarity without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of magic realism and moral repair; premise feels inevitable with risk-taking in lyrical style and conceptual depth that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
