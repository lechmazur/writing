<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in childhood curiosity, intensifying under pressure. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions and micro-choices, such as sifting through debris and burning the film negative, revealing a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost when she accepts the legacy's burden.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible when Lira burns the film negative and hears "You are the map." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory details and thematic resonance. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the legacy constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details like "damp stone" and "wet earth and iron." Setting is integrated into action, mirroring internal states, and the environment pressures Lira's discoveries, making it indispensable to the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the Accumulative lens, through finding diaries and the wall shift, narrowing options. Cost is visible when she burns the film negative, foreclosing a path. The dominant stake of discovering walls' dreams tightens meaningfully, with no coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of legacy and memory emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in objects like the film negative and locket. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting prior material without moralizing, through Lira's realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic diction and rhythmic control. Voice is consistent under pressure, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping. Elision is taught and paid off in closure, enhancing the accumulative effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, such as "the corridor’s echo had found its voice," without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of a corridor echo cartographer and living architecture offers a fresh synthesis, transformed through specific details like the film negative and diaries. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
