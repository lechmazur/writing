<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final choice to read the stanza is earned by prior causality, though the "nervously confident" trait is underutilized in constraining actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost ("some truths were worth the risk") under a causal lens, driven by Clara's agency. The copper nail and jet stream shift create persistent constraints that shape tactics, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "spongey gray sky" and "salt and ozone" filtering through Clara's POV. The weather station and nail constrain choices and charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Clara's agency under the causal lens, from decoding stanzas to digging and the roof confrontation. Cost is legible in the risk taken, and stakes tighten with the jet stream shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of reversible exile and legacy emerges through particulars like the nail and journals, with subtext in margins. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, and voice remains coherent under pressure. Minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, and propulsion remains clear even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of weather lore and exile reversal, transformed through specific details like the coded stanzas. Risk-taking in the climax heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
