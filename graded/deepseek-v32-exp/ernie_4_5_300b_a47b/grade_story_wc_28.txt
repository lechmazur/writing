<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His retrocognitive flashes create internal conflict, and the final symbolic act is earned with visible cost, though the abstraction slightly limits peak intensity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with felt cost in the tessera's transformation. Orientation is clear early, and the retrocognitive constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (shattered sky, ash) are selective and purposeful. The tessera as a micro-setting object constrains choice and charges the final image, integrating seamlessly with character perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake of rebirth vs. ruin escalates through Elias's agency under the accumulative lens; cost is legible in the symbolic renaming that forecloses despair. No external conflict, but internal deepening is sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of mercy and transformation emerges through particulars like the tessera, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity, though the "aberrant mercy" mantra borders on explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is consistent, and rhythmic control supports pressure. No dialogue, but elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied syntax; figurative language is pattern-taught and enhances closure. Minor overwriting in peaks, but no loops or artifacts harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic hope through symbolic acts; specificity in details like the tessera avoids tropes. Risk-taking in quiet narrative heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
