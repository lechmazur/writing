<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied emotion (trembling hands, gaunt face) and micro-choices under pressure. The final reimagining is earned through his persistent efforts, though contradictory impulses are present but not deeply explored in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with Conceptual Repricing—the ghost town revival via memory—with felt cost (tears, salt spray). Inferred accumulative/textural lens holds; orientation is clear early, and causality builds through memory fragments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details (lanterns, salt-laden air) filtered through Elias's POV. The amber bottle constrains choice and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (reimagining civilization) escalate through Elias's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in his emotional investment and the town's transformation. One meaningful tightening occurs, but escalation is more gradual than sharp.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of revival through memory emerges organically from events and images, with a non-literal, resonant answer at the end. Subtext operates through the bottle as lens, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, lyrical voice and perceptual signature. No dialogue, but prose rhythm and diction are controlled under pressure, with purposeful elision in memory work.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and legible, even in peak beats like the revival scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of alchemy, memory, and ghost town revival feels inevitable, with risk-taking in accumulative structure. Specificity in details (amber bottle, working memory) avoids template plots.</comment>
