<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and micro-choices driving the narrative; her shift from control to witness is earned through prior causality, though internal contradictions could be more simultaneous.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost (tears, terror); the accumulative lens holds strong, and orientation is immediate within the first paragraph, with the curse shaping tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and actively constrains choices, such as the frictionless water forcing rock sequences; the aurora and bluff charge the final image, integrating seamlessly with Lira's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Lira's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in her emotional turmoil; one meaningful tightening occurs as visions fracture and eels respond, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Lira's struggle, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of eels forming a sigil; no moralizing, and subtext operates in gestures and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively poetic, with rhythmic control enhancing the accumulative texture; no head-hopping, and elision is taught early, though dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without obscuring clarity, with varied sentence rhythm and high information density; no loops or scaffold issues, and figurative language is purposeful in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh synthesis of elements like eel herding and precognitive curses, with risk-taking in accumulative structure; specificity anchors universals, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
