<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in grief and atonement, with concrete interiority shown through actions like tracing the stencil and folding origami. His emotional progression is embodied and contradictory, avoiding stock phrasing. The final choice to embrace grief as a language is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his transformed state. No diagnostic label-speak or unmotivated leaps.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the accumulative/textural lens, closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elias finds purpose, reinforced by the stencil's inscription. The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and cost is legible in his "quiet, burning certainty." Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the mosaic structure (shards of past and present) is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "cold stone floor" and "rustled telescopes" filtered through Elias's POV. Micro-settings (stencil, origami) evolve tactically, shaping his rituals. Specificity is purposeful, avoiding generic description, and the dome's glow becomes a beacon that reweights the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Elias's internal conflict with grief) escalates through his agency under the accumulative lens, as lighting lanterns and leaving origami deepen his understanding. Cost is legible in his emotional shift and the physical toll ("fingers bled"). One meaningful tightening occurs when the shadows reveal the curtains as invitations, foreclosing isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of mending and transformation emerges through particulars like the stencil and origami, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the inscription "Light the way," reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in symbols, and emotional honesty avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic prose that mirrors Elias's grief. Voice modulates under pressure (e.g., "subdued thrill"), and elision (like the wife's death) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift; diction remains character-consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Syntax varies purposefully, and clarity is maintained even in dense passages like the description of the curtains.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements (curtains of intention, origami coordinates) feels organic and non-obvious, transforming grief tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in symbolic narrative heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure image is inevitable in hindsight. Authenticity of vision is clear.</comment>
