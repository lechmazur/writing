<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in her past failure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final realization is earned through causality, though the epiphany feels slightly swift, costing a hairline deduction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly; closure is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in the final image of ignited resilience. Orientation is clear early, and the note discovery tightens options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral, with the fortress and fire-lilies constraining choices and charging the climax. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Lira's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the causal lens, from following rumors to igniting the lilies, with cost legible in her realization. One meaningful tightening forecloses her hopelessness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resilience and hidden potential emerges through events and images, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext in the note and flame filtration deepens without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical yet controlled, and elision (e.g., mentor's disappearance) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density, but minor overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "tapestry of color") slightly dulls peak beats. No loops or artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fireworks design and mystical resilience feels inevitable; specific details like the kerosene knot transform tropes. Risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
