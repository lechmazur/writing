<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lila's motivation to collect silences is clear and drives the narrative; her emotional arc from loss to hope is earned through specific events like the doll's loss and the sprout's appearance, with contradictory impulses of fear and anticipation acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as the sprout reconfigures hope after the doll's loss, under a Hybrid lens; the gravity inversion persists as a constraint, and orientation is anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bunker and trellis are vividly detailed and constrain Lila's choices, charging the final image with the sprout; sensory details like "taste of rust" and "silence flavors" are purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Lila's agency, such as clinging to the trellis and losing the doll, with visible cost; the dominance of her desire for freedom tightens under the Hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of silence and growth emerge organically, with the sprout offering a resonant, non-literal answer to confinement; subtext operates through images like the "gilded hush" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic diction reflecting Lila's perception; elision is taught and paid off, though minor convergence in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high density and varied rhythm without loops; minor overwriting in phrases like "stretching contracted possibilities" does not harm closure, and propulsion is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of collecting silences and gravity inversion is fresh and synthesized with emotional depth; risk-taking in lyric closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
