<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her investigation and realization. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as her "calloused hands and a mind like still water." The vision of her past self adds depth, and her final choice to carry the lesson forward is earned. However, internal conflict is subtle rather than sharply contradictory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the plot builds through imagery and revelations, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where Mara's understanding reweights the premise. Closure lands with cost as she departs, carrying the oasis's lesson. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is vividly specific and integral, with the oasis and sunflowers constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "horizon bled orange" and "air tasted of ash" are purposeful and filtered through Mara's POV. The environment actively shapes the narrative arc and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on understanding resistance to entropy, escalating through Mara's discoveries and visions under the accumulative lens. Her agency in attention and realization drives deepening, with cost legible in her departure. One meaningful tightening occurs as the visions reconfigure her perspective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events, exploring kindness, memory, and timelines without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Mara's realization and the final image of her potter's wheel. Subtext is rich in elements like the phototropic lantern glass and sunflowers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical, zen-inflected prose. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and purposeful compression (e.g., vision sequences) is legible. No head-hopping or register drift; diction aligns with Mara's character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with strong information density, advancing story and atmosphere. Minor figurative stacking in high-pressure beats (e.g., "jagged shadows that danced like ghosts") slightly muddles clarity but doesn't harm closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts; sentence-level propulsion is effective.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of wasteland, beekeeping, fractured timelines, and phototropism feels fresh and inevitable, transforming familiar tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Conceptual integrity is maintained throughout.</comment>
