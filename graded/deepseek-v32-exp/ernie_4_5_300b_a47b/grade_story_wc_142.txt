<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's dual allegiance is concretely embodied through micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing the chip along the mural and organizing the graffiti. Her internal conflict between order and chaos drives credible irrationality, culminating in an earned stance crystallization at the climax. The final endurance forecloses a path with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise with felt cost in the final image of the carnival "still afloat, its chaos tempered by purpose." The causal lens holds tightly from inciting incident (decoding graffiti) to climax (Council confrontation). Orientation is anchored within 120 words, and the stone chip's persistent constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The raft city setting actively pressures choices, such as the Alley of Whispers constraining Lira's movement and the graffiti serving as a tactical resource. Sensory details like "fried dough and diesel" are filtered through POV bias. The environment charges the final image by mirroring the resolved tension between chaos and order.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency in reorganizing the graffiti, which narrows options and forces the Council confrontation. The cost is legible in the unresolved fight and the "flicker of hope." Under the causal lens, one meaningful tightening—from decoding symbols to public advocacy—forecloses live options with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between chaos and order, avoiding moralizing. The final image reweights prior material through the stone chip's smooth edges and the carnival's "unwritten but possible" future. Subtext operates in graffiti symbols and Jax's fire-eating, offering a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, such as Lira noticing graffiti as "encoded messages." Dialogue between Lira and Jax is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in climax beats, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, such as the opening sentence anchoring voice and stakes. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates during the Council confrontation without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The culture shock absorber role and floating carnival premise offer a fresh synthesis of gentrification tropes. Risk-taking in visual language reorganization heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, making the resolution feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
