<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative through her methodical actions. However, interiority lacks deep contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure, with emotions often described abstractly rather than viscerally. Micro-choices reveal her values, but the absence of significant internal conflict limits complexity. The final success feels earned but with minimal personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as the trumpet's note heartens the community, costing Lirael's patience and effort. The accumulative lens holds strong, with mosaic shards taught early and transitions legible. Causality is maintained through her method, though some discoveries feel slightly convenient. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph, waiving any penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory details like "ivory harbor glistened after the rain" and the trumpet valve as a recurring object that charges the final image. The environment pressures choices by guiding Lirael to sites of absence. POV filtering through her archivist perspective ensures purpose and consistency. Spatial choreography remains coherent across locations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mending fractured history escalates through Lirael's agency under the accumulative lens, with density increasing as fragments coalesce. Cost is legible in the time and patience invested, foreclosing easier paths. The resolution is earned through her active choices, though the stakes remain more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of history as a mosaic emerges organically from Lirael's actions and the trumpet's symbolism, avoiding direct moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the symphony, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures like the valve's return, though the final paragraph leans slightly explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, such as "ocean-spray archivist," and perceptual signature shaped by Lirael's role. Dialogue from the fisherman and girl feels natural and advances plot. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, with no head-hopping or register drift. Elision in her method is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "fractured like shattered glass" is purposeful and clear. Sentences advance story and atmosphere seamlessly, with no artifacts obscuring causality. The closure image is sharp and unobstructed by line-level issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of an archivist mending history through staggered intervals is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details like the trumpet valve and ivory harbor anchor originality, avoiding template plots.</comment>
