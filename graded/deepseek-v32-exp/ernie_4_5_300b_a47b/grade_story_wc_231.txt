<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's eccentricity and motivation are clear and consistent, driving the investigation. His final choice to return memories is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in carrying others' burdens. Interiority is concrete, though minor stock elements in his portrayal prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Elias commits to returning memories, under a causal lens that holds throughout. Cost is legible in the final image, and orientation is clear early. No causality breaks, but minor predictability in the revelation slightly limits impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly atmospheric with selective sensory details that enhance mood. The opal dock and hatch constrain choices, charging the final image. However, the environment doesn't fully pressure tactics beyond mood, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate coherently under the causal lens, from mystery to moral dilemma, driven by Elias's agency. Cost is visible in his decision to bear others' burdens. One meaningful tightening occurs, but the escalation lacks multiple reversals for higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of isolation and borrowed memories emerges through events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in gestures and silence enriches, but slight explicitness in dialogue limits depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control. Dialogue feels natural and advances plot. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off. Minor overwriting in descriptions does not harm clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with high information density and varied syntax. Figurative language is mostly coherent, though minor density in metaphors and a template cadence in places prevent a higher score. No major artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept of borrowed memories is fresh and well-integrated, transforming tropes through specific details. Emotional truth and risk-taking in structure heighten stakes. Synthesis feels inevitable, but not fully groundbreaking for the highest band.</comment>
