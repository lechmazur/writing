<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Clara's motivation is clear and intensifies through embodied emotion (e.g., hands wrapped around kettle, tracing wood grain). Internal conflict between grief and creation acts simultaneously in scene, and the final choice to carve is earned by prior causality (husband's note) with visible cost in emotional labor. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orientation is clear within 120 words; Accumulative/Textural lens holds with closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Cost is legible in the final image of the carved lion holding light, and the persistent constraint of grief shapes tactics. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory (rain-beaded skylight, damp wool), filtered through POV. The loft and carving tools constrain choice and charge the final image, with micro-setting (ash wood) altering tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (processing grief) escalates under Accumulative lens through protagonist agency in carving, deepening understanding. Cost is unmistakable in the emotional labor and time invested, foreclosing raw grief with a visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of loss as transformation emerges organically from particulars (carving, memories), with subtext in gesture and image. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (lyrical, reflective voice). Rhythmic control under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., time as mosaic) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with clear propulsion in peak beats (e.g., carving sequence). No artifacts obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief and creativity through specific details (lion tamer, ash wood). Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
