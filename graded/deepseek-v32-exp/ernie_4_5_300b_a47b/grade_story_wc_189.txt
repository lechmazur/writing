<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as chronicler is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as feeling the pulse in ripples; final choice to plant the seed is earned by prior reflections on transition, with cost in the relationship tension easing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under accumulative/textural lens, closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) where the pause reconfigured with potential; cost is legible in Kael's softened expression and the tide's turn; orientation is clear early, and lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the grotto and jade cicada constraining choices and charging the final image; details are POV-filtered and integrated into action, such as the pool's cold seeping into skin mirroring internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (relationship conflict) is signaled early; escalation under accumulative lens occurs through Elara's agency in using the tangential approach, with cost legible in Kael's curiosity and the paused argument's resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transitions emerges organically from particulars like the cicada and tide; subtext operates in gestures and silence; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the cicada and sea, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and controlled, with rhythmic prose; dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in Kael's curt responses.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peaks; sentences advance story and atmosphere with propulsion, such as the description of the grotto.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of transitions, chronicler role, and tangential approach feels inevitable; specific details like the jade cicada and tidal pools create freshness; risk-taking in quiet, reflective style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
