Interiority is concrete, with micro-choices under pressure, such as hesitating before acting. The resolution is earned by prior causality, though emotional embodiment could be slightly deeper in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with cost legible in the diamonds dissolving and farm stabilizing.

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preventing implosion escalates through Dr. Voss's warnings and unstable diamonds.
