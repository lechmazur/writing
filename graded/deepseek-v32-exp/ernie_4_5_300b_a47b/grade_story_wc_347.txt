<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and internal conflict under pressure. His final choice to guide the traveler is earned by prior causality, with visible cost when he risks the birds and the curse. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; micro-choices reveal his values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Kael successfully guides the traveler and locks the door, satisfying the curse with cost ("the labyrinth shuddered"). Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages. Orientation is clear early, and structure is coherent in a single scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the labyrinth and mechanical birds pressuring choices. The nut as a recurring object constrains tactics and charges the final image. Details are selective and integrated into action, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (avoiding the curse) escalates through Kael's agency under causal lens, with cost legible when he braces against the birds. Pressure tightens meaningfully, and resolution is earned by his actions, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of duty and sacrifice emerges implicitly from events and images, with subtext in Kael's reluctance. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the satisfied curse and shifting labyrinth, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature filtered through Kael's urgency. Voice is consistent and rhythmic, though not exceptionally so under peak stress. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise and vivid with high information density, advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Figurative language like "paths twisting like veins" enhances without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing cursed orchards and mechanical birds with emotional truth. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
