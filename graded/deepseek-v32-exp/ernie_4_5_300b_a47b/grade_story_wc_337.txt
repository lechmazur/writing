<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as a broken mask restorer, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her internal conflict (fear vs. determination) and earned change to lucidity are compelling, though the transformation feels slightly rapid for the word count.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the net unravels, revealing the key and Mara's newfound lucidity, with felt cost (weight lifted). The accumulative/textural lens holds strong, and orientation is clear early on.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary and fisherman's net function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, with the net's accumulation of silence directly shaping the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency in unraveling the net, under the accumulative lens, with a meaningful tightening as silence breaks. Cost is legible in the burst of light and weight lifted, though stakes remain somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence versus truth emerges organically through events and imagery, with subtext in dialogue ("silence isn't always kindness"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; dialogue is natural and goal-driven. Prose rhythm and diction remain consistent under pressure, with no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is cohesive and purposeful, with clear propulsion in peak beats like the net's unraveling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes familiar tropes (ghost story, restoration) with fresh specifics (interlaced hush, prism sanctuary). Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
