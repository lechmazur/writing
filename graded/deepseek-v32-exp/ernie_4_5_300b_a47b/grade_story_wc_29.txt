<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion (e.g., hands trembling) and micro-choices under pressure (calibrating frequencies). Her final interference is earned by prior study, but lacks deep internal contradiction, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise—Lila ready for the next round—and cost is legible in the community's softened division and the tricksters' note. Causal lens holds tightly from action to outcome, with persistent constraint shaping the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (radio station, basement) is vividly specific and constrains choice (e.g., oscilloscopes used for calibration). The environment charges the final image as a hub for the unknown, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lila's agency under the causal lens, with a clear stake (proving signals) and cost (community tension softening). The gamble with subsonic frequencies narrows options meaningfully, though the resolution feels slightly swift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of power plays emerges through events and subtext (e.g., the tricksters' note), with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Avoids moralizing, but the note's explicit language slightly reduces depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct—technical yet poetic ("wind chimes made of starlight"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with no head-hopping; elision (e.g., the voice crackle) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no major artifacts. Minor scaffold in phrases like "cautiously hopeful" repeats, but clarity and propulsion are maintained, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes cosmic and academic elements with originality; the celestial signal interpreter role and subsonic method feel fresh and indispensable. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
