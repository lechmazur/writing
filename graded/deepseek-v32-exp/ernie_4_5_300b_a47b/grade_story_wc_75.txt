<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is clear and intensifies, driving key choices like hosting the festival and teaching children. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, though internal contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced. The final choice to bake and sing is earned by prior causality with visible cost in effort and hope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the community's revival and Lila's resolve. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through motifs like the lens and bread. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of dying arts shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail filtered through Lila's POV. The grotto city and objects like the lens and oven constrain choices and charge the final image, reinforcing theme and stakes without postcard staticness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake in rescuing dying arts escalates through Lila's agency under the Accumulative lens, culminating in the festival decision. Cost is legible in her efforts and the community's engagement, narrowing options from neglect to action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like baking and singing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to cultural preservation. Subtext operates through images and gestures, avoiding moralizing while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is lyrical yet precise, and any elision (e.g., the beekeeper's absence) is taught and paid off without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, and peak beats maintain clarity and propulsion, such as in the final oven scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of elements like the grotto setting and opera lens, transformed by specific character choices. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
