<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that lead to an earned final decision with cost; her retrocognitive gift creates credible internal conflict, though some aspects of her identity fraying are summarized rather than fully dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change and felt cost when Mara triggers the trapdoor; causal lens holds throughout with clear orientation and no breaks, though the antagonist's sudden appearance is slightly convenient but not causality-breaking.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details integrated into action; the zeppelin setting is unique but less pressure-exerting after the opening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mara's agency, with a meaningful tightening when she faces her own death and chooses to act; cost is legible in the loss of the codex and her acceptance of ongoing conflict.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive with high information density; no significant loops or artifacts, and rhythm supports pressure, though a few phrases border on overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements like retrocognition and zeppelin library feels inevitable in hindsight; bold risks with the setting and abilities heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
