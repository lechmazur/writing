<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. However, internal contradiction is minimal, lacking simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene, which prevents a higher score. Her final endurance is earned but not deeply conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost (Lira's exhaustion and the realm's revival) under an accumulative/textural lens, with the mica windows and humming reconfiguring stakes. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, making the ending resonant and legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the alchemical orchard and mica windows constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency through humming forgotten songs, increasing density under the accumulative lens and reweighting stakes with visible cost (her exhaustion and the night fraying). The dominant stake of rekindling the realm tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer ("through forgotten songs, we remember how to live") without moralizing. Subtext operates through implication and repetition of motifs like woven dawns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that modulates under pressure. Voice remains consistent, and elision (e.g., the child's melody) is taught and paid off in closure, enhancing rhythmic control without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in metaphors (e.g., "fruit that glowed like captured stars") slightly reduces clarity in peak beats. No major loops or artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept synthesizes memory, light, and song in a fresh, non-obvious way, with risk-taking in accumulative design that heightens stakes. Specificity in details like the mica windows makes the premise indispensable and transformative.</comment>
