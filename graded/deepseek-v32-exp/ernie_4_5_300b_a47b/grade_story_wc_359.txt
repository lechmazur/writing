<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's synesthetic gift and motivation to certify wonder are concretely embodied and drive her choices under pressure, such as pressing the amber sheet to her lips and singing; her final success earns closure with visible cost in the cavern's transformation and Veyra's change, though minor lack of contradictory impulses in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the cavern's voice unfettered and Veyra's awakening, felt cost in the resonant hum and shared wonder; causal-accumulative hybrid lens holds from Lira's song to the sculptor's response, with orientation anchored early and no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice cavern setting constrains Lira's actions and charges the final image with trapped light and melting ice; sensory details like frost spiraling and resinous scent are selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV to mirror internal states without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of certifying wonder escalates through Lira's agency under the hybrid lens, her song tightening options and deepening cost as the ice shifts and Veyra transforms; the climax reweights stakes with undeniable price in the cavern's exhale and shared laughter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wonder as essential emerges through particulars like the aurora's colors and sculpted hush, not statement; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer in the harmonious singing, avoiding moralizing but with minor abstraction in the final line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Lira's synesthesia; voice is poetic and controlled under pressure, e.g., "silence pooled like indigo ink," and elision like the amber sheet's use is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "frost spiraled like ghostly breath" is purposeful and coherent, though minor overwriting in peak beats slightly mutes clarity without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of prism-song and synesthesia feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in lyric prose heightening stakes; specific details like the amber sheet and sculpted hush transform familiar tropes through grounded choices in character and closure.</comment>
