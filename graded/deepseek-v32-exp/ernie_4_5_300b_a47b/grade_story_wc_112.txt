<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Veyra's motivation is clear and rooted in curiosity, with embodied emotions under pressure (sweat, fogging visor). Her competence and struggle during the crisis show credible flaws, and the final choice to reach for the lever again is an earned endurance. However, some emotional moments are summarized rather than fully dramatized, slightly reducing impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise with felt cost in the near-disaster and Veyra's awakened curiosity. Causal lens holds strong from her actions to consequences. Orientation is clear early, and the structure tightens meaningfully with one reversal (destabilization). Cost is legible in the thrashing creatures and her stabilization effort.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (ammonia clouds, lavender glow) and constrains choices, such as the nexus affecting the environment. The station's "icy warmth" atmosphere charges the final image of Veyra's determination. Sensory details are purposeful and integrated into action, enhancing the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving time moves sideways) escalates through Veyra's agency: lever pull causes awakenings, destabilization forces recalibration. Cost is visible in the creature's thrashing and her quick response. One meaningful tightening occurs, but the resolution relies slightly on quick fixes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of non-linear time emerges through events and imagery (time "stretch like taffy"), not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with Veyra's curiosity awakened. Subtext in the director's words enriches without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature ("icy warmth," "time stretch like taffy"). Voice is poetic yet controlled under pressure. LUX's dialogue is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and variety, with high information density. Minor overwriting in phrases like "mechanically warm precision" causes slight figurative muddle, but no major artifacts or loops. Closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise is fresh with non-obvious synthesis of xenobiology and time manipulation. Specific details (magnetic nexus, subdued awakenings) transform tropes. Risk-taking in poetic language heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
