<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with micro-choices like working through the night and defying Hale revealing her hierarchy of values. Interiority is concrete, though Hale's characterization is slightly flat. The final choice to upload coordinates is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise, reconfiguring stakes as Lira resolves to find the gateway, with cost legible in the drones advancing. Causal lens holds tightly from clues to revelation, and orientation is clear early. The recurring numbers shape tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the archive's cold light and holographic interface constraining choices. The patch and recurring numbers charge the final image, acting as micro-settings that guide Lira's actions and deepen atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the causal lens, from investigating numbers to cracking encryption, narrowing options. Cost is unmistakable in the alarm triggering and drones advancing, foreclosing safety with visible risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus erasure emerges through events like deleted files and Elara's video, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Lira's resolve, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending tech lexicon and urgency. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in Hale's oily lies, and elision (e.g., encrypted video) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and no major artifacts. Minor issues like "brightly attentive" repetition don't harm closure, and rhythm supports pressure in peaks like the encryption crack.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing corporate espionage and sci-fi mystery with specific details like the patch and numbers. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, and risk-taking in the charged poise ending heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
