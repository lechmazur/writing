<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lila's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure, such as unclasping the pendant, revealing contradictory impulses of fear and hope. Elias serves as a catalyst, but his characterization remains secondary, though functional. The final choice to let Elias stay is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the pendant's lightening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory and emotional density. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lila's realization that "healing wasn’t about erasing the past but letting it breathe" lands with cost in the pendant's lightened weight. Orientation is clear early, and the drip pattern persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the server racks as anchors and the drip pattern guiding Lila's actions. The moss garden charges the final image with the sapling planting, and sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Lila's internal conflict between grief and growth, escalating through her agency in unclasping the pendant and adding moss. Under the accumulative lens, density increases with emotional beats, and cost is legible in the fear relinquished and the pendant's transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of grafting new meaning onto wounds emerges through concrete particulars like the pendant and orchids, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in the image of "threaded with orchid roots and server hum," avoiding thematic echo or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature, such as Lila noticing the "honeyed hush." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with subtext in Elias's gestures. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with zero loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent, e.g., "the garden’s hum became a language," and sentences advance story and atmosphere without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes data center and moss garden with emotional specificity, transforming grief tropes through unique details like the amber pendant and drip pattern. Risk-taking in quiet tone heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
