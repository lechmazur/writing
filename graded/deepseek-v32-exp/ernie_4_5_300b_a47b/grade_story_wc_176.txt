<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, with embodied emotion (trembling hands, raw hands) and micro-choices under pressure. His renunciation of fire for light is earned, and interiority is concrete, though minor lack of contradictory impulses in scene prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lira's figure materializes, costing Kael physical effort and emotional release. Accumulative/textural lens holds, with orientation clear early and causality tight from rope manipulation to climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective (glacial stone, aurora), with the ceremonial rope and punched card as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Kael's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving memory) escalates through Kael's agency under accumulative lens, with cost legible in his raw hands and emotional intensity. One meaningful tightening occurs as the rope reconfigures, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and loss emerges through particulars (rope, card, names) without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Lira's apparition, reweighting prior material with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (poetic, sensory-rich voice). Rhythmic control under pressure, and elision (forgiven past) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and serves atmosphere, though minor density in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (lost wax caster, punched card, ceremonial rope) feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric accumulative design that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation of tropes through specific detail.</comment>
