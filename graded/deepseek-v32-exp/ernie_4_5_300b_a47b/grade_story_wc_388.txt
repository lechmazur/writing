<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, evolving from truth-seeking to survival, with interiority shown through concrete actions like reassembling letters. Her final choice to seal the stillpoint is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the orchard's change and her walked-away hope. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; micro-choices under pressure reveal her values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly with because/therefore linkages from investigation to climax. Closure is a decisive change on-page: sealing the stillpoint alters the orchard and wasteland, with cost legible in the diamond's sacrifice and radiation drop. Orientation is clear early; no plot amnesia or convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "radioactive grit" and "dust storms" filtering through Mara's POV. The orchard center and diamond chamber constrain choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; details evolve with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preventing dimensional collapse) escalates under causal lens through Mara's agency, from discovery to climax. Cost is unmistakable in the diamond's sacrifice and altered orchard. One meaningful tightening forecloses options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth vs. consequence emerges from events, not statement, with subtext in the diamond's curse as consequence. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through the sealed stillpoint and hope, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—analytical and observational, fitting a truth excavator. Prose has rhythmic control; no head-hopping or register drift. Elision in clues is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and vivid, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story efficiently. Closure beat is clear without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic mystery and metaphysical concepts, transformed through specific details like the stillpoint and diamond. Emotional truth in Mara's journey; risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
