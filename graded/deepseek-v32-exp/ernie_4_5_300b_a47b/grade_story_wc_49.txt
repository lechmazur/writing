<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to restore magic is clear and drives key choices, with embodied emotion in her aching hands and damp cheeks. However, interior contradiction is underdeveloped, and some emotional descriptions lean generic, such as "tears of joy" implied rather than concretely shown. The final community involvement is earned but lacks deep internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as magic is restored and Lira commits to tending, with cost legible in the spent tendril and her exertion. The causal lens holds strong from Lira's actions to the outcome, and orientation is clear early. The forest spirit's gift is a minor deus ex machina but is set up and does not break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "vials of glowing pollen" and "streams singing," and the arbor actively constrains choices by hosting the ritual. The vine tendril and lyre charge the final image as key objects. Some description borders on overwrought but remains purposeful and integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes around restoring magic escalate under the harvest moon, driven by Lira's agency in playing the lyre, with cost visible in the tendril's dissolution and her physical effort. The tightening is meaningful and coherent under the causal lens, though the conflict lacks intense internal friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of awakening magic through community emerges organically from events like the golden stories and creature dances, without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material with the sapling symbolizing ongoing care, offering a resonant non-literal answer. Lira's grandmother's words are slightly explicit but earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with whimsical diction, though it occasionally flirts with purple prose. Dialogue from creatures is natural and goal-driven, enhancing subtext. No head-hopping, and elision is purposeful, but perceptual signature could be sharper under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with strong rhythm and high information density, advancing story without major loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off in closure, though some phrases like "liquid gold" are slightly cliché. Momentum remains clear and propulsion effective.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The combination of tinkerer, forest magic, and golden stories feels fresh and specific, transforming familiar tropes through grounded details. Emotional truth is present, but the premise leans on well-worn harvest moon motifs without significant risk-taking. Synthesis is cohesive but not highly innovative.</comment>
