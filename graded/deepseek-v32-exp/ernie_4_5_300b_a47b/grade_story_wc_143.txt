<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with "purposefully curious" embodied in her actions, such as decoding notes and setting the vial. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion like trembling gloves, and micro-choices under pressure reveal her values. The final endurance and renunciation are earned, but minor lack of internal contradiction in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing via the archived photo and later discovery, reweighting the premise of human care against cosmic indifference with felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through details to the resonant image. Orientation is clear early, and causality is intact with no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the moonlit summit and crater constraining choices through time pressure and drone arrival. Sensory details like "glow of her suit’s headlamp" are selective and POV-filtered. The vial and environment charge the final image, essential to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of documenting the "last of something precious" escalates under accumulative lens with drone countdown and dawn approach. Lira's agency in setting the vial narrows options, and cost is legible in her foreclosed role. However, escalation is more textural than causal, limiting peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of legacy and human care emerges through particulars like the sand grain and photo, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the archived discovery, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, but minor thematic echo in "outlasted indifference" slightly reduces freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "the moon wasn’t a conquest. It was a mirror." Prose rhythm and diction reflect Lira's mindset under pressure. No head-hopping or dialogue, but voice remains coherent and evocative throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffold issues. Sentences advance story and atmosphere, e.g., "A soft chime echoed in her helmet." Figurative language is purposeful, and closure image is clear without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of space age twilight with personal legacy feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like the chemical message. Emotional specificity and risk-taking in quiet ending heighten stakes, but premise echoes familiar automation narratives, limiting peak innovation.</comment>
