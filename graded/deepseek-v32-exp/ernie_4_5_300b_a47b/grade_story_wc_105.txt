<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in personal history, driving her actions consistently. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as frowning at the shimmering world. The final choice to create and use the hearing aid is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in hearing "the absence where love should be." However, contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene, limiting the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Lira achieves her goal, and the cost is legible in the final image. The causal lens holds tightly, with each step—collecting absences, adding the root—driving the outcome. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraints like the forge shape tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the sunken greenhouse and forge constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as the "ghostly static" and "neon glow." The dead peach tree and root are micro-settings that directly alter tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the causal lens, from collecting absences to adding the root, intensifying pressure. The cost is unmistakable in the "scream of glass shattering" and the final silence. Stakes are clearly signaled and tighten meaningfully, foreclosing options with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like absences and shipwrecks, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Lira hearing "the silence between heartbeats," reweighting prior material without statement. Subtext operates in imagery and implication, enriching complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature tied to Lira's synesthesia. Diction and rhythm control heighten pressure, as in "a muted symphony of lavender static." Elision is purposeful, such as the father's backstory, and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing multiple elements. Minor overwriting occurs in dense metaphors like "spectral light... like liquid mercury," but no loops or artifacts harm clarity. Propulsion remains strong, especially in the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes memory, sound, and absence in a fresh, non-obvious way, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in concept and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details like the hearing aid designer and forge are irreplaceable and integral to closure.</comment>
