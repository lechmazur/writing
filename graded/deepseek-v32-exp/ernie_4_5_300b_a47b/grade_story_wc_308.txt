<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion shown through the warming arrowhead and hardened resolve. His internal conflict between stillness and movement is dramatized, and the final realization is earned by prior causality. However, contradictory impulses are not strongly acted in scene, limiting the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost—Kael's understanding that navigation requires alignment, not stillness—under the accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the pulse as a persistent constraint shapes tactics. The cost is legible in the final image of him carrying secrets forward.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting of bone towers and echoing canyon constrains choices, such as the birds' patterns guiding Kael's realization. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through his POV. The environment charges the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the accumulative lens, through the birds' figure-eight pattern and the arrowhead's pulse, leading to a deepening that reweights stakes. Cost is visible in his weathered resolve and the foreclosed path of mere stillness. One meaningful tightening is sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the birds' cycles and arrowhead's history, offering a non-literal answer to navigation without moralizing. Subtext operates in echoes and patterns, and the ending reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in Kael's rhythmic, poetic observation. Voice modulates with pressure, and elision (e.g., time transitions) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though minor density in high-pressure beats prevents a higher score. Closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh, specific details like the harmonic stone skimmer and pulse, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the quiet, conceptual ending heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional truth anchors originality.</comment>
