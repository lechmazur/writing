<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in embodied emotion, with micro-choices under pressure revealing her hierarchy of values. The final detachment is earned by prior causality, showcasing internal conflict and a credible change with visible cost. However, minor hairline slips in emotional progression prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lira embraces freedom, with felt cost legible in the island's disappearance. The accumulative lens holds strongly, and orientation is clear early. The persistent constraint of the disappearing island shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the sublittoral fringe constraining Lira's choice to enter the water. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, charging the final image. The environment actively pressures decisions, but slight generic elements in the island description hold it back from perfection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the accumulative lens, with the whale's call and detachment tightening stakes. Cost is unmistakable as the island crumbles, foreclosing her past. A single meaningful deepening is sufficient, though the escalation could be more pronounced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of letting go emerges organically through events and symbols like the scrimshaw, with subtext in implication. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the theme occasionally edges toward overt symbolism in the scrimshaw's role.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Lira's state. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping, but minor register consistency issues in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, though slight rhythmic monotony appears in descriptive passages. Closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of elements like the disappearing island and whalebone scrimshaw, transforming tropes with specificity. Risk-taking in lyrical approach heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, but the concept has echoes of familiar myths.</comment>
