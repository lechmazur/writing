<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her vows and love for Mara, with embodied emotion shown through actions like climbing and mending. Interiority is concrete, but the absence of on-page relationships limits depth; however, her micro-choices under pressure (e.g., mending the quartz eye) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in her persistence, though contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with clear because/therefore linkages: the breach motivates Lira's persistence, leading to the orchard's bloom. Closure is a Decisive Change with Resonant Reconfiguration, as the mending reconfigures her legacy with cost legible in the orchard's transformation. Orientation is anchored early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, though the cost is more positive than punitive, slightly limiting impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the orchard in the cathedral constraining choices (e.g., climbing rafters) and charging the final image through the blooming trees. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as crunchy fruit and whispering leaves, integrating environment into action. The micro-setting (quartz eye) also alters tactics, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (keeping the orchard alive) is signaled early and escalates through Lira's agency in mending the eye, narrowing options under the causal lens. Cost is visible in her effort and the orchard's renewal, foreclosing other paths. However, the escalation lacks a major reversal, relying on one meaningful tightening, which fits scope but limits higher band entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of persistence and generational wisdom emerges organically from events and images like the hair ribbon and vows, with subtext in implication rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the orchard's bloom, avoiding moralizing. However, some thematic echoes (e.g., "accidental wisdom") lean toward explicit articulation, slightly reducing subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, lyrical voice reflective of Lira's perception; syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional intensity, such as in the climbing and mending beats. No dialogue, so voice coherence is maintained throughout. Purposeful compression in reflection anchors present micro-choices, with no head-hopping or distance issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, e.g., "leaves whispering secrets," though minor clichés appear. Read-aloud flow is smooth, and closure beat remains clear, but lacks the exceptional density for 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise is original and ingeniously synthesized, with the quartz-eye mender and cathedral orchard offering a fresh angle. Tropes are transformed through specific details like liquid starlight and deciduous vows, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure image recharges prior material.</comment>
