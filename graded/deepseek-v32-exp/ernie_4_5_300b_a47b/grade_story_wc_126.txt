<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied perception (e.g., "fingers tracing the cracks"). Her micro-choices under pressure, such as using the mendicant's bowl, reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final stance crystallization is earned by prior causality. Minor lack of strong internal contradiction, but closure choice is credible with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the silence becomes a "threshold." Cost is legible in the transformed silence and communal response, and the bowl's reweighting shapes the final image. Structure is tight with one meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the greenhouse's acoustics constraining Lira's choice to play the violin, charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered (e.g., "glass amplified the drip of condensation"). Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment evolves causally with the music.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding beauty in grief) is signaled early and escalates through Lira's agency in using the bowl to play, transforming the silence under the Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in the communal offerings and changed atmosphere. One meaningful tightening forecloses the prior stagnation with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars like the bowl's transformation and music, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to beauty in ruin without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and image (e.g., offerings in the bowl). The final image reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "acoustically perceptive" filtering detail). Voice is poetic yet consistent, and elision (e.g., the wanderer's backstory) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; dialogue, when present, is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated (e.g., "glass cathedral"). Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and closure image is clear. Minor elegance in peak beats but no obscurity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic elements with specific, grounded choices in character and object use. The mendicant's bowl and acoustic perception transform familiar tropes through lived detail. Risk-taking in tone heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
