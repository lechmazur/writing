<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in empathy, with concrete interiority and embodied emotions. His final choice to merge timelines is earned by prior causality, though his "resiliently positive" trait could be more deeply tested under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as the ferry dissolves and Kael stands alone, under a causal lens with coherent linkages. The hourglass and radio shape tactics, and the cost is legible in the dissolution and tears.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The spectral grotto and starlight are vivid and selective, with sensory details that pressure choices (e.g., grotto pulsations guide radio tuning). The environment constrains action and charges the final image of the Hourglass constellation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early, escalating through Kael's agency in broadcasting the pattern. The merge forecloses options with visible cost in the ferry's dissolution, driven by protagonist choice under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of completion and transience emerges through particulars like passengers' stories and the hourglass, with subtext in whispers. The ending reweights prior material without moralizing, via the eternal Hourglass image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature. Dialogue (Kael's transmission) is natural and goal-driven, and elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and dense with no loops or scaffold; figurative language like "liquid starlight" is purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs without obscuring clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise offers a fresh synthesis of time travel tropes through specific details (hourglass, radio patterns). Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
