<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lirael's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotions like "felt a ache" and micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing shadows, earning her shift from archivist to participant. Contradictory impulses between archiving and participating act in scene, and the final renunciation of her old role is motivated by prior causality with visible cost in her lighter steps.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds coherently, with closure as a conceptual repricing where Lirael reweights her identity; cost is legible in the final image of her "lighter" descent and the crystal's hum. The solid fog constraint shapes tactics, and orientation is clear early, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details like "frosted glass" and "crystalline silence" filtered through POV, constraining choices via shadow distortion and crystal vibrations. The environment charges the final image where memory lingers, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake in identity escalates under accumulative lens through Lirael's agency in conjectures and measurements, narrowing options to participatory role. Cost is unmistakable in her foreclosed archival path, driven by protagonist choices without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and identity emerges organically through images like solid fog and shadows, with subtext in vibrations; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material via Lirael's realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in poetic observations like "memory's breath," and rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping, and elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "poured milk" is coherent and purposeful, with clear propulsion and no muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of collective memory with identity formation feels inevitable through specific details like shadow examination; risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and transformation avoids template plots.</comment>
