<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cedric's motivation crystallizes clearly from trauma to active pursuit; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion like "fingers trembled" and "shivering bliss." His final choice to descend feels earned by prior causality, and the cost is visible in the greenhouse's dissolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—the greenhouse dissolves into a new reality—under a causal lens that holds tightly from program discovery to string unsnapping. Cost is legible in the "crumbled ruins" and transformed self, with orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "scent of moon-petals" and "luminescent leaves," constraining choices as the vines pulse and machinery grinds. The greenhouse charges the final image, evolving from stasis to unraveling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Cedric's agency: reading the program, murmuring allegiance, and unsnapping strings tighten pressure meaningfully. Cost is unmistakable in the machinery's scream and reality shift, foreclosing old paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, culminating in the resonant, non-literal insight that "possibility is a dance." The final inscription reweights prior material without moralizing, supported by subtext in the allegiance and program.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a mystical, descriptive texture like "factually mystical" and "shivering bliss." Rhythmic control under pressure is strong, though minor convergence in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold; figurative language like "reality shifted like heat haze" enhances clarity. Momentum remains high through closure, with only hairline slips in register.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of knight, alchemical greenhouse, and marionette theater feels inevitable in hindsight, transforming tropes through specific choices. Risk-taking in mystical elements heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
