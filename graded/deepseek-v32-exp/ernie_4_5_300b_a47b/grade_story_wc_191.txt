<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as lore keeper, with micro-choices under pressure like using the ruby flake and questioning the guardian. The final renunciation of sitting on the throne is earned through prior causality and carries visible cost. However, contradictory impulses could be more dramatized in scene rather than summarized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost (stairway collapse, self-realization), and the causal drive lens holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and time pressure persistently shapes tactics. The guardian's challenge integrates seamlessly into the arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the orchard and murals constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss. The environment actively guides Lira's path.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled and escalate under causal lens through time pressure and guardian encounter. Lira's agency drives tightening choices, with cost legible in the stairway's collapse. The resolution is earned by her alteration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of self-realization emerges organically from events and images, with the final mirror-throne offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in guardian's dialogue and Lira's realization, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fantasy and philosophical elements, with tropes transformed through specific details like the throne as metaphor. Risk-taking in the ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
