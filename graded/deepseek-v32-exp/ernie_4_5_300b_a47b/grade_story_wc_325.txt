<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lira's claustrophobia and motivation are consistently embodied and drive key choices under pressure, such as when she forces focus despite panic. The final renunciation—accepting proof over reunion—is earned by prior causality with visible emotional cost. Minor diagnostic self-awareness in phase transition reflection is brief and anchored in present action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where cables as memorials reconfigure meaning with felt cost in tears and salt. Orientation is clear early, and the tide constraint shapes tactics. The gold fleck's use aligns with established rules, and the brother's signal revelation pays off setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting pressures choices through flooding and claustrophobia, with sensory details like "moss-slicked concrete" and rising water altering tactics. The facility constrains the climax and charges the final image of emergence. Specificity is selective and POV-filtered, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (finding brother's proof) escalate under causal lens via rising tide and Lira's agency with the gold fleck. Cost is legible in her raced pulse and waist-deep water, forcing a trade-off between discovery and survival. One meaningful tightening forecloses easy options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of invisible memory emerges through particulars like the gold fleck and cables, not statement. The ending reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity—cables as "memorials"—without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like clutching the codex.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature biased by claustrophobia and obsession. Voice modulates under stress (e.g., "breath in shallow gasps"), and elision (e.g., phase transitions) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and vivid with high information density (e.g., "skeletal map of dried seaweed"). Rhythm varies naturally, and no loops or scaffold artifacts obscure closure. Figurative language like "star trapped in amber" is purposeful and coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of personal loss and sci-fi concepts feels inevitable; tropes are transformed through specific detail (illuminant gold as catalyst). Risk-taking in blending emotional quest with technical logic heightens stakes without gimmickry. Closure reconfigures premise.</comment>
