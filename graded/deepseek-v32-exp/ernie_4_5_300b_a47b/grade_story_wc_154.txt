<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority like "lotus-hearted ache" and micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing doodles and bringing the coral to the talks. Her motivation intensifies credibly from bridging gaps to alchemical translation, earned through prior causality with visible cost in the closure. Minor hairline slip in the widow's backstory feeling slightly summarized, but contradictory impulses act in scene and the final renunciation is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the coral as "blueprint for something whole" and the general's reaction. Accumulative/textural lens holds strong with pattern-driven escalation via images (coral, cast, mist). Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the persistent constraint of the coral shapes the final image. No causality breaks, but the peace talk shift is rapid, though functional under the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with the mist-clad atrium and moss-stained bench, sensory details like condensation and coral grooves filtered through Lira's POV. The brain coral fragment acts as micro-setting, constraining choices (e.g., her palm bite) and charging the final image. Atmosphere coheres with tone, and spatial choreography is clean, elevating stakes without ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of bridging communication escalates under accumulative lens through Lira's agency in decrypting notes and bringing coral to talks. Cost is visible in her emotional journey and the general's tactile response. One meaningful tightening occurs when her translations reconfigure options, though the peace talk resolution feels slightly swift, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of meaning from ruins emerges organically through particulars like the coral and cast mirrors, avoiding moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and images, e.g., coral as talisman. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "blueprint for something whole," reweighting prior material without stated thesis. Minor hairline slip in the widow anecdote leaning toward summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic diction ("ghost’s fingers," "lotus-hearted ache"). Voice modulates with emotional pressure, and rhythmic control is evident in peak beats. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (e.g., anesthetic) is taught and paid off in the mist imagery. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is voice-motivated but occasionally dense (e.g., "anesthetic kicked in" metaphor), slightly muddying clarity in opening. Sentence-level propulsion is strong, and closure image remains sharp. Minor overwriting in early lines prevents a 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of translator role with environmental themes feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like the bombed reef coral. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth anchors universals, and the final reconfiguration is earned through prior particulars.</comment>
