<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to seek the echo and reinterpret prophecy. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like her breath catching, and micro-choices under pressure, such as sorting buttons, reveal her values. The final choice to shape the future is earned by prior causality, though contradictory impulses are not deeply explored in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with Mara gaining wisdom and committing to raw possibility, felt cost in her smile and continued work. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through atmospheric details and the button-sorting method. Orientation is clear early, and the echo's revelation provides a decisive shift without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly atmospheric with sensory details like "dust and forgotten time" and "groaning beams," filtering through Mara's POV. The warehouse and cliffs pressure choices, and the jar/buttons as micro-settings constrain actions and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, enhancing the climactic moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unlocking the echo's secrets escalates under the accumulative lens through Mara's agency in sorting buttons, leading to a revelation that narrows options. Cost is legible in the wisdom gained and her renewed commitment. Pressure coheres without coincidence, though escalation is gradual rather than sharply tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of past shaping future emerges through events and the echo's message, avoiding moralizing. Subtext in Mara's realization that prophecies are malleable, and the final image reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity. Earned through concrete particulars like the button sorting, but slightly abstract in places.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic language and rhythm. No head-hopping; voice modulates with emotional intensity, such as when the echo "surges." Elision is purposeful, taught early, and paid off at closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has varied rhythm and high information density, advancing story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting in phrases like "unearthed silence" repeated, but no major artifacts or loops. Figurative language is coherent and supports pressure, with clear propulsion in climactic beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of tropes like the hourglass turner and echo jar, transformed through specific details and Mara's grounded choices. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
