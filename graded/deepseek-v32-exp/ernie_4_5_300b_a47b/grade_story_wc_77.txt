<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her curse, with embodied emotion under pressure, but Vey lacks depth and functions primarily as a plot device, reducing relational complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost (seared hand, clasp pulse) under a causal lens; orientation is clear early, and the plot advances through motivated because/therefore linkages.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the funhouse environment constraining choices through distorted mirrors and labyrinthine rooms, charging the final image with atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency using paradoxical notes, narrowing options with legible cost; the dominant stake tightens meaningfully under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fear and truth emerges through subtext and image, with the ending offering a non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though Vey's voice occasionally converges with the narrative tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and density with purposeful figurative language; minor scaffold in repetitive phrasing ("shadow" variations) but no major artifacts obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of curses and paradoxical resolution feels inevitable; specific details and risk-taking with the dream dictionary heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
