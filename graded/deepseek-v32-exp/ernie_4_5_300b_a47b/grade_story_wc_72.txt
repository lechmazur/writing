<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure; Lumen's incisive kindness is demonstrated through telepathic guidance. The final choice to drink the ampoule is earned by cascading revelations, though Mara's emotional progression is slightly neat, lacking contradictory impulses in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost under causal lens; the Decisive Change of Mara drinking the ampoule and the garden shuddering reconfigures stakes with felt sacrifice. Orientation is clear early, and revelations are logically sequenced, with Lumen's persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with bioluminescent algae and structural weaknesses constraining Mara's choice to access the ampoule. Sensory details are filtered through POV, and the garden's evolution charges the final image of growth in decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mara's agency under causal lens; her actions in threading fissures and drinking the ampoule narrow options with cost legible in the blight's recession. One meaningful tightening forecloses paths, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of nuance versus certainty emerges organically from revelations and sacrifice; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of decay allowing growth, without moralizing. Subtext operates in Lumen's telepathic projections.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with Mara's perceptual signature clear; telepathic communication is handled without head-hopping, and prose rhythm controls pressure. Any elision in revelations is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and no loops or artifacts; figurative language is selective and enhances clarity. Information density is high, and closure image is undulled by line-level issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis feels inevitable, with living statue and underwater lab transforming tropes through specific character stakes; risk-taking in telepathic narration heightens coherence without gimmickry, and emotional specificity avoids templates.</comment>
