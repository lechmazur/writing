<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal his shift from impatience to patience. His final success is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in his exhaustion. However, interior contradiction is subtle rather than sharply dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the viaduct surges, costing Kael's fatigue, under a coherent accumulative lens. Orientation is clear early, and the patient revolution pattern is taught and paid off. The persistent constraint of the moon's path shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the basalt sanctuary and frozen lake constraining choices and charging the final image. The viaduct and ice evolve causally, and POV filtering is consistent, avoiding cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the accumulative lens, with failed attempts tightening stakes and cost legible in his aching back and the elders' approval. The dominant stake of unyoking the viaduct deepens through patient realignment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sculpting patience emerges through concrete events and images, not statement, with subtext in the elders' mantra and Kael's dialogue. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature focused on magnetic and lunar details. Prose rhythm and diction control heighten pressure, and dialogue (when present) is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with varied syntax and clear propulsion. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is integrated without muddle. Minor overwriting in peak beats doesn't harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of a magnetic viaduct and moon-path tracking is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes, and specificity avoids template plots, with transformation through lived detail.</comment>
