<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to discover the truth; her interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as her throat tightening upon reading the journal. Micro-choices under pressure, like using the stamp to open the door, reveal her values and earn the final decision to share the story. However, minor lack of contradictory impulses in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Lira's realization of the city's self-destruction reconfigures her purpose, under a causal lens that holds throughout. The stamp as a persistent constraint shapes tactics, and orientation is clear early. The on-page cost in the journal's revelation is legible and felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated, with the sunken library pressuring choices through the submerged door and vault discovery. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, such as moonlight filtering through skylights. The environment constrains Lira's actions and charges the final image of fractured moonlight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the causal lens, from investigating the groan to using the stamp, narrowing options and revealing the journal with legible cost. The dominant stake of tracing honest origins tightens meaningfully, though the climax relies slightly on discovery rather than active confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the journal's confession of denial and Lira's resolution to rebuild on honesty, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in images like the owl crest as vigilance, and the ending reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature in Lira's "tranquilly perceptive" gaze and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice remains coherent, and elision (e.g., the blackout's cause) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping, but minor convergence in emotional peaks limits a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffolds harming closure. Figurative language is purposeful, such as "blackout crept like a thief," and read-aloud rhythm is smooth. Peak beats maintain clarity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a sunken city, library indexer, and truth-seeking feels fresh and inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details like the antique stamp. Risk-taking in the quiet ending heightens stakes, and the concept commits fully without gimmickry.</comment>
