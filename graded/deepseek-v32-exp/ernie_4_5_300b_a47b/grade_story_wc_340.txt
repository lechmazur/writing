<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies, driving key choices like investigating the diary and goggles; her inquisitive nature is embodied in micro-actions, and the final stance crystallization with the widow feels earned. However, internal conflict could be more simultaneous rather than sequential, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as the widow's detachment cracks and Mara commits to seeking the flame, under a causal lens; the elevator ascent and diary discovery create coherent because/therefore linkages, and the goggles persistently constrain tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "frosted glass" and "icebound spire," and the goggles as micro-setting constrain choice by revealing patterns; the environment charges the final image of Mara stepping into "a cavern of ice and memory."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from tidying to truth-seeking, driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens; cost is legible in the widow's emotional shift and Mara's foreclosed path, with one meaningful tightening as the diary and goggles change knowledge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of joy beneath anguish emerges through particulars like the diary phrase and goggles, without moralizing; the ending reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity, though it leans slightly toward statement in Mara's dialogue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Mara's poetic noticing; dialogue carries subtext and advances plot, and rhythmic control under pressure is evident, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "gears grinding like a tired heart" is purposeful, and closure propulsion is clear with no muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of icebound setting and emotional discovery, transforming tropes through specific details; risk-taking in poetic prose heightens stakes, though the core premise has familiar echoes.</comment>
