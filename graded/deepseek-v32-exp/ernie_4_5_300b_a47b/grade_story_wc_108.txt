<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lila's characterization is strong with concrete interiority and embodied emotions; her phobias and adaptive nature drive key choices under pressure, such as decrypting notes and confronting the enforcer. The genetic revelation of her phobias as betrayals adds depth, though the DNA test backstory feels slightly convenient. Her final stance on vulnerability is earned through on-page causality, with visible cost in her trembling certainty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly from inciting incident to closure, with clear orientation early. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lila embraces vulnerability, legible in the final café scene with cost felt in her readiness. The seashell and notes create persistent constraints that shape tactics, and no causality breaks occur.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the rusted library constraining choices (e.g., aisles guiding navigation, script used as weapon). Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, and the seashell as micro-setting charges the final image. However, the library's role diminishes slightly after the confrontation, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving vulnerability as power) escalates under causal lens through Lila's agency, from decrypting notes to outwitting the enforcer. Cost is legible in her trembling certainty and foreclosed paths. One meaningful tightening occurs when she recites the notes, narrowing options and raising stakes, though the enforcer's quick confession off-page slightly softens the peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability as power emerges organically through events and images, such as the shell's whisper and Lila's actions, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the shell's promise and Lila's readiness. Subtext operates in gestures like Marisol's shaking hands, but minor thematic echo in dialogue ("I proved vulnerability is power") slightly reduces freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending poetic rhythm and crisis-narrowed perception. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present, as in the café reunion. Voice remains coherent under pressure, though slight register drift occurs in phrases like "vulnerability wasn’t a cage. It was a compass," which feels more narrative than character-consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with purposeful figurative language and no major artifacts. Sentences advance story efficiently, such as the decryption beat. Minor synonym churn in "whispering seashell half" and "murmur" occurs but doesn't obscure clarity. Closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of phobias, stunt doubling, and mob heist, transformed through specific details like the seashell and library. Emotional truth avoids cliché, and risk-taking in thematic depth pays off. However, the DNA test revelation leans on a familiar trope, slightly limiting freshness.</comment>
