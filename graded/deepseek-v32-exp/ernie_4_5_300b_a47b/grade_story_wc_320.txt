<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, driving his actions to dismantle the tower's systems. Interiority is concrete through professional lens, and final realization is earned by prior causality. However, emotional depth is slightly abstract at peaks, lacking contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as the fragment becomes inert and the city reborns, under accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraint of the hush shapes tactics. No causality breaks; closure unit is a resonant reconfiguration with felt conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with the tower and gorge constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Kael's POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Kael's agency in dismantling assumptions, leading to a visible cost (seared palm, inert fragment). Under accumulative lens, density increase reweights the dominant stake of finding beginnings, with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as potential emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in the fragment's transformation. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the river of light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic, professional diction. Perceptual signature is clear through Kael's bias; elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; rhythmic control supports pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though minor purple tinge in peaks doesn't harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes celestial interpretation and post-apocalyptic decay with freshness, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
