<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by duty and embodied emotion (e.g., "her throat tightened"). Her micro-choices under pressure, such as finding and using the rake handle, reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final action is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the ridge's relief. However, interior contradiction is minimal, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (pendulum restarting) and felt cost (ridge's pain and relief), under a causal drive lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the ridge's state shapes tactics. The cost is legible in the "ridge’s pain" and the "gentle pulses" of the tide.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tidal obsidian ridge is indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image with its "slick with salt and time" description. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Lirael's POV, and the setting pressures the conflict directly, evolving with the resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring balance) is signaled early and escalates through Lirael's agency, driven by causal linkages (investigation, discovery, action). Cost is unmistakable in the Hush and ridge's shuddering, foreclosing options with a visible price in the "searing reverie" and relief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of incremental absolution emerges organically through the inscription and Lirael's actions, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the rake's message and grandfather's wisdom, deepening the narrative without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic prose that modulates with pressure (e.g., "the air thickening like syrup"). No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, and voice remains coherent under stress, enhancing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Sentences advance story and atmosphere efficiently (e.g., "obsidian shards shifting like scales"), and figurative language is consistent and legible, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core premise synthesizes familiar elements (time, tide, balance) with fresh specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the setting and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
