<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is concrete and embodied, with her blindness integrated into actionable traits that drive micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation to decode feedback is clear and intensifies, compelling the repair action. However, the absence of internal contradiction or genuine flaws limits depth, though her competence is balanced with struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear causal chain under an accumulative lens, with the drone repair escalating to a resonant reconfiguration at closure. Orientation is anchored early, and the ending lands with cost in Lira's enduring work. The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and the closure unit (Earned Stasis) is legible with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail, and the basin of water functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. The mist-coated depot and repair shop are woven into action, reflecting Lira's priorities and enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early and escalate through Lira's agency under the accumulative lens, with the drone malfunction forcing a tightening choice. The cost is legible in the successful repair and renewed purpose, though the pressure lacks multiple reversals, fitting the scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like light refraction and blindness, offering a resonant, non-literal answer about seeing beyond sight. Subtext operates through image and implication, avoiding moralizing, and the final reconfiguration reweights prior material without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with Lira's perceptual signature filtering sensory detail through her blindness. Voice remains coherent under pressure, and minimal dialogue feels natural. No head-hopping or register drift, but rhythmic control is strong without exceptional elevation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise and vivid, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting in descriptive passages doesn't harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of blind artisan, hummingbird drones, and light refraction feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
