<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's boredom and immortality are concretely embodied, with micro-choices under pressure, such as his hesitation before the escape, earning the final decision through prior causality. Interiority avoids stock phrasing, and the resolution forecloses a path with visible cost (the hollow self in the mirror).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (void as possibilities vs. prior silence), under a causal lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the amulets' constraint shapes tactics, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite constrains choices through warping geometry and charges the final image with its collapse. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, such as "tasted of ozone and old iron," filtered through Kael's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the causal lens, from intrigue to the decisive choice to unite fragments, with cost legible in the mirrored hollow self. Stakes tighten meaningfully, foreclosing the option of stasis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of loneliness and change emerges through events and images, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer (void as symphony of possibilities). Subtext operates in gestures like the cracked mirror.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, such as "dimensionally aware senses tingled." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, and rhythmic control under pressure supports the voice without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language, like "shimmered like a fractured rainbow," is purposeful and does not muddle peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes immortality and spatial mutiny with specificity, transforming tropes through grounded choices. Risk-taking in the void escape heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
