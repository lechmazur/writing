<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in her traits as a sculptor, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. The transition to weaver of timelines is earned through causal events, though the "perpetually learning" attribute leans slightly tell-heavy. Interiority is concrete, and the final stance change carries cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Lira reconfigures her role, felt in the final image of the tapestry. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through layered revelations. Causality is tight, with the slide and archway enabling turns, and orientation is anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the archway and storm pressuring choices and charging the closure. Details like "damp moss" and "pulsed symbols" are filtered through Lira's POV, and the archway acts as a micro-setting that constrains tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early and escalate through Lira's agency under the Accumulative lens, from finding the slide to stepping through the archway. Cost is legible in her foreclosed path as a mere sculptor, and pressure coheres to the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as sculptures becoming maps, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to complexity vs. simplicity, though the motivation statement "to scaffold complexity with simplicity" is slightly explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic diction like "turbine-hum reverie" reflecting Lira's artist perspective. Dialogue is minimal but natural, and perceptual signature is consistent, though the "perpetually learning" phrase causes minor register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and dense, with sentences advancing multiple roles, e.g., "the stone hummed, a turbine-hum reverie." No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, supporting momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of driftwood art, timewoven alliances, and magic lantern feels fresh and inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes, and the closure reweights prior material ingeniously.</comment>
