<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to uncover his erased past is clear and intensifies through accumulating fragments. His unique perception trait is embodied and influences choices, such as collecting stories. The realization of his identity as Marcus Hale is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the locket discovery. However, some emotional states could be more contradictory under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Kael realizes his true identity and resolves to act, with cost felt in the locket scene. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, driven by fragment collection. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The shipping container labyrinth constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like rust and salt tang integrated into action. The environment pressures tactics, such as climbing to avoid the tide, and the micro-setting of the locket reweights the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Kael's agency in collecting fragments, leading to the identity revelation. The dominant stake of discovering his past tightens through clues, with cost legible in the realization scene. No coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of erased histories emerges through concrete events like the poison label and letters, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with Kael's resolve, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in fragments and implications.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, such as filtering reality through colors and stories. Voice is poetic yet controlled under pressure, with purposeful elision in fragment collection. No head-hopping; dialogue, when present, is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, advancing story without scaffolding. Figurative language like "steel mountains" serves atmosphere without muddle. No major artifacts or loops; sentences propel momentum, especially in the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of erased history synthesized with fragment collection feels fresh and inevitable.
