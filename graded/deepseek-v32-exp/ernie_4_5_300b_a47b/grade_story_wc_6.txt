<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is deeply integrated with her backstory and present actions, showing contradictory impulses (guilt vs. compassion) in scene. Her micro-choice to help Mara and the bird, culminating in the release, is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("something loosen in her chest"). Embodied emotion and consistent traits under pressure elevate the score, though minor reliance on thematic echo in dialogue slightly tempers it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost ("Scars don’t forget... they just learn to sing"), reweighting the premise under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The persistent constraint of Lira's heritage shapes tactics, and cost is legible in the final image of the falling sand grain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and black sand are not merely descriptive but constrain choices (e.g., sand hissing, used in reflection) and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, with volcanic soil mirroring internal states. The environment actively pressures the narrative arc, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the Accumulative lens, as her compassion is tested through the bird rescue, narrowing options and deepening stakes. Cost is unmistakable in her emotional release and the bird's flight. The dominant stake (proving scars can sing) tightens meaningfully, though the turn is subtle, fitting the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete actions and images (coin, sand, bird), with subtext in gesture and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material. Avoids abstraction and earns wisdom through specific experience, though the phrase "scars can sing" borders on thematic echo but is integrated into dialogue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—Lira's poetic, firefighter-honed observation filters the world. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision (e.g., backstory) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats. Sentences advance story and character simultaneously, with clear propulsion. Minor poetic density in descriptions doesn't obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of arsonist's daughter turned firefighter with themes of scars and compassion feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. Risk-taking in lyrical, accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure reconfigures meaning with originality.</comment>
