<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to preserve wisdom is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions like her "strangely honest" smile and scarred serenity. Her final endurance as the line walker is earned by prior causality, though interior contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in Mara's continued duty and the stabilized clearings. The accumulative/textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early with the windless morning and pavilion setting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting elements like the kinetic parapet and murmuring pavilion constrain choices and charge the final image of glowing clearings. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, filtered through Mara's peripheral awareness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative lens, with the consecration tightening stakes and cost legible in the effort to anchor wisdom. The dominant stake of preservation is signaled early and deepens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of duty and balance emerges through particulars like the consecration and Mara's endurance, offering a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in symbols like the mask and clearings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and third-person limited to Mara, with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control. Peripheral awareness is taught early and paid off, and elision supports clarity under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, advancing story without obscuring closure in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mystical elements feels inevitable, with specific details like the whisperfield and kinetic parapet transforming tropes. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
