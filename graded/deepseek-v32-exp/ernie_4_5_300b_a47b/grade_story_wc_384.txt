<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion (trembling at the thorn) and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation (leaving the scroll) is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her penance and the thorn's curse. Contradictory impulses act in scene, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the echo of her purpose and the thorn's fading curse. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through descriptive layers to reweight stakes. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of the thorn shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details (stalactites dripping, aurora hues) filtered through Lirael's POV. The sanctuary and heritage rose thorn constrain choices (thorn used for blood seal) and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (peace vs. vengeance) escalates under the Accumulative lens through Lirael's agency in creating and placing the scroll, with cost legible in her penance and the thorn's curse. One meaningful tightening (completing the forgery) forecloses options and reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions (treason as forgiveness, the key as plea), with subtext in symbols. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the final echo of purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Lyrical prose is consistent and voice-motivated, with purposeful elision (e.g., "key with no apparent lock") taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Minor overwriting in figurative language ("liquid time") slightly dulls peak beats, but clarity remains intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of "calibrated treason" as forgiveness is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Specific details (heritage rose thorn) and risk-taking in lyric mode heighten stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
