<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, driving key choices like devising the mirror plan. Interiority is embodied in her "burnished sorrow," and the final renewal is earned with visible cost. However, internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative lens, as the dispute dissolves into renewal, cost legible in Lira's sorrow and the solidified frescoes. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the shard as a persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid, purposeful sensory details like "violet nebula" and mirrors that shape tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment actively pressures the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the accumulative lens, as her plan with the mirrors intensifies the cultural stake and leads to a collaborative climax with unmistakable cost in the "burnished sorrow." Dominant stake is signaled early and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the shard's refracted light representing renewal, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "compass pointing toward futures," reweighting loss and creation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, reflected in rhythmic control and perceptual specificity like "etching forgotten hymns." No head-hopping or elision issues; voice modulates effectively with emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, advancing story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting in figurative language exists but does not obscure clarity or closure; rhythm and syntax support the accumulative drive without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements—baroque asteroid, defunct revolutionary, crystal shard—feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the lyrical style that heightens stakes. Specific details transform tropes, and the closure image resonates with originality.</comment>
