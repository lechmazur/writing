<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The poet's "warmly attentive" trait is consistent and drives micro-choices like placing the feather, but interiority leans abstract with phrases like "fragment of woven dawns," reducing embodied emotion. His motivation to "discover beauty in the incomplete" is clear and compels action, but the final realization feels slightly told rather than fully earned through contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong with pattern-building through imagery; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the poet honors "spaces between" with cost legible in the feather's settling. Orientation is clear early, but the kite string snap motif, while functional, introduces minor coincidence that doesn't fully integrate with causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory details like "cobalt lagoon after rain" and "amber light brushing the reeds" are filtered through the poet's POV. The lagoon and feather recur to charge the final image, constraining choice when the poet places the feather to coax stillness, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, escalation occurs through density increases (e.g., ripples from gust leading to woven tapestry) and the poet's agency in writing verses. Cost is felt in the effort to harmonize, but the stakes remain somewhat abstract, with no concrete trade-off foreclosing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in incompleteness emerges organically through images like the feather and "woven dawns," avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in the realization that tending is "honoring the spaces between," with purposeful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature (e.g., "salt air settle like a gentle sigh"). Rhythm and diction control are strong, though some phrases like "woven dawns" risk over-patterning; no head-hopping or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyrical prose has high information density and varied rhythm, but figurative language stacks in peaks (e.g., "tapestry that resembled woven dawns") causing minor overwriting. No loops or artifacts harm closure; propulsion remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poet as ecological harmonizer feels inevitable, with specific details like the drake's feather transforming familiar tropes. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though the concept leans slightly abstract.</comment>
