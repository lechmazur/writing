<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. The final understanding of her purpose feels earned, though some abstraction in "entangled memories" slightly diminishes concrete interiority. Contradictory impulses are shown in her rebellion versus the lab's sterility, and the change is causally linked to her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the lab's protocol shift, a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens, costing the abandonment of cold observation. Orientation is clear early with the mossy platform and lab dome. The lens holds throughout, and the garden's response to drumming creates coherent causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vividly specific, with sensory details like vibrating blossoms and humming grass that constrain Lira's choices and charge the final image. The auric lagoon evolves meaningfully, mirroring internal states and shaping the climax. Economy and purpose in description maintain momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Lira's drumming, which intensifies under the accumulative lens, turning blossoms into luminous bells and influencing the lab. Protagonist agency drives the deepening, with cost legible in the shift to collaboration. One meaningful tightening occurs, though the escalation relies slightly on symbolic resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sorrow transforming into hope emerges through concrete images like the auroral lagoon and drumming, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the garden's song and shared dream. Subtext operates in gestures and implications, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and limited to Lira, with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature. Rhythm and syntax modulate with emotional intensity, supporting pressure. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure. Dialogue is absent, so not applicable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting risks appear in stacked metaphors (e.g., "auric lagoon like an auric lagoon"). No significant loops or artifacts; clarity and propulsion are maintained, especially in peak beats. Information density is high, advancing story and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of a guinea pig protagonist in a sound wave garden feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is integrated organically, with emotional specificity avoiding generic templates.</comment>
