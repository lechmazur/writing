<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to teach silence is clear and consistent, driving her micro-choices like whispering counter-tones. However, interiority leans abstract with unearned epiphanies (e.g., "she felt the universe pause to listen"), lacking embodied contradiction or struggle under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with pattern-based escalation; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as silence comforts passengers, cost legible in the storm glass vial emptying and Lira's fulfillment. Orientation is clear early, and transitions are smooth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated, with the prism terrace and storm glass vial constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, mirroring internal states without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, stakes escalate through the vial's color changes and Lira's agency in monitoring noise, leading to a meaningful tightening where silence swells with cost. Dominant stake of creating calm is coherent and deepened.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of silence as comfort emerges through particulars like the vial's transformation and whispered tones, offering a resonant, non-literal answer at closure. Subtext operates in gestures and images without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with lyrical perceptual signature (e.g., "fractured lullabies"). Rhythmic control under pressure, and elision (e.g., train whistle echo) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and propulsion, but minor figurative muddle (e.g., "fractured lullabies") and redundancy in silence descriptions slightly dull closure. No major loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (gondola operator, storm glass) feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in lyricism heightening stakes. Specific details like the prism terrace avoid template plots.</comment>
