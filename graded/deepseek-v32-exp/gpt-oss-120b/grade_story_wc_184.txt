<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her actions; interiority is concrete through cataloguing and reweaving. The final choice to step through the door is earned by prior causality, with cost in the frozen clock. However, her emotional progression lacks contradictory impulses under pressure, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is on-page with a decisive change (door dissolves, clock stops) and felt cost under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The wax seal and rope constraints shape tactics, ensuring coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the clock tower mechanism room and vault constraining choices (e.g., door visibility at midnight). Sensory details are filtered through Mara's POV, and the rope charges the final image, integrating environment with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens, from discovering the door to reweaving the rope. Cost is legible in the clock's stillness and her gained clarity. One meaningful tightening forecloses options, though the stakes remain slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of absence as bridges emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mara's realization, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext in the fables enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and controlled, modulating with pressure. No head-hopping or elision issues. However, dialogue is absent, limiting evaluation of subtext and character distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though minor purple tones in peaks don't harm clarity. Read-aloud test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of archivist, paradoxical door, and fables of absence, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical complexity heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the concept is fully integrated.</comment>
