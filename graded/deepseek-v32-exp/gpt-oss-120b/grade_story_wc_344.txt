<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion in trembling fingers and heavy breath, but lacks deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses; final choice to fix the clock is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in nostalgia and hope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the clock repairing and library brightening, under a causal-hybrid lens; cost is legible in "heart heavy with driftwood nostalgia"; orientation is clear early, and prophecy-to-action causality holds without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory-rich setting (frozen library, singing crystals) constrains choices by guiding the search and culminating in the hall of mirrors; environment charges the final image with the gear's hum and melting frost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under causal lens, from search to prophecy to gear activation; cost is felt in nostalgia and hope, narrowing options meaningfully, though stakes remain slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of repair emerges organically through images like gears and mirrors, with subtext in memory and hope; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in "every repair sang its own story" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct poetic voice with stable POV; perceptual signature in phrases like "frayed like old driftwood" and rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical prose with high information density and clear propulsion; minor overwriting in repeated "hauntingly bright" but no major loops or artifacts; closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of celestial locksmith and repair theme feels inevitable; specific details like shadow-carved keys transform tropes; risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
