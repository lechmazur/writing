<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. Her micro-choices, like tracing the film negative, reveal values under pressure, and the final acceptance of the legacy's burden is earned with visible cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; characterization is consistent and deep.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with closure as a conceptual repricing where Lira understands the walls' dreams, reconfiguring meaning with felt cost. Orientation is early and clear; structure builds through resonant imagery. The ending lands with undeniable pressure, and the legacy transformation is decisive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the ivy-veiled passage and film negative constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, enhancing atmosphere. The environment actively shapes Lira's actions and the closure, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering walls' dreams) escalates through Lira's agency with the film negative, leading to a meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the shared communion transformation. Pressure coheres and tightens without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of legacy and shared memory emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the wall's lullaby image, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical yet controlled, reflecting Lira's sensitivity. Prose rhythm varies purposefully, and elision (e.g., with the film negative) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and enhances clarity, even in peak beats. Sentence-level craft supports rhythm and momentum, avoiding overwriting or artifactual deductions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Concept is highly original—echo cartography and walls dreaming—synthesized with specific details that feel inevitable. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
