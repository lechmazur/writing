<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative from refusal to map-piecing with embodied emotion. However, interior contradiction is minimal, as she remains steadfast without significant internal conflict, preventing a higher score despite strong micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the sky healing and plate glowing, under a hybrid causal-accumulative lens that holds throughout. Cost is legible in the plate's graying and subsequent renewal, and the map's piecing creates a coherent cause-effect chain leading to the vent's activation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "taste of rust" and bioluminescent ferns, constraining choices through the toxic sky and plate's reactions. The greenhouse city and cavern function as micro-settings that charge the final image of healing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal refusal to global healing, driven by protagonist agency under the hybrid lens. Cost is unmistakable in the plate's fading and the vent's surge, with one meaningful tightening as lost conversations are restored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of candor healing society emerges organically through events like the plate's pulses and bottled speeches, with a resonant non-literal answer in the sky's healing. Minor explicit echo in "candor can bloom" slightly reduces score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, e.g., "glass towers breathing misty sighs," and perceptual signature remains consistent under pressure. Elision in map-piecing is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with no loops or scaffold, sustaining rhythm through varied syntax. Figurative language like "ink shimmered like sunrise" is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of calligrapher, zinc plate, and lost conversations feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the accumulative design heightening stakes. Transformation of tropes through specific world logic supports freshness.</comment>
