<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and drives the plot, but interiority lacks deep contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure. The final choice to return the arrow tip is earned but lacks intense internal conflict, with cost feeling more conceptual than personally felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Mira releases the arrow tip, promising renewal with visible cost under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with motivated ellipsis, though the cost could be more deeply personal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as navigation by water flow and gravity inversion. The floating rock arches and inverted environment charge the final image, integrating sensory detail with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens, from discovery to return of the arrow tip, with cost legible in her renunciation. Stakes are clear and tighten meaningfully, though the conflict lacks intense friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of resilience and renewal emerges organically through events and images, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext in echoes and the arrow tip's dissolution avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, and voice remains coherent under pressure. No head-hopping; prose is textured, though dialogue is absent and elision is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no major loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is controlled, but minor density in peak beats slightly obscures clarity without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes original elements like inverted gravity and echoes with specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in world-building heightens stakes without gimmickry, and transformation is grounded.</comment>
