<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Motivation is profound and clear, rooted in the writer's desire to encode human essence; micro-choices under pressure, such as aligning lenses and guiding ink, reveal hierarchy of values; final orchestration of revolution is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the writer's actions lead to ongoing impact; causal lens holds tightly from microdot specs to visitor's revelation; orientation is anchored early; cost is legible in the final image of secrets rippling through the world.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is integral, with the lighthouse constraining choices (lantern alignment, beam sweeping) and charging the final image; sensory details (howling wind, scented oil) are selective and purposeful; micro-setting functions as a tool that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (encoding life into coded fragments) escalates through writer's agency in adopting microdot technique; tightening occurs as prophecies become deliberate carriers of truth; cost is felt in the transformation and spreading secrets, though less visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of open secrets and transformation emerges organically from events and images; subtext in irony of accidental prophecies; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through gull carrying message and strangers rewired.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with lyrical, poetic voice; perceptual signature is clear in selective noticing; minor ornate density in peaks, but no head-hopping or coherence loss.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety; figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off; no loops or scaffolds; minor overwriting in dense imagery, but clarity maintained in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of fortune cookie writer, spycraft, and lighthouse; tropes transformed through specific grounded choices; emotional truth in encoding human essence; risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
