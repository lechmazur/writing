<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion like "fierce tenderness." Micro-choices, such as evoking the letters, reveal hierarchy of values, and the final renunciation is earned with visible cost as the weight dissolves. However, some emotional states edge toward diagnostic language, e.g., "paradox of strength and gentle surrender," slightly reducing immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the apology is woven into the soil, reweighting options with felt cost. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of spiritual guidance and shard use coheres. Minor ambiguity in the lagoon scene's causality does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices—mangrove roots "part like soft hands," and the shard as micro-setting constrains tactics. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, e.g., "damp air into a living hymn," charging the final image where the lagoon reflects moonlight. No generic placeholder elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict over unsent letters) escalates under accumulative lens through protagonist's agency—evoking letters, using shard—deepening with cost as weight dissolves. Pressure coheres via spiritual urging and environmental shifts, but one beat (veil lifting) relies slightly on convenience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken apology emerges organically through images and actions, not statement; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer with the apology woven into soil. Subtext operates in gestures like the shard's pulse, avoiding moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—poetic, rhythmic prose reflects the medium's mindset. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., unsent letters' content) is taught and pays off. Voice modulates with pressure, e.g., "fierce tenderness" softening at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "roots intertwined like whispered verses." Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements synthesize uniquely—cryptic medium, shard, condensation messages—feeling inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices; risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids templates.</comment>
