<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and drives the narrative, with her watchfulness and donor heart enabling key choices. However, internal contradiction is minimal, and the final commitment, while earned, lacks a deeply embodied cost on the page, slightly reducing impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lira's promise reconfigures her role, with cost felt in her pledge. The accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, and orientation is clear early, though the donor heart's integration feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the floating rock tea house and blue morpho wing charging the final image at the loom. The environment constrains choice through the wing's reflective map and the tea house's latent energy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Lira's agency in tracking sun trails and reading the scroll, leading to a decisive choice under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in her promise to guard stories, though the escalation is more thematic than pressure-driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of iridescent caution emerges organically from imagery and revelation, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through Lira's pact. Subtext operates in the wing's warning and the donor heart's rhythm, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature that filters setting through Lira's bias. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision (e.g., sun trails) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm, but minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "quietly explosive" repetition) slightly reduces momentum. No major artifacts or loops, and closure clarity remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements (dye master, donor heart, morpho wing) feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the accumulative structure. Specificity in details like the luminous heart and sun trails avoids template reliance.</comment>
