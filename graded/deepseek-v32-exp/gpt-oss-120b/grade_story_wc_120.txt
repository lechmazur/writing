<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lian's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., sand between toes); final transformation from homesick to conductor is earned through on-page actions with visible cost, though slight lack of interior contradiction limits peak score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration as Lian becomes conductor; accumulative/textural lens holds strongly; cost is legible in her emotional shift and the world's response; orientation is clear within first 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with glass spire and frozen lake constraining choices (spire resonates, lake becomes membrane) and charging the final image; sensory details are purposeful and integrated with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early; escalation is driven by Lian's agency under accumulative lens (whispering fortunes, sketching scores); cost is unmistakable in her transformation and the world's reaction; one meaningful tightening occurs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images; subtext operates in implication (e.g., nautilus as compass); ending offers a non-literal answer through the symphony and fortune without moralizing, though the final fortune slightly edges toward statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct; voice is poetic with rhythmic control under pressure; perceptual signature is consistent; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "batons of luminous sound"); rhythm varies naturally, though minor overwriting in peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and non-obvious; synthesis of homesickness, memory, and art feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; specific details anchor universals.</comment>
