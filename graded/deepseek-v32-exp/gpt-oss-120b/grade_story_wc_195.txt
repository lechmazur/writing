<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Knight's interiority is concrete and embodied, with earned change from solitary to connected through on-page choices; motivation intensifies under pressure, though contradictory impulses are not deeply explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost as knight's allegiance reshapes reality; orientation is clear early, and patterns pay off at ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting vividly pressures choices (e.g., control panel, vapor arches) and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, integrating with character perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes in capturing possibility escalate through knight's agency under accumulative lens; cost is legible in his transformation, tightening options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of allegiance and possibility emerges through images and events, offering a resonant, non-literal answer at closure without moralizing; subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is poetic and consistent, elision taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds; figurative language is pattern-taught and supports propulsion, though minor ornate moments exist.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of knight, alchemy, and marionette themes feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
