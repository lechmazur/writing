<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to prove whispers travel farther than shouts is clear and drives her actions, with embodied emotion like "tears glistening like dew" and "screaming tenderness." However, interior contradiction is underdeveloped, and the final choice, while earned, lacks visible cost beyond emotional release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Mara's emotional surge and the sea's response. The lens holds consistently, and orientation is anchored early with the cobalt lighthouse and dawn setting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory details like "scent of jasmine and rosemary" and "cobalt stones" are vivid and purposeful. The vial cork and lighthouse balcony function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image, with the cork's crack catching light to reinforce theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens occurs through density increase in sensory and emotional layers, driven by Mara's agency in using the cork and scent. Cost is legible in her "screaming tenderness" and the fisherman's guided arrival, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of soft power emerges organically through images like the "whispered promise" and the cork's light, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the lighthouse "beating in rhythm with the world." No moralizing or abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic syntax and rhythm. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., the cork's unseen light) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm, though minor overwriting occurs in phrases like "screaming tenderness." No significant loops or scaffold artifacts; clarity and momentum are maintained, especially in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The blend of magical realism with specific, grounded details (e.g., vial cork purifying intentions) feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the synthesis transforms familiar tropes through character-driven choices.</comment>
