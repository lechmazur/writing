<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The traveler's motive to map healing through obituaries is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority (e.g., kneeling on leaves, feeling texture) and a credible shift from lonesome splendor to hope. However, the character lacks deep internal conflict or flaws that compound under pressure, limiting complexity. The final choice to continue is earned by prior causality, but without visible cost from contradictions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as the traveler's hope softens and the garden invites continuation, with cost legible in the emotional shift. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, building through vignettes to a decisive reweighting. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details (damp amber, rustling leaves) filtered through the traveler's POV. The garden charges the final image by leaning closer, constraining the narrative through its atmosphere and recurring motifs. Economy and selectivity reinforce the accumulative drive, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes center on understanding healing, escalating through the traveler's agency in projecting presence and writing, leading to the rose's revival and emotional shift. Under the accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, but the cost, while felt, is not sharply tied to a trade-off or foreclosed option. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of healing through absences emerges organically from concrete actions and images (e.g., the revived rose, weft thread map), without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the geography of healing, reweighting prior material with purposeful ambiguity. Subtext operates in implication and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, controlled rhythm, and perceptual signature (e.g., noticing "withered blossom as an absence"). Elision and compression are taught early and pay off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift; diction remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, varying syntax, and clear propulsion. Minor overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "love left hanging like ripe grapes") doesn't obscure clarity, and no loops or artifacts harm closure. Rhythm supports the accumulative drive, though some sentences border on purple prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise of obituaries for the living and geography of healing is fresh and non-obvious, synthesized with specific details (weft thread, garden). Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable. Transformation of tropes through grounded choices avoids derivative patterns.</comment>
