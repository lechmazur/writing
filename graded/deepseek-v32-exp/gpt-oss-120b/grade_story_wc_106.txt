<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation shifts credibly from thief to preserver, earned through on-page actions like reinterpreting flower codes and lighting the lantern. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions such as feeling "the pull of destiny." The final choice to guard moments forecloses her thief path with visible cost in her whispered promise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Lira redefines her purpose, costing her thief identity. Causal lens holds tightly: each beat (unlocking jar, following map, igniting lantern) stems from prior actions. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible in the final image of the lantern as a beacon.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices: the station's hidden tunnels guide Lira's path, and the library's crystal scrolls charge the final image. Sensory details like "lanterns hung like suspended fireflies" are vivid and purposeful, filtered through Lira's POV to mirror her reverence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the causal lens, from unlocking the jar to discovering the library. Stakes shift from theft to preservation, with cost felt in her renunciation of stealing. One meaningful tightening occurs when the moonbeams reveal the map, narrowing her options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preserving fleeting moments emerges organically through Lira's arc, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the lantern's glow, reweighting prior thefts as cherished preservation. Subtext operates in gestures like her whispered promise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Lira, with a distinct poetic voice ("moved like liquid dusk"). Dialogue with the conductor is minimal but natural, carrying subtext in the rose offering. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical but risks overwriting in peaks (e.g., "painting the sky in whispers"). However, information density is high, advancing story without loops. Rhythm varies naturally, and closure image remains clear despite figurative intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of thief tropes with mystical elements like flower codes and moonbeams feels inevitable. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity in details (e.g., velvet case, jade door) anchors the premise uniquely.</comment>
