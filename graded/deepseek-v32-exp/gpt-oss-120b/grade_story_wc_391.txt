<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to sculpt patience from impatience is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions like "felt the unyoke of her own restless yearning" and micro-choices under pressure, such as aligning the compass. The final earned stasis is rooted in prior causality, with visible cost in her internal shift. Contradictory impulses of wildness and calm are integrated in scene, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost when "the frozen lake seemed to breathe," unyoking her yearning under the accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the magnetic viaduct's persistent constraint shapes tactics. No causality breaks; cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the basalt sanctuary and frozen lake constraining choices like moon tracking and charging the final image of the lake breathing. Sensory details ("ice sang a thin, glassy hymn") are filtered through Elara's POV, and the environment actively pressures the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sculpting patience escalates under the accumulative lens through density increases in moon path tracking and the magnetic surge at the apex, driven by Elara's agency. Cost is unmistakable in her internal unyoking and the lake's resonance, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of patient revolution emerges organically through particulars like the viaduct's hum and moon paths, with subtext in gestures and images. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the mantra "unyoke the rush, honor the still," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature focused on patterns and magnetism; voice is lyrical and controlled, modulating with pressure like in the climax's "low, resonant hum." No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language ("restrained wildness") is consistent and clear, even in peak beats. Sentences advance story and atmosphere without muddle, supporting propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of horizon mapper, magnetic viaduct, and patient revolution feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightening stakes. Specificity in details like moon paths transforms familiar concepts, and the closure image is indelibly tied to this vision.</comment>
