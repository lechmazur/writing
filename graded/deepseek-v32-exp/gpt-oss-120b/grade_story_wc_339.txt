<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mort's quietly analytic nature is consistently embodied through his actions and reflections, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., untangling wires) revealing his hierarchy of values. His realization about letting go as transformation is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with felt cost in the melancholy release. Minor passivity fits the tone, but interiority avoids stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, with closure as a Conceptual Repricing where the snow globe's shattering reweights the theme of letting go with undeniable cost. Orientation is clear early (Mort in sunken ship library), and the persistent constraint of the transmission shapes tactics. No causality breaks; cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (e.g., breath as bubble, corroded microphone) are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mort's POV. The snow globe as micro-setting constrains choice and charges the final image, mirroring the ship's fate and embodying the theme. Atmosphere cohesively supports the melancholic tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is driven by Mort's agency in untangling wires, leading to the transmission and his realization, with cost unmistakable in the release and shattering. Dominant stake (understanding letting go) tightens through a meaningful deepening that reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of letting go as transformation emerges organically from particulars (untangling, snow globe, transmission) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the snow globe's shattering and star-drift, reweighting prior material with sophisticated ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—Mort's analytic yet poetic voice—and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (e.g., Earhart reference) is taught and pays off in closure. Dialogue is absent, so not evaluated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story and theme without loops or scaffold. Figurative language (e.g., "snow globe's tiny storm") is consistent and purposeful, with no muddle in peak beats. Read-aloud flow is smooth and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elements (sunken library, Earhart, snow globe) feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style heightening stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation of tropes through grounded choices in character and theme resists template plots.</comment>
