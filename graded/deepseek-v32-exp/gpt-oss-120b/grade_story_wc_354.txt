<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, and the final choice to rewrite the covenant is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The worry stone's use and micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with felt cost under the accumulative/textural lens; the inferred lens holds without contradiction, and the magnetic nexus constrains tactics. Orientation is clear early, and the covenant's rebirth is legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory detail filtered through POV; the magnetic nexus and worry stone constrain choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve with the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in the covenant's renewal; dominant stake is signaled early and tightens through correlation and piece placement. One meaningful deepening occurs, but stakes remain slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images and events, not direct statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the covenant's rebirth. Subtext operates in silence translation and pattern correlation, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a perceptual signature; prose has rhythmic control and purposeful compression. Voice is coherent, though some dense phrasing slightly obscures immediacy, but no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with high information density; minor overwriting (e.g., repeated "hopeful melancholy") and template cadence in peaks, but no major artifacts harm closure. Rhythm varies naturally, and sentences advance story.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of chess, exile, and cosmic elements feels inevitable; tropes are transformed through specific details like the worry stone and covenant. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
