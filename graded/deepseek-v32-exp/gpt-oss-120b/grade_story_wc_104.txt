<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot with embodied actions like "staggering grace" and patient puzzle-solving. However, the characterization lacks internal contradiction or complex impulses, rendering her somewhat single-faceted under pressure. The final choice to plant the seed is earned, but without on-page conflicting desires, it limits depth. Strengths in concrete interiority and micro-choices are evident, but the absence of contradictory impulses prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot exhibits strong causal linkages under a Causal drive lens, with Mara's actions directly leading to closure. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the closure—a Decisive Change with the wall falling and seed sprouting—lands with felt cost in the symbolic renewal. The puzzle and arrow constraints shape tactics throughout, and the ending reconfigures stakes without exposition. No causality breaks or teleporting props; structure is tight and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, from the "rusted cathedral" carnival to the phosphorescent fungi, constraining choices like the piano bench puzzle and vault descent. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, integrating into action without stalling momentum. The environment charges the final image with the crumbling wall and emerging shoot, meeting the 9+ test by altering tactics and resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preventing famine is signaled early and escalates through Mara's agency under the Causal lens, with meaningful tightening in the puzzle solve and vault access. Cost is legible in the effort and symbolic wall collapse, but the absence of on-page antagonistic pressure or internal conflict slightly limits escalation depth. Protagonist-driven choices narrow options credibly, though stakes remain more conceptual than viscerally tested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resilience and renewal emerges organically through symbols like the chains, seed, and wall, without moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer via the planted shoot and fallen wall, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost. Subtext operates in imagery and implication, but the "wall comes down" metaphor borders on overt, though it avoids sermonizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature reflecting Mara's strategic resolve. Voice modulates with pressure, e.g., in the puzzle-solving rhythm, and elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift, but minor overwriting in phrases like "forgotten throat" slightly tempers control. Diction remains character-consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without scaffolds or loops. Figurative language is generally coherent, though metaphors like "forgotten throat" strain slightly in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion is strong, and clarity is maintained throughout closure. No major artifacts, but minor ornamental phrasing prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes fresh, non-obvious elements—carnival setting, seed vault, chained liberator—with organic integration into character and conflict. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the ash-fletched arrow, and the ending feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical imagery heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the concept commits fully to its implications.</comment>
