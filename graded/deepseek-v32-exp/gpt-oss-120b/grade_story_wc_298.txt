<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maelia's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion shown through actions like feeling the chill and carving sigils. Her reckless idealism drives key choices, and the final renewal is earned by prior causality, though interior contradiction could be more pronounced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as the tarot card dissolves into amber, patching her soul under an accumulative lens. Orientation is immediate, and the persistent constraint of the bartered destinies shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, charging the final image with roots coiling around bones. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, fully integrated with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maelia's agency, such as inlaying sigils and placing the card, narrowing options under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the transformation, though stakes remain primarily internal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice and renewal emerges organically through imagery like the burned tarot and amber thread, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext is rich in implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, and perceptual signature is consistent. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure, though dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density, but minor overwriting occurs in peak beats (e.g., "inlaying meaning everywhere" repeated). No major artifacts harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of a catacomb orchard and bartered destinies feels fresh and specific, synthesized into a coherent whole. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
