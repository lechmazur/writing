<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysander's motivation to guard his defiance is clear and drives choices, with embodied emotions in micro-choices like scattering seeds. However, interiority in peak moments occasionally leans abstract, such as "felt the chaos converge," slightly reducing concrete specificity under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost—the greenhouse becomes a "living archive of rebellion"—under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and causality holds through patterned escalation, with the gourd seed's crack serving as a pivotal cost anchor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "metallic echo" and "crackled husk" woven into action. Specificity is high, and the setting actively shapes tactics, such as using vents for chant propagation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Lysander's agency, from whispering verses to Dr. Mirabel's alignment, under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the "seedling of dissent" image, though one minor dip in pressure occurs when chaos is described abstractly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of thought freedom emerges through particulars like the Loom's patterns and the gourd seed's echo, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the "living archive" image reweighting prior defiance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic rhythm and perceptual signature in phrases like "whispers rose, warping the ambient air." Dialogue is minimal but functional; no head-hopping, though minor register consistency slips in peak chaos description.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied syntax and purposeful figurative language. However, slight overwriting in phrases like "converging chaos into a single, luminous thread" causes minor clarity loss in high-pressure beats, though closure remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, transforming rebellion tropes through specific details like thought taxation and plant-based communication. Synthesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
