<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply embodied, with "furiously tranquil" reflecting contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her motivation to discover borrowed time drives key choices, and the final renunciation is earned through prior causality with visible cost in the seed planting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost legible in the vortex scattering "shards of time." Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, reinforcing the theme of cyclical growth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The icebound atrium constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "cold perfume" and "shimmering mist" woven into action. The setting pressures Mira's decisions and evolves causally, supporting the narrative drive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Accumulative lens, with the vortex deepening as she surrenders the acorn cap. Cost is unmistakable in the "fleeting glimpse of eternity" and the atrium's transformation, foreclosing prior options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images like the "texture of borrowed time," offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the mist's "translucent hand," deepening the cyclical covenant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Mira's role. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in phrases like "wild and serene," and any elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold. Figurative language, such as "time like a garden of perpetual bloom," is coherent and supports peak beats without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements like vortex inheritance and borrowed time feels inevitable and fresh, with risk-taking in the poetic style heightening stakes. Specific details, such as the oak acorn cap, transform familiar tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
