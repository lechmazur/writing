<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to translate isolation into independence is clear and drives the narrative, with embodied emotion in moments like feeling the "brittle awakenings." However, internal conflict is underdeveloped; her journey lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, making the characterization strong but not deeply flawed or complex.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, with cost legible in the library's awakening and Mira's independence. The structure coheres, and orientation is clear early, but the drive lens slightly ambiguates mid-story before solidifying at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tidal library setting is indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image with specific, sensory details like "shelves floated like kelp" and the stone circle's hum. It pressures tactics and enriches atmosphere without generic placeholder elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes of isolation vs. independence escalate through Mira's agency with the sundial, leading to a meaningful tightening where coexistence is achieved with visible cost. Under the accumulative lens, density increases, but the escalation lacks multiple distinct beats of pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of coexistence and memory emerges organically through images like the sky-whale's ghost and the sundial's light, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, but occasional abstract phrasing slightly reduces clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and rhythmic control under pressure, as in "each brittle awakening of her confidence steadied her climb." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off, though dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with varied syntax and sensory detail, but minor overwriting occurs, such as "atomically reflective" repeated without full payoff. No major loops or artifacts harm closure, though figurative language occasionally strains.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes extinct species, mystical library, and memory in a fresh, non-obvious way, with specific details that feel inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, though it leans slightly on familiar archetypes.</comment>
