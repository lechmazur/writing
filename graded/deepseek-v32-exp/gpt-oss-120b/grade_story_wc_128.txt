<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is consistent with clear motives rooted in her traits; her "cautious exuberance" and decision to return the locket show embodied emotion under pressure. The closure choice to share stories is earned by prior causality, though some interiority edges toward told emotion rather than fully dramatized contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the locket is returned and community stories are recorded, under a causal lens where events link logically. Cost is legible in the final image of the locket on the balcony, and orientation is clear within the first 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details like "scented pages" and "brine" filtering through Mara's POV; the library and lighthouse constrain choices and charge the final image, as the environment actively shapes the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens, from initiating the return to uplifting contributors; cost is visible in the closure with the locket's placement and the community's response, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of compassion cycles emerges through particulars like the locket and community ledger, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, with subtext in gestures like the wind carrying the locket's shine.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm and diction reflect Mara's mind, and any elision is purposeful. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "constellations twinkled like lanterns" is coherent and purposeful, though minor purple phrases exist without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of compassion cycles with cargo brokerage; the concept feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming familiar tropes.</comment>
