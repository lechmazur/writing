<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority like "luminous doubt" driving her choices. Her final action—awakening the seed—is earned through prior causality and micro-choices under pressure, with visible cost in the monsoon threat. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; contradictions like doubt and resolve are shown in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with cost as the seed sprouts and the monsoon gathers, under an accumulative/textural lens that holds. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of time shapes tactics. The drive lens is coherent, with dream interpretation leading to a resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—ridge, lanterns, citrus rain—and constrains choice by housing collective memory. Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered, charging the final image. The ridge as micro-setting alters tactics and supports closure, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protecting cultural memory) escalates through Mara's agency in dream interpretation, tightening under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the monsoon threat and seed's fragility. One meaningful deepening changes knowledge and options, driven by protagonist action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from symbols (seed, dreams) without direct statement; the ending offers a non-literal answer through the sprouting seed and balanced hope. Subtext operates in imagery, and resonance arises from particulars, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—"empirically whimsical" mind filters details. Voice is consistent and rhythmically controlled, even under pressure. No head-hopping; purposeful compression in dream sequences supports closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and clear. Sentences advance story and atmosphere, with no loops or scaffold. Read-aloud test passes with propulsion, especially in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of reality checking, dream interpretation, and collective memory feels inevitable and fresh. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details anchor universals, and transformation of tropes is grounded.</comment>
