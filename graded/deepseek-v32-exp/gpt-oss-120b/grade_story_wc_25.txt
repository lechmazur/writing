<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Milo's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with micro-choices under pressure, such as placing the zodiac coin and following the map's glow. His interiority is concrete, shown through embodied reactions like feeling the storm's "electric tang," and his final validation feels earned. However, the lack of deep internal contradiction or significant flaw prevents a higher score, though the characterization supports closure effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with Milo's proof of the whisper legend, reconfiguring his belief with felt cost in the discovered parchment. The causal lens holds tightly through because/therefore linkages, such as the storm activating the map leading to key discoveries. Orientation is anchored early, and the structure as a single continuous scene with one transition maintains coherence and pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting of the port city labyrinth during a geomagnetic storm is vividly sensory and purposeful, constraining choices through the map's glowing paths and the storm's influence. Details like "rusted shipping containers" and "static radios" are filtered through Milo's POV, charging the final image. The environment actively shapes tactics, meeting the 9+ test by altering navigation and discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Milo's agency under the causal lens, as his challenge tightens options through the map's adjustments and key use, with cost legible in his effort and the resonant parchment. The dominant stake of proving whispers travel farther is tested and deepened, though the escalation lacks multiple reversals, fitting the scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Milo's experiment, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the parchment's message. Subtext operates in gestures like the key's vibration and the storm's chorus, avoiding moralizing. The conceptual repricing of whispers as "true currents" reweights prior material without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with a poetic, perceptual signature reflecting Milo's focus on hidden patterns. POV remains stable in single focalization, and rhythmic control under pressure is evident in lines like "the containers loomed like silent sentinels." No head-hopping or register drift occurs, and any elision serves closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or artifacts. Figurative language, such as "creases like age-worn veins," is purposeful and clear, and propulsion remains strong through peak beats. No scaffolding or coherence issues detract from closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes geomagnetic storms and whisper legends with originality, transformed through specific details like the zodiac coin and key. Risk-taking in the mystical-realist tone heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable from established patterns. Emotional truth arises from Milo's stubborn curiosity, avoiding derivative templates.</comment>
