<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to defy hopelessness is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied actions like chanting and handling the rag knot. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final renunciation of despair is earned by prior causality. However, some emotional states lean slightly abstract in peak beats, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration where fireworks complete the mosaic note, lifting hopelessness with felt cost. Orientation is anchored early, and the structure coheres through patterned escalation. Minor ambiguity in the "gravity of hopelessness" metaphor slightly limits the score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the fortress and night atmosphere constraining choices (e.g., rag knot filtering damp air). The environment charges the final image as vines cradle fireworks, and details are filtered through the designer's POV with purposeful economy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of defying hopelessness escalates under the accumulative lens through the designer's agency, culminating in the firework burst that reweights options with visible cost. Pressure coheres and tightens, though the escalation relies more on texture than causal turns, capping the score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of art transforming despair emerges organically through images like the mosaic and fireworks, with subtext in the rag knot's evolution. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the final burst.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and rhythmic control; perceptual signature is strong in noticing fortress pulses and mosaic notes. No head-hopping or elision issues, though minor register consistency in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language serving purpose and closure. No major loops or artifacts, but slight overwriting in dense metaphor stacks (e.g., "velvet blank that swallowed hope") slightly reduces momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fireworks designer and mosaic concept feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style that heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details like the kerosene rag knot transform familiar tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
