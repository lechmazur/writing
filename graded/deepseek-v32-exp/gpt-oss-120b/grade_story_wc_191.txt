<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mina's motivation is clear and drives the plot, with embodied actions like the ruby flake pulsing in her palm. However, internal conflict is underdeveloped, lacking contradictory impulses in scene. The final choice to claim the throne is earned through causality, but emotional depth is limited to determination.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly with clear because/therefore linkages from search to ascent. Closure is a decisive change with cost legible in the throne's acceptance and world transformation. Orientation is anchored early, and the stairway discovery pays off setup without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "fermented jasmine and silicon" and holographic vines, constraining choices via the murals and fissure. The orchard and waterfall charge the final image of intertwined roots and data streams, making it indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding the stairway before sunrise) escalates under causal lens through Mina's agency, narrowing options with each clue. Cost is felt in the weight of histories and unity achieved, though pressure could be sharper in middle beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of balance between memory and future emerges through images like the pixelated rain and data trees, not statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the throne as a bridge, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, reflected in phrases like "nostalgic reminder of forgotten futures." No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent, though dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush with strong rhythm and variation, but minor overwriting occurs, e.g., "holographic dew glimmered" and stacked metaphors. No major loops or artifacts; clarity remains in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of futuristic nostalgia with specific details like neon ruins and crystal ink feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in blending analog and digital elements heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
