<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and deeply personal, rooted in childhood memory, with embodied emotion in micro-choices like tracing patterns. However, interiority occasionally edges into abstract phrasing ("conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion"), slightly reducing concrete specificity under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the pulse echoing her heartbeat and the library's exhale. Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, but minor ambiguity in the "edge of oblivion receding" slightly softens the cost's immediacy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice—the frozen library's shifting frequencies directly shape the measurement action. The environment charges the final image with the "constellation of luminous vows," meeting the 9+ test for tactical impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in the "weight of each vow" and the pulse. However, the stakes remain slightly abstract, lacking a visceral trade-off beyond thematic weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions, with the final vow ("memory, measured gently, could outlast oblivion") offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing, though the concept of "oblivion" is somewhat broad.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature ("quartz hush of her thoughts"). Rhythmic control is strong, but minor register drift in phrases like "conjure meaning" slightly jars with the chief's meticulous tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied rhythm, but figurative language occasionally stacks ("sunrise of promises," "needles of revelation"), causing mild overwriting in peak beats without harming closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of frozen archive and luminous vows feels inevitable, with risk-taking in accumulative structure. The concept transforms familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices in setting and character motive.</comment>
