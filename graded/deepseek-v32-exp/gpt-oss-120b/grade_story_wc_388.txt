<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her actions from start to closure. Her observant nature and intuition are demonstrated through micro-choices like sorting letters and following the map, earning the final renunciation. However, internal contradiction or embodied emotion under stress is limited, leaning toward rational decision-making without deep flaws. The cost of responsibility is visible but could be more visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Mira realizes the stillpoint is mental, triggering an environmental shift with felt cost in her responsibility. The causal lens holds tightly, with each beat—reassembling letters, finding the diamond—driven by her agency. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph, and the persistent constraint of the diamond's inscription shapes the final image. No causality breaks or outline-like sequencing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard is vividly rendered with selective sensory details (e.g., "phosphorescent sheen" of fruit) that pressure choices and charge the final image of stillness. Setting constrains tactics, such as working under a lantern during dust storms, and the apple tree cradle acts as a micro-setting that reweights the climax. POV bias filters description through Mira's observational priorities, avoiding generic postcard imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth versus lies escalates through Mira's agency in reassembling the map and confronting the diamond, narrowing options under the causal lens. The cost is legible in her decision to share the secret and protect the stillpoint, foreclosing exploitation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the diagram emerges, deepening knowledge and altering tactics. No coincidental resolution; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of truth emerging from stillness is earned through concrete events like the diamond's inscription and the orchard's transformation, avoiding moralizing. Subtext operates in the cursed rumor as smokescreen and the final image of sanctuary. The non-literal answer to the central question resonates without abstraction, though the inscription slightly echoes thematic statement. Emotional aftereffect lingers through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in Mira's observational voice and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue with allies is natural and goal-driven, advancing plot without register mismatch. Purposeful elision in the letters' reassembly is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or distance issues; prose reflects her mindset consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language ("scarred like a wounded star") is cohesive and voice-motivated. Momentum is maintained through concise, sensory-driven sentences, and the closure image is clear. Minor register drift in "excavate truth" is negligible and does not harm peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of cursed diamond and mental stillpoint feels inevitable and fresh, transforming tropes through specific world logic and character choice. Risk-taking in redefining the stillpoint as a state heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity and conceptual integrity are evident, with no derivative echoes. The closure reconfigures prior material with ingenuity.</comment>
