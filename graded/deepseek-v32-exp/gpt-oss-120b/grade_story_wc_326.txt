<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her identity as a death-certificate error survivor, driving her to confront the digital ghost. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion shown through actions like handling the porcelain shard. The final realization that the ghost is a mirror feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her altered perspective. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; micro-choices under pressure reveal her values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with Mara's understanding that the ghost reflects her miscounted beats, reconfiguring meaning with felt cost. The Hybrid lens (causal-textural) holds, with Mara's actions driving the resolution. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the defragmentation process tightens options coherently. The final image of her heart aligning with the universe's song charges the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The opal observatory and snowfall create a vivid, pressurized setting that isolates Mara and influences her choices. The porcelain shard functions as micro-setting, constraining tactics by serving as a conduit for the algorithm. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's POV, such as the "cold as winter" shard and "midnight ink" patterns. The environment charges the final image with the observatory's glow beneath the aurora.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Mara's correct identity and wisdom from failure, signaled early and escalated through her agency in using the shard and ink to defragment the ghost. Under the Hybrid lens, pressure tightens as the ink patterns identify corrupted code, narrowing options with a cost legible in the sync of heartbeats. The resolution is earned by her alteration, not coincidence, and the final choice forecloses the path of false death.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events: wisdom from failure is shown through Mara's interaction with the digital ghost, not stated. Subtext operates in the ghost as a mirror of bureaucratic error, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the shard holding meaning. No moralizing; the final image reweights prior material without abstraction, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in Mara's poetic, technical voice. Narration remains character-bound, with no head-hopping; elision (e.g., the ghost's whispers) is taught and pays off at closure. Rhythm modulates with pressure, such as the "soft dialogue between flesh and code," and diction stays within Mara's lexicon despite lyrical flourishes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language (e.g., "frozen lantern," "cascade of code") is purposeful and coherent, avoiding muddle. Read-aloud flow is smooth, and line-level craft supports propulsion, as in the climax where ink patterns lead to synchronization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of digital ghost and bureaucratic error, transformed through specific details like the ink-based algorithm and porcelain shard. Emotional truth arises from Mara's struggle, and risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry. The closure feels inevitable in hindsight, with the shard rewriting destiny as a non-obvious inflection.</comment>
