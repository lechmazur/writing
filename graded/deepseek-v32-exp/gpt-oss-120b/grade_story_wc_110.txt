<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with micro-choices like using the lens showing agency. However, emotional depth remains somewhat abstract, lacking contradictory impulses in scene, though her final renunciation as illuminator is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, as the town's transformation and Mara's peace are legible with conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored early, and causality coheres through the doodles-lens-progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the forecourt and lens constraining choices and charging the final image. The environment pressures the narrative through puddles and projections, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative lens, using the lens to amplify honesty, with cost visible in the town's collective sigh. Stakes are clear and tighten meaningfully, though the escalation is more gradual than causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of honesty freeing mistrust emerges organically through images and events, with subtext in light/shadow motifs. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctively poetic, with a perceptual signature in rhythmic prose and controlled elision. No head-hopping; diction consistently matches the lyrical tone under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with varied rhythm, though minor repetition of "ambiguously clear" occurs. No major artifacts obscure closure; line-level craft supports momentum and clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and ingeniously synthesized, transforming tropes through specific details like the lens and doodles. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
