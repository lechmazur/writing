<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Chef Lir's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, but lacks contradictory impulses in scene, preventing higher score despite earned closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost (fortress brittleness), anchored early, and persistent constraint of remorse shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the pavilion and tidal pools constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details are POV-filtered and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (healing remorse) escalate under accumulative lens via Lir's agency; cost is legible in the fortress's brittle state post-transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and redemption emerges through images and action, with a resonant, non-literal answer in the sandstorm carrying away remorse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; poetic voice modulates with pressure without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high density and propulsion, with varied rhythm and no major artifacts; figurative language is coherent and supports closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes memory-tasting, contagious remorse, and tidal analysis with originality; risk-taking in concept feels inevitable and heightens stakes.</comment>
