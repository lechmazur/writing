<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, and the final realization is earned with cost. However, lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, slightly reducing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the kingdom's transformation and cartographer's insight under a causal lens; cost is legible in the efforts and outcomes, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices (e.g., spire's ledge for drafting, frozen lake as mirror) and charging the final image with symbolic weight; sensory details are selective and integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear with famine threat; escalation is driven by cartographer's agency in modeling and implementation, with cost visible in cultivation and energy capture. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of ignorance as canvas for change emerges through events and images; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctively imaginative with perceptual signature; no head-hopping; prose reflects the cartographer's perspective consistently under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and rhythmic with high information density; no major artifacts or loops; clarity maintained even in descriptive passages, though minor overwriting risks exist.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of ignorance cartographer is fresh and organic; synthesis of mythic and empirical elements feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
