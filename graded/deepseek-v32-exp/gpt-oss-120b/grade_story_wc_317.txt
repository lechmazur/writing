<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot from curiosity to innovation. Her interiority is present but could be more embodied; emotions like triumph are shown rather than deeply felt. The final choice to integrate the seed is earned through prior actions, with cost in the awe of the bloom, but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (the flower's bloom) and felt cost (awe and triumph) under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and plot progresses logically from seed arrival to design execution. The seed's receptivity constrains tactics, and causality holds without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly described with sensory details (rain, brook, scent) that create atmosphere and constrain choices through the room's design with vents and skylight. The environment charges the final image of the bloom, integrating purposefully with the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seed blooming through puzzles) escalates under causal lens via participant agency and Mara's design, leading to a cost-legible climax (gasp of awe). However, escalation relies partly on off-page participants, slightly diluting protagonist-driven pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of innovation and nature emerges organically from events and imagery, with subtext in the seed's growth through stories. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the bloom, avoiding moralizing and reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic perceptual signature through Mara's observations. Voice is consistent and rhythmic, though no dialogue is present. Elision is purposeful, and closure remains legible without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with varied syntax and high information density, advancing story and atmosphere. No significant loops or artifacts; rhythm supports momentum, and figurative language is coherent without muddling peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes escape room and living puzzle uniquely, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Specific details (seed, design) avoid derivative tropes, and risk-taking in blending genres heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
