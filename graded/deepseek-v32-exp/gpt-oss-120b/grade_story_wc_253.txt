<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to cultivate lightness in grief is clear and intensifies under pressure, with concrete interiority and micro-choices that reveal her values. Her final renunciation of despair for purposeful art is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the emotional void expansion. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her blank-faced expression charged with ambiguous purpose, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the farmhouse's new rhythm honors joy and grief, with felt cost in Mara's thin smile and the turbines' indifferent spin. The accumulative/textural lens holds, tightening through patterned repetition of whittling and narration. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the closure unit reweights prior material without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting vividly pressures choices—wind turbines hum and cast shadows, influencing Mara's actions and the farmhouse's atmosphere. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like the cedar's scent and brittle petals, filtered through Mara's POV. The turbines and baton constrain choices and charge the final image, with spatial choreography coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens occurs through density increases in Mara's narration and whittling, reweighting the stake of grief versus lightness. Protagonist agency drives the deepening, with cost legible in the hollow void and the baton's declaration. One meaningful tightening forecloses despair, though the climax lacks a sharp reversal, keeping it below 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images—grief and lightness coexist through art—without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the dried flowers' decay holding stories, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the baton and bouquet. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality, with plausible ambiguity in Mara's morally ambiguous purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in Mara's poetic, emotionless narration. Voice modulates under pressure, such as the low rise in her dialogue-like declarations, and elision (e.g., the mandate's backstory) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction remains consistent with her performer lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("shavings fell like snow") is purposeful and coherent, and syntax varies naturally. No register drift or artifacts obscure closure; the final image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of dystopian mandate with quiet art, transforming tropes through specific details like wind turbines and whittling. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
