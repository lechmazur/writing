<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her traits, intensifying to compel her realization. Her internal shift from seeking to offering is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her weathered innocence melting into resolve. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her reticence versus her stubborn pursuit, embodied in micro-choices like testifying through the crystal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Mara's quiet resolve and the crystal's echo. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory patterns to her realization. Orientation is clear early, and the crystal's fractured sequences encode growth, shaping the ending without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospherically rich, with the library and crystal constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "must of old paper" and "sonically reflective shards" are purposeful and filtered through Mara's POV, evolving to mirror her internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative lens, as her testimony and interpretation deepen stakes toward the realization of language's living pulse. Cost is legible in her weathered innocence transforming into resolve, foreclosing her prior path with visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the crystal encoding language growth, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to decay and rebirth. Subtext operates in gestures like leaving the offering, avoiding moralizing while inviting reflection through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature that reflects Mara's scholarly mindset. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision (e.g., fractured sequences) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "fractured sequences that fractured time" is coherent and purposeful, though minor density in peak beats slightly reduces propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of language growth and memory, with specific details like the crystal as a witness transforming familiar tropes. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
