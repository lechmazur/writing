<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Guard's motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure; final renunciation of dreamlessness is earned, though some abstract phrasing slightly dulls peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost in the world's renewal; orientation is clear early, and the chess clock's tick backward charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the dune and terminal constraining choices and charging the closure; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes of renewal escalate through guard's agency under accumulative lens; cost is legible in the transformation, with one meaningful tightening as sparks bloom into new forests.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of renewal emerges through images and action, not statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with purposeful ambiguity, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; poetic voice and rhythmic control heighten pressure without head-hopping, though minor register consistency issues exist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; minor overwriting in figurative language doesn't obscure closure, and no loops or artifacts harm causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes elements freshly with risk-taking; specific details and transformed tropes create inevitability, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
