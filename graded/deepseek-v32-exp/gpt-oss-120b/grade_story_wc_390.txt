<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's "logically emotional" trait is consistently shown through her analytical methods and embodied emotions, driving key choices like the frequency alignment. However, the emotional resolution feels slightly tidy with the tear and absolution, leaning toward sentimentality without deeper contradiction. The final choice is earned by prior causality, but the internal conflict could be more dynamically opposed in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear causal chain under the inferred lens, with orientation anchored early. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost (Elara's tear and redemption), but the prose overwriting in phrases like "fleshly ethereal glow" slightly dulls the closure image, capping the score due to Q7<8.2 gate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the ice humming affecting the resonance alignment. The drift-ice marina and lighthouse micro-setting charge the final image, but some descriptions like "fleshly ethereal" introduce minor incoherence, preventing higher bands.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes around protecting the artifact escalate through Elara's agency in vibrational matching, narrowing options with a legible cost at closure. However, the escalation is somewhat linear without significant tightening of trade-offs, and the Q7 cap applies.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of sonic absolution emerges organically from events and images, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the crystal's hum, but the concept could be more deeply integrated with character struggle beyond surface paradox.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and stable with a poetic-analytical blend fitting Elara's POV. No head-hopping; rhythmic control supports pressure, though minor register drift in phrases like "fleshly ethereal" slightly reduces consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and often lyrical, but overwriting in peaks (e.g., "fleshly ethereal glow" as a mixed metaphor) causes minor clarity issues. No major loops or scaffolds, and momentum is maintained, though figurative muddle in key beats prevents higher scores.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse engineering, sonic absolution, and vibrational matching feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in tone and concept. However, some elements like the timeframe are underutilized, limiting full ingenuity.</comment>
