<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and rooted in yearning for an encore, with concrete interiority and embodied emotions. The ghost's final choice to amplify echoes and achieve peace is earned, though internal contradiction is minimal, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as the ghost's essence expands and he finds peace, under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the tarot coin and orchard shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the orchard and coin constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start, and escalation is driven by the ghost's agency in producing echoes, leading to a resonant reconfiguration with legible cost. Under the accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, though it lacks causal tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hope and nostalgia emerges organically from events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through implication in the orchard's response and the ghost's transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct with synesthetic elements, maintaining a consistent perceptual signature. Dialogue is minimal but natural, and rhythmic control supports pressure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm, avoiding loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats, though minor ornamentation prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of ghost, tarot coin, and orchard feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the lyrical style that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation of tropes through specific details is evident.</comment>
