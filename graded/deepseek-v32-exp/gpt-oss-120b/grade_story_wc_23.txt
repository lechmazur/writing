<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Navigator's motivation is stark and consistent, with embodied emotion in lines like "eyes sewn together from half-remembered maps," but internal contradiction is underdeveloped, limiting peak complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in "steady acceptance" and ships appearing, under accumulative lens; censer foot and moon phases shape tactics cohesively.</comment>
