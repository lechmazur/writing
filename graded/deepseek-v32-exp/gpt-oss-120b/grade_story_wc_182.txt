<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Selene's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot with her arcane linguist skills. However, internal conflict is minimal, and emotional depth is subdued, lacking contradictory impulses under pressure. The final choice is earned by prior causality, but cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the library's activation and the time traveler's confirmation, altering the future with legible cost under a causal lens.

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of unlearned lessons and listening to silence, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.
