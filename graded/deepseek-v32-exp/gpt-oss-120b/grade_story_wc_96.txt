<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is vivid with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure; her molting personalities enable fresh insights that drive the rebellion. Rook is less developed but serves as a functional foil. The final choice to rebuild the library is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the transformation. Minor deduction for secondary character flatness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative lens, with the library becoming a sanctuary of hope; cost is legible in the effort and growth. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The coffee tin's introduction and the rebuilding sequence create coherent linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rusted library constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "veins of light" integrated into action. Setting evolves causally, supporting the theme. Micro-setting elements (e.g., seed packets in cracks) alter tactics and deepen atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency in rebuilding and planting seeds, reweighting stakes with visible cost. Dominant stake of resistance is signaled early and tightens through collective action. No coincidental resolutions; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of forging beauty from anarchy emerges through particulars like seed planting and shelf repair, with subtext in symbols. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and earned through scene work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctively poetic, with rhythmic control and perceptual signature. Dialogue is minimal but natural; elision is taught and pays off. No head-hopping or register drift, even under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language pattern-taught and cohesive. Minor overwriting in peaks (e.g., "luminous fracture") but no artifacts that obscure closure. Sentences advance story efficiently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details like personality molting and seed packets. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh inflection in the library's transformation charges closure.</comment>
