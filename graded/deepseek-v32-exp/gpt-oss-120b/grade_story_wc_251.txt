<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her actions from the magnetic grotto to the window displays. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like cradling the grotto "as if it were a newborn rebellion." However, her gift of hearing unspoken words remains abstract without on-page demonstration, slightly weakening character-particular depth under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, with closure achieved through the town's transformation and the library's mist settling into "a calm that whispered." Cost is legible in the community's shift from doubt to action, though the conceptual price is more implied than felt. Structure is coherent with mosaic elements (library, windows, town) taught early and transitions legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like "dust danced like quiet fireflies" and the "amber glow" of windows, filtering through POV. The library and mist atmosphere pressure choices, but the magnetic grotto as a micro-setting charges the final image more than constraining tactics, limiting higher-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake against rote learning escalates through Mara's agency in organizing window displays, leading to community action like planting saplings. Escalation is driven under accumulative lens, with cost legible in the "shared secret" and changed behaviors, but the price remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of quiet rebellion emerges through concrete images like chess pieces and saplings, with subtext in "unvoiced dialogue" and the final line "The quiet has spoken." Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though some metaphors (e.g., "forests of second thoughts") edge toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, evident in rhythmic control like "the mist swirled tighter" and perceptual specificity in noticing "stray metal like a compass pulls iron." No head-hopping; elision (e.g., the rebellion's spread) is taught and paid off at closure with heightened pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, but figurative language occasionally muddles clarity, e.g., "planting forests of second thoughts" mixed with literal saplings. No major artifacts; sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative build, though minor redundancy in "quiet revolution" and "quiet storm" slightly dulls momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of chess, magnetic grotto, and synchronized displays feels inevitable, transforming the rebellion trope through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure image reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
