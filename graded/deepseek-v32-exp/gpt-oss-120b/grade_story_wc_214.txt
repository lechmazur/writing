<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority; the janitor's motivation to empathize with stars drives micro-choices under pressure, and the final vow earns a resonant reconfiguration of vulnerability into strength with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive conceptual repricing via the tremor and vow, cost is legible on-page; accumulative/textural lens holds consistently, with the station's constraint shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and POV-filtered; the station and lantern function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the closure, with sensory detail woven seamlessly into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes of finding strength in vulnerability escalate through the janitor's agency under the accumulative lens; the vow and tremor represent a meaningful deepening with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of flourishing stillness emerges organically through images and events; the ending offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing, rooted in the janitor's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetically controlled with a consistent perceptual signature; POV is stable, and elision is purposeful, enhancing the accumulative drive without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety; no loops or artifacts obscure clarity, and figurative language supports pressure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cosmic janitor and empathy for stars feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet, internal narrative heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure is fully integrated.</comment>
