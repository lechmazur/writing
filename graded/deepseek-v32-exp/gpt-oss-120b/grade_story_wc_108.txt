<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and contradictory, showing fear versus rehearsed bravado. Her final transformation is earned by prior causality, with cost in betraying her hidden self. Micro-choices under pressure, like decoding notes, reveal values. Slight diagnostic self-awareness in "betrayal of the self" but dramatized with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages from discovery to transformation. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost in "the betrayal of the self I had hidden for years." Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraint of fear shapes tactics. No causality breaks; closure lands powerfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the rusted library and constellations filtering through Mara's POV. The library constrains choice via the collapse mechanism, charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and urgent, e.g., "cracked dome let in constellations." Micro-setting elements like the seashell and lever alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of overcoming fear escalates under causal lens through Mara's agency in decoding and stepping on the lever. Cost is legible in the vial's price of self-betrayal. One meaningful tightening forecloses options, but escalation is slightly abstract at points. Protagonist drives escalation with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability as power emerges organically through events like decoding and the vial's price, not direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "every betrayal can be turned into a beacon." Subtext in seashell whispers and constellation rearrangement avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "library’s cracked dome let in constellations that seemed to chart a map." Voice is poetic and consistent, though slightly overwritten in peaks. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with strong rhythm, but some figurative language in high-pressure beats approaches overwriting without muddling clarity. No major loops or scaffolds; information density is high. Sentence propulsion varies naturally, supporting momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of stunt double phobias and mythical elements feels organic and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific choices like decoding with stunt moves. Risk-taking in poetic density heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh angle on vulnerability.</comment>
