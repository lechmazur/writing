<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to understand emotion mathematics is clear and consistent, driving her actions like borrowing personalities and transposing feelings. Interiority is concrete through embodied pulses and rhythmic alignments, and her final realization is earned by prior causality with the halo fragment's cracking as cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws like deliberate self-disorientation compound the quest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the halo fragment cracks, releasing light and proving her theorem, with cost legible in the shards collected. Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through patterned empathy and imagery. Orientation is clear early with Mara in the topaz workshop under stars, and causality coheres without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with topaz walls pulsing violet and the halo fragment on a brass cradle constraining choices by refracting light for equations. Sensory details like ink and trembling dome reflect Mara's POV, charging the final image. However, some descriptions lean abstract, slightly reducing tactile immediacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake in understanding emotion mathematics escalates through Mara's agency: transposing feelings, the room shivering, and halo cracking. Cost is unmistakable in the fragment's destruction under Accumulative lens, forcing her to continue with shards. One meaningful tightening forecloses easy resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transposed empathy and emotion as mathematics emerges through specifics like borrowed personalities and numerical patterns, not statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the cracking halo and collected shards, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in imagery and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct poetic voice, reflected in rhythmic prose and perceptual bias toward emotion and ink. No head-hopping; elision like "lucid turbulence" is taught and pays off at closure. Diction remains within Mara's lexicon, though some density may challenge immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story through concrete images. Minor overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "storm of thoughts") but no major loops or scaffolds. Clarity maintained in peak beats like the halo cracking, with purposeful compression.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of letterpress operation with halo fragment and emotion mathematics feels inevitable, transforming tropes through grounded details like copper impressions and borrowed poets. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure integrates concept fully.</comment>
