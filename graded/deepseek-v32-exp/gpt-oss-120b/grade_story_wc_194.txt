<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lian's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. However, internal contradiction or contradictory impulses are not deeply explored in scene, limiting the peak characterization. The final discovery is earned through prior causality, but the emotional cost lacks layered complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with Lian uncovering the scroll and reconfiguring his understanding of his dynasty's fall, with felt cost in the revelation of betrayal. The causal lens holds tightly from the gramophone's use to the discovery, and orientation is anchored early. The standing waves and gramophone act as persistent constraints shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sepia reading room and gramophone are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail, constraining choices and charging the final image. The environment pressures Lian's actions, such as listening at the carved panel, and the golden shadows evolve to mirror internal shifts. Specificity is purposeful and integrated into the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled with Lian's goal to uncover the truth, escalating through his agency in using the gramophone and following the standing waves. The cost is legible in the emotional weight of the confession. However, the escalation relies on a single tightening without deeper trade-offs or secondary pressures.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of silence, intuition, and history, with subtext in the gramophone's resonant tones and the final realization about eloquence. The ending offers a non-literal answer without moralizing, rewarding attentive listening. Motifs like the bridge of intuition are woven into the narrative fabric.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, rhythmic voice that reflects Lian's scholarly perspective. The prose maintains a consistent perceptual signature under pressure, and elision (e.g., the gramophone's mechanics) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift disrupts the focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language that enhances atmosphere without muddle. Sentences advance story and character seamlessly, and there are no loops or scaffold artifacts. The closure image is sharp and propelled by concise, vivid language.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes historical inquiry with sensory intuition in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming tropes through specific details like the standing waves. Risk-taking in the lyrical mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
