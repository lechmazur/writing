<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices like turning the coin. However, internal conflict between doubt and enthusiasm is more summarized than simultaneously acted in scene, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Silas realizes purpose is a frequency, with cost legible in the deck's cracking and void's whisper. Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory-rich setting (ambered deck, violet mist) constrains choice through the coins and deck's cracking, charging the final image. Details are selective and purposeful, integrated with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Silas's agency in distilling murmurs and decoding static bursts, under Accumulative lens, with cost felt in the alignment and deck's fracture. Stakes are clear and tighten meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of purpose as frequency emerges organically from coins, prophecy, and static bursts, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (cosmic, poetic voice) and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cosmic prophecy, static bursts, and coins feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric style heightening stakes. Specific details like foreign coins avoid template plots.</comment>
