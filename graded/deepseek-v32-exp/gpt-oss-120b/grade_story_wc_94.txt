<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion like "furiously tranquil." The poet's final understanding of scars as a terrain to traverse is earned through the vigil, but lacks deep internal contradiction or conflicting impulses under pressure, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing where the poet reconfigures scars as a map to be traversed, with cost legible in the transformation of sorrow. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, building through imagery and ritual, and orientation is clear early with the stormlit observatory setting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the stormlit observatory and storm actively constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "electric scent of ozone" are vivid and purposeful, woven into action and reflecting the poet's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the poet's agency in setting the timer and performing the vigil, under the accumulative lens, with cost unmistakable in the rarefaction of sorrow. Stakes are clearly signaled and deepen through the storm's intensity, but the pressure lacks a tightening turn that forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images like the timer and scars, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in the ritual and objects deepens meaning, and the ending reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctively poetic, with a perceptual signature that filters setting through the poet's lens. Rhythm and diction control under pressure, such as "furiously tranquil," enhance the accumulative drive without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm, but minor overwriting in phrases like "cartography of scars on humanity's soul" slightly blurs momentum. No major artifacts, loops, or scaffold; clarity is maintained at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is highly original, synthesizing the vigil, timer, and scars into a fresh, inevitable whole. Risk-taking in poetic style and metaphor transformation heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure effect is fully integrated.</comment>
