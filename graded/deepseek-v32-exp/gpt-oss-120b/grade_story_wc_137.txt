<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's interior contradiction between skepticism and wonder is embodied in micro-choices like offering tea to the wind and disciplined transcription, earning her final renunciation. Her courageously kind trait constrains actions with visible cost, such as whispering apologies to the stars, and the closure choice to place the tile is motivated by prior causality. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through specific, concrete perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Lira's peace and the tile's steady glow, reconfiguring doubt and wonder under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the pattern of tile shifts and whale migration coheres without causality breaks. The final image of the alcove as a sanctuary charges the ending with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The stargazer's tower and magic tile function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image, with sensory details like "sea breathed mist" and "ink that shimmered" woven into action. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment pressures Lira's transcription, influencing the closure. Specificity is purposeful, avoiding generic placeholder description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative/Textural lens is driven by Lira's agency in transcribing memories, with density increasing through tile shifts and whale songs, leading to a cost legible in her transformed skepticism. The dominant stake of internal conflict tightens through patterned deepening, though the absence of external antagonism limits peak pressure. Closure forecloses a path with visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of doubt and wonder entwining emerges through particulars like the tile's patterns and whale migration, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like offering tea and the unheard symphony, with the final image reweighting prior material. No thematic echo or sermonizing; complexity is embraced through concrete events.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical syntax and rhythmic control under pressure, such as "the tower seemed to inhale the sea’s memory." Purposeful elision in the tile's mechanics is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; voice modulates with emotional intensity without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "ribs of a whale’s heart" is coherent and purposeful, though minor overwriting risk exists in peak beats without obscuring clarity. No template cadence or synonym churn; propulsion is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of skeptical character, magic tile, and whale migration feels organic and non-obvious, transforming tropes through specific grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure reconfigures meaning with inevitability. No derivative premise; emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
