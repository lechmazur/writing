<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving key choices like ringing the bell. Interiority is concrete, with micro-choices under pressure, but lacks deeper internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final endurance feels earned, with cost in responsibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the bell's echo symbolizing hope and endurance; cost is felt in the community's isolation. Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through repetition. Orientation is clear early, and causality is intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the terra-cotta arbor and bell constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "amplified quiet" are selective and integrated into action, reflecting POV bias and urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (feeding the community) escalates under the Accumulative lens through Mara's agency, with cost legible in the risk of patrols. One meaningful tightening occurs as the bell's rhythm steadies hearts, narrowing options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of solidarity emerges from events and images like the bell and anonymous donations, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, and the ending reweights prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and controlled under pressure, with rhythmic prose. No head-hopping or elision issues; diction remains consistent and character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no major artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, though minor overwriting exists in peaks without harming closure. No loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of exile and community resilience, with specific details like the bell creating inevitability. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional truth avoids templates.</comment>
