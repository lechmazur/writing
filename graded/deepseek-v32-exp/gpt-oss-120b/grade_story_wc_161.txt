<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is clear and intensifies, from reinventing personal history to preserving lost songs, with embodied micro-choices like attaching meteorite chips to pigeons. Internal conflict between loss and trust is shown in scene, and her final stance is earned through causality with visible cost in the map's glow. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws like past grief complicate choices credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the map glows and Lila feels the past loosen, with cost legible in the "inevitable wilt of memory." Inferred accumulative/textural lens holds, with patterns of dust, pigeons, and maps building to a meaningful deepening. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the attic's skylight and dust motes constraining Lila's choice to map paper trails, charging the final image of the glowing map. Sensory details like "scent of old paper" and "dust turned to gold" are selective and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment evolves with the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Lila's agency, as mapping dust and attaching meteorite chips to pigeons deepen the stake of preserving lost songs, with cost felt in her emotional journey. One meaningful tightening occurs as the paper trails interweave and the meteorite's glow deepens, narrowing options toward closure. No coincidental resolutions; pressure coheres until the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of balance between loss and renewal emerges organically from particulars like dust swirls and pigeon flights, without direct statement. Subtext operates in images such as the meteorite's "celestial lullaby," and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the glowing map. No moralizing or thematic echo; complexity embraces ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, as Lila's voice poetically filters details like "dust motes into a slow, luminous whirl." No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, such as the taught pattern of dust mapping paying off at closure. Rhythm and syntax modulate with emotional intensity, though dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "bloom with a withering grace" is coherent and voice-motivated. No register drift or template cadence; clarity and propulsion are maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of courier pigeons, meteorite chips, and dust mapping to explore memory, with risk-taking in the accumulative structure. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight, transformed through specific details like the meteorite's hum. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, and the closure image recharges prior material.</comment>
