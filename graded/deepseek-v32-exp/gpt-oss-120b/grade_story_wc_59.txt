<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prince's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His transformation from bedraggled to radiant is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the closure. However, minor abstraction in emotional portrayal prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the phoenix's hatching, reconfiguring the palace and prince under a causal lens that holds throughout. Cost is legible in the prince's flaw melting away and the palace's transformation. The plot is tightly linked with no orientation issues or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The suspended palace setting is vivid and sensory, with stalactites and mechanical elements constraining choices and charging the final image. Specific details like the cradle placement under stalactites alter tactics, integrating setting into action and theme seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the prince's agency in assembling the cradle, leading to a meaningful tightening under the causal lens. Cost is unmistakable in the personal and environmental transformation, with the dominant stake of reawakening beauty driving the narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and imagery, such as the egg and phoenix symbolizing rebirth, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of flawed genesis and redemption, with rich subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and perceptual signature reflecting the prince's worldview. Prose rhythm and diction are controlled under pressure, though minor lushness doesn't obscure clarity. No head-hopping or dialogue issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though slight overwriting in peak beats prevents a higher score. Closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh specificity, such as the suspended palace and mechanical world, transformed through character choices and thematic depth. Risk-taking in prose and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
