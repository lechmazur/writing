<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Liora's altruistic motivation is clear but static; she lacks internal contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure, reducing depth. The villagers are functional secondary characters but do not undergo meaningful change. The ghost's trustworthiness enables plot moves but is not tested with personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as the bell's chime amplifies hope and reconfigures community unity; cost is legible in the collective promise to share resources. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The orchard planet setting is vividly specific with sensory details (floating rock arches, firefly nebula) that charge the final image; the bell and nebula constrain the climax by focusing the collective action. Micro-setting elements are integrated into choice and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of community hope escalates through collective agency under the Accumulative lens, with a meaningful tightening as the bell ringing reweights options; cost is visible in the villagers' effort and the promised ongoing care. No personal conflict, but appropriate for the scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of unity and cooperation emerges organically from concrete actions (chalk messages, bell lifting) without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of sustained sanctuary. Subtext operates in Liora's whispers and the community's response.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person with a poetic, consistent voice; perceptual signature is distinct in Liora's ethereal perspective and the villagers' grounded reactions. Dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision (e.g., chalk messages) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with varied rhythm and high information density; no loops or artifacts obscure clarity. Figurative language ("brambled hope") is purposeful and coherent, supporting momentum without overwriting in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost, orchard planet, and collective ritual feels fresh and inevitable; tropes are transformed through specific world-building (singing rock arches, firefly nebula) and emotional truth. Risk-taking in tone and setting heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
