<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The gentle radical's motivation is clear and drives the plot, but interiority relies on abstract labels like "retrocognitively trapped" rather than embodied contradiction. Micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing the stone, reveal values, but emotional depth is told more than shown through specific, irrational impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing via the renaming, healing the sky with cost in the "scorching grief" cooled. Accumulative lens holds through patterned imagery, and orientation is clear early. The tessera's pulse reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details (ash, soot-gray stones) and the mosaic stepping stone constrains the key choice, charging the final image. The plaza acts as a micro-setting that alters tactics, and sensory selection reflects POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with the renaming tightening stakes and delivering cost in the "warm coldness." Dominant stake in healing grief deepens through a single meaningful turn that forecloses options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of aberrant mercy emerges organically from images like "Hearthsteel," offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in "warm coldness" and steel-strong empathy invites complexity, though some abstraction lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic rhythm and perceptual signature ("air tasted of ash"). No head-hopping; purposeful compression supports accumulative design. Elision in memory loops is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose has high density and varied rhythm, but minor overwriting occurs in peaks (e.g., "voice of the stone demanded a rename" risks muddle). No major loops or artifacts; propulsion remains clear, and closure image is undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic empathy with poetic risk, transforming tropes through specific details like the mosaic. However, the core premise echoes familiar redemption arcs, limiting ingenuity to strong but not rare execution.</comment>
