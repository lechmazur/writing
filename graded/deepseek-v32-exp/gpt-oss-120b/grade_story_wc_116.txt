<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The keeper's motivation to seek regenerative silence is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion in lines like "erasing the weight of centuries." His final choice to step into the refuge is earned by prior causality, and the cost of dissolved thoughts is visible. Contradictory impulses between witnessing and seeking renewal are dramatized, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as the keeper finds peace and writes "silence births renewal," with cost legible in the "weight of centuries" erased. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, driven by sensory density and cadence shifts. The origami swan map provides coherent causality, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "scent of damp parchment" and the obsidian refuge charging the final image. The library and river constrain choices, such as burrowing through tunnels. Environment shapes tactics and closure, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes around regenerative silence escalate through the keeper's agency in burrowing and using the origami swan, narrowing options under the accumulative lens. Cost is felt in the dissolution of thoughts and "fleeting peace." One meaningful tightening occurs, but the escalation is slightly muted by passive elements.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence and renewal emerges organically from images and actions, with subtext in the keeper's journey. The final line "silence births renewal" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Earned through concrete experience, it reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, reflected in rhythmic prose and perceptual specificity like "memory to slip like water." No head-hopping; elision (e.g., origami folds) is taught and pays off. Diction remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no significant loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "pulsing like a heartbeat" is coherent and purposeful. Minor overwriting in phrases like "regenerative silence" occurs but doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes mystical elements with fresh specificity, such as the origami swan map and obsidian refuge. Emotional truth in the quest for peace feels inevitable, and risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transforms familiar tropes through grounded details.</comment>
