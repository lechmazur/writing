<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Selric's motivation is clear and consistent, driving his actions from unstrapping to mist walking. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion like the luminance pulsing with his heartbeat. The final change is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the dissolution of his reputation and the ignition of his magic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with Selric's magic igniting and his realization about the sacred, under a causal lens that holds throughout. Cost is legible in the warming glow and reconfigured stance. Orientation is anchored early, and the keystone's persistent constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The icebound spire and mist constrain choices, charging the final image with the keystone's glow. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, such as the "luminous fog" and "icy walls," integrated into action and reflecting Selric's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Selric's agency—unstrapping, mist walking, touching the keystone—narrowing options and raising stakes under the causal lens. Cost is unmistakable in the magic's ignition and the reconfigured purpose, foreclosing his old path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, with the sacred in the simple realized through Selric's journey and the keystone's glow. Subtext operates in images like mist and luminance, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic diction and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice remains consistent, and elision (e.g., the automated cities) is taught and pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats, and propulsion advances story and atmosphere seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis transforms tropes through specific choices like the lingering luminance and mist walking, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
