<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her trait of being "quietly inspired," intensifying under pressure. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion shown through actions like whispering to the echo. The final choice to step onto the sand bridge is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Mara understands her purpose and the world changes. The cost is legible in the "heartbeat of ancient wisdom" and the cliffs listening. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The amber warehouse and cliffs pressure choices, constraining Mara's actions with the hourglass and buttons. Sensory details like "amber glow" and "roar" are selective and purposeful, charging the final image of the sand bridge. The environment is integral to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency in cataloging buttons and using the echo, narrowing options under the Accumulative lens. The cost is felt in the "weight of each grain" and the prophecy's unscrambling. One meaningful tightening occurs as the buttons shape the river.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of shared wisdom emerges through particulars like the buttons and echo, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in "the world could change when its keepers turned time with care," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Mara's poetic observations. Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., "the warehouse seemed to exhale." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language like "thin layer of sunrise" is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle. Sentence propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements like the hourglass turner and echo in a jar feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry. The premise is transformed through specific details and character choices.</comment>
