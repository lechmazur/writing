<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure, but lacks deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses in scene, limiting the earned cost of the final renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with cost legible in the "haunted euphoria" and the archivist's promise, anchored by persistent constraint of the covenant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory detail and micro-setting (jetty, locket) constrain choice and charge the final image; the environment shapes tactics through the act of writing and the sea's response.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens via density increase in imagery and the archivist's agency; cost is felt in the "weight of small moments" and the haunting renewal, though external conflict is minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars like the locket and covenant; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting memory and renewal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable POV with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; poetic voice remains coherent under pressure, and elision (e.g., "proximate causes") is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; no loops or scaffolds, though slight repetition in "haunted euphoria" does not obscure closure or cause figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and specificity anchors the premise uniquely.</comment>
