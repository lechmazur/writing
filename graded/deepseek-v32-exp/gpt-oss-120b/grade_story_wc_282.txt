<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies, with micro-choices under pressure. Interiority is concrete but occasionally abstract in emotional description. The final realization is earned with visible cost, though some emotions edge toward stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost legible in the map maker's understanding. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern taught pays off at the end with the caves "singing."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through POV, with the cave network acting as a micro-setting that shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with cost felt in the transition of the fossil to oracle. Stakes are signaled early and tighten through her actions, foreclosing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext is rich in gestures like the leaf's glow, and the ending reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature in sensory mapping. Prose rhythm controls pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., the method's mechanics) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor figurative overload in peaks, but no major artifacts or loops harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of post-human and sensory elements, transformed through specific details. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
