<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sage's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, but interiority occasionally leans abstract with phrases like "luminous ache," slightly reducing concrete specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as the luminous ache transforms into gratitude, under a coherent accumulative/textural lens; the leaf sound as a persistent constraint shapes tactics and the final image effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lunar observatory setting constrains choice through the leaf sound and charges the final image with the repaired clock as a beacon; sensory details are vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the sage's agency to restructure the mechanism, with cost legible in the deepening luminous ache; stakes are clear and tighten meaningfully under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on change and constancy without moralizing; the ending reweights prior material through the repaired hand's transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a poetic perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure and purposeful elision (e.g., leaf sound) are taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, but minor repetition of "luminous ache" slightly reduces freshness; no figurative muddle or loops harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes cosmic and mechanical elements with inevitability; risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels earned and specific.</comment>
