<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira's curiosity and diligence are consistently shown through micro-choices like tracing the hopscotch board and using the phrasebook, driving the plot. However, no internal contradiction or flaws complicate her actions, limiting depth. Emotions are embodied (e.g., "heart swelling with quiet pride"), but the lack of blind spots or struggle prevents higher scoring. Final choice is earned but without significant cost or conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a resonant reconfiguration: the harnessed luminance syncs with the engine, costing the ship's energy shift ("warm presence"). Accumulative lens holds, building through pattern density. Orientation is clear early (Lira on airship at night). Cost is legible in the final image, and constraints (hopscotch board) shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (brass hull, lantern glow, starling murmurations) and constrains choices: the hopscotch board and copper pipes directly enable the climax. Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered. Micro-setting charges the final image with the luminance's binding, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harnessing luminance for discovery) escalates under accumulative lens through Lira's agency—aligning symbols and phrases tightens options. Cost is legible in the energy trade-off ("without draining the ship’s own life-force"). One meaningful deepening suffices, but lacks high-tension conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of discovery and isolation emerges through particulars like the phrasebook's multilingual clues and the final luminance harness. Subtext in phrases (e.g., "the night sings when the wind listens") avoids moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, reflecting Lira's curiosity through selective perception (e.g., "lantern’s amber breath"). No head-hopping; elision (e.g., phrasebook clues) is taught and paid off. Rhythmic control under pressure supports the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing momentum without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("living constellations") is purposeful, but minor overwriting ("sociable isolation") doesn't harm clarity. No artifacts in peak beats; closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of airship, luminance, and hopscotch board feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like the polyglot phrasebook. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
