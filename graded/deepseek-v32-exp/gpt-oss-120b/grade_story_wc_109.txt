<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The oracle's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. However, internal contradiction is minimal, and the final endurance lacks deep conflict, though cost is visible in the map's dissolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is achieved through Conceptual Repricing as the map dissolves into the marbled hush, with felt cost in integration. The accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, and orientation is clear early, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly atmospheric and constrains choice, such as the storm influencing the oracle's focus. The ridge fort and tools like the booklet charge the final image, with sensory details purposefully integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear in mapping the endless night, escalating through textural density under the accumulative lens. Agency is evident in summarizing silence, with cost legible in the map's dissolution, though external conflict is minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence and void emerges through imagery and action, not statement, with subtext in the mapping process. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the map's integration into the hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctively poetic, with a consistent perceptual signature and rhythmic control. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, but slight repetition of phrases like "ambered hush" may border on overwriting without harming clarity. Propulsion remains strong, and no major artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, transforming tropes through specific details like summarizing silence. Synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
