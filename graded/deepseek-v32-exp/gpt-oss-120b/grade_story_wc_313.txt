<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Caitlyn's motivation is clear and rooted in personal history, driving the narrative, but internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction in scene; emotions like "calm certainty" are told rather than shown under pressure, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as the "weight of truth lift" reconfigures community fear under an accumulative/textural lens; orientation is clear early, and causality through photographs leads to a resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "silver ribbon" and "wind chime," charging the final image of the reservoir revealing memory, but it does not deeply constrain choices beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Caitlyn's agency in following the photograph trail, narrowing options under the accumulative lens; cost is legible in the collective relief, though stakes remain more thematic than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus myth emerges organically through images and events, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the reservoir's transformation; no moralizing, only implied healing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with lyrical perception, such as "water’s memory of storms long past"; no head-hopping, and elision is purposeful, though dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density, advancing story through concrete imagery; no major loops or artifacts, though figurative language like "mirrored hush" risks slight overwriting without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise is fresh with a non-obvious synthesis of myth-investigation through photographs; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
