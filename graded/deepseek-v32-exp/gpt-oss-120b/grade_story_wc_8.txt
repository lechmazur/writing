<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arlen's motivation is clear and consistent, with emotionally rational analysis shown through micro-choices like prying the mailbox. Interiority is concrete, but lacks strong contradictory impulses in scene, preventing higher score. Final choice to place the letter is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual repricing as truth is rescued, cost legible in ivy retreating and sunlight freezing the ink. Accumulative/textural lens holds through imagery and parallels. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraint of noble lies shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with ivy-strangled station and rosebush, constraining choice (mailbox prying) and charging the final image (ivy retreating). Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Arlen's agency under accumulative lens, from finding the letter to realizing parallels and acting. Cost is visible in the transformation, narrowing options. Stakes are dominant and coherent, though one meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of noble lies versus truth emerges organically through parallels and images, not statement. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer with the station's renewal, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct—scholarly, reflective, with controlled rhythm under pressure. Perceptual signature is strong, and elision (e.g., parallels) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with clear propulsion in peak beats like the letter's revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes fictional historian and symbolic quest with specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in blending realism and allegory heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure remains legible.</comment>
