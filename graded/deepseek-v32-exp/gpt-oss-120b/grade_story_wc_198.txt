<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and drives the action, but interiority lacks depth and contradictory impulses under pressure; the saxophonist remains an archetype without embodied flaws or complex internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (vested hush settling) and felt cost (valley saved); accumulative/textural lens holds through imagery buildup; orientation is clear early, and prophecy dissolution is earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory richness (mist, prism light, dewdrops), but it functions more as atmospheric backdrop than a constraint on choices, though it charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (hushing prophecy to prevent storm), and escalation under accumulative lens occurs through density increase in playing; agency is present, but cost is lightly felt rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of silence versus noise emerges organically through events and imagery; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, supported by subtextual layers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic rhythm and perceptual signature; no head-hopping, but capped due to Q2 not reaching 9.0, though elision is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with varied syntax, high information density, and no major loops or artifacts; some stacked metaphors are purposeful and do not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise is highly original with non-obvious synthesis of musician and prophet tropes; risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, but capped due to Q2.</comment>
