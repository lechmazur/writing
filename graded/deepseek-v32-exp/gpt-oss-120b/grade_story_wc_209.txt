<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in childhood curiosity, with embodied emotion in key moments like her tears. However, some emotional phrasing edges toward stock ("umbral tenderness wrapping around her"), slightly reducing specificity under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing under the accumulative/textural lens, with cost legible in Mara's tears and the final image reconfiguring her understanding. The drive lens holds, and orientation is anchored early in the pavilion and cathedral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the cathedral's etched glass constraining choice by revealing the vision, and the amber pavilion charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation deepens through Mara's agency with the postcards and glass, leading to a vision that reweights stakes with cost in her emotional response. One meaningful tightening occurs as the secret unlocks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through the final image of night flowers as a promise. Subtext operates in imagery without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Mara's artist mindset. No head-hopping; elision in the vision sequence is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density, though minor figurative stacking ("umbral tenderness," "phosphorescent rhythm") in peak beats causes slight muddle without harming closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes elements uniquely, with a non-obvious angle on introspection through postcards and glass. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
