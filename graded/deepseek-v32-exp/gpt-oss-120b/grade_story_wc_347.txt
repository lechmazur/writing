<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in the bargain, with interiority shown through embodied emotions like "bitter sweetness that settles like ash." Micro-choices under pressure, such as placing the nut, reveal values, but some emotional descriptions lean slightly abstract, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration: the nut's placement brings light and guides travelers, but the curse persists, costing the caretaker repetition. The causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages, and cost is legible in "the orchard will sigh again tomorrow."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the cliffside labyrinth and mechanical birds constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "frost threatens to seize the air" are integrated into action, and the environment shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early, with escalation driven by the timeframe (before frost) and the caretaker's agency in assembling clues and performing the ritual. Cost is visible in the orchard's shudder and the cyclical nature, though the escalation is slightly muted in middle beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, exploring sacrifice and redemption through images like "graceless beauty" and the orchard's sigh. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, with subtext in the bittersweet resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature in phrases like "jagged elegance." Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and elision (e.g., the blueprint's details) is taught and paid off, though minor register consistency holds it back from 9+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No major artifacts or loops; figurative language is purposeful, though "graceless beauty" repetition is slightly noticeable but thematic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and specific, synthesizing cursed orchard, mechanical birds, and ritual into a non-obvious whole. Emotional truth and risk-taking in tone heighten stakes, and the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
