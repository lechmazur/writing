<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The titan's motivation is clear and drives the plot, but interiority lacks concrete embodiment and contradictory impulses; emotions are described but not deeply felt under pressure, limiting character depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is decisive with cost (temple collapse, pretender fading), causal lens holds tightly, and orientation is clear early; the rune and ink pellet create persistent constraints that shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral to choices, constraining movement and charging the final image with collapse; sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through titan's agency under causal lens, with cost legible in collapse and spent pellet; one meaningful tightening forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of truth vs. deceit emerges through events and images without moralizing; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via crown and collapse, but slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature; no head-hopping, and elision (e.g., rune's function) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds, and figurative language supports clarity and propulsion, especially in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and transformation of tropes is specific.</comment>
