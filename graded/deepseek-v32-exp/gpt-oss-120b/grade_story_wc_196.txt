<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Amelia's motivation to magnify small kindnesses is clear and consistent, driving her choices like placing the button and tracing projections. Interiority is embodied through trembling fingertips and emotional pulses, but some emotional depth feels slightly summarized rather than fully dramatized under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Charged Poise as the button continues to reveal stories, reconfiguring hope with cost legible in Amelia's "broken heart but steadier" resolve. The accumulative lens holds strong, with dust patterns and projections escalating meaningfully, and orientation is clear within the first 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The foster care file room constrains choices by enabling dust patterns to unveil narratives, charging the final image with the button's glow. Sensory details like "dim chamber" and "stale air" are selective and purposeful, filtered through Amelia's archival perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Amelia's agency in presenting the button and tracing silhouettes, tightening the stake of honoring forgotten histories. Cost is visible in her emotional journey from broken-hearted to steadier, though the supervisor's agreement slightly softens the pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unseen histories and small kindnesses emerges organically through the button's projections and dust patterns, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the button as a "beacon," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, such as in "dust settled back into patterns, each swirl a quiet testament." Perception is character-specific, though minor register drift occurs in phrases like "examined unknown," but elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and information density, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting in metaphors like "unfurling like a silent flag" and a slight paraphrase loop in "unfurling" uses, but no artifacts harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of dust patterns revealing stories is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the button's transformation into a beacon showcases originality.</comment>
