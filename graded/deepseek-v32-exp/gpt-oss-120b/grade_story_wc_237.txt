<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to transform scars into healing stories is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final transformation is earned by prior causality, though internal contradictions are more reflective than actively simultaneous in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as scars become luminous runes, a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the quill's constraint shapes tactics, with felt cost in the release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the floating rock and quill constraining choices and charging the final image. Details are selective and purposeful, integrated into action and POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early, escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the accumulative lens, and cost is legible as scars transform. One meaningful tightening occurs when the quill crystallizes under stress.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges organically from images and actions, with subtext in the feather's dissolution. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control. Perception is character-specific, and elision (e.g., held breath) is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, though minor overwriting exists without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing rune magic with personal healing. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes, and the transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
