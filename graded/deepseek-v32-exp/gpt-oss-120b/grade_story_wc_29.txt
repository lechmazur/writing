<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply integrated with her role; her cautious hope is embodied in micro-choices like setting up the transmitter, and her final renunciation of naivety is earned through the cost of vigilance. Interiority is concrete and contradictory, avoiding stock phrasing. The trait "cautiously hopeful" drives key decisions under pressure, scaling to the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in "the weight of all the charts" and the promise of ongoing interference. The Causal lens holds tightly from signal interpretation to community healing, with no orientation debt. The subsonic method acts as a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The radio station setting constrains choices through the transmitter setup and broadcast mechanics, charging the final image of the "lighthouse." Sensory details like "dust‑touched astronomical charts" are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding generic description. Spatial choreography remains clear despite the cosmic scale.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Causal lens, from initial signal plotting to diverting the false alarm, with cost legible in the community's shifted anxiety. The dominant stake of unity vs. chaos tightens through the interference method, foreclosing panic options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of balance through human ingenuity emerges organically from the broadcast's subtext and the final image of the "shared pulse," without moralizing. The ending reweights prior divisions through the conceptual repricing of interference as a bridge, offering a resonant answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Mara's professional focus; the "ethereal grit" tone modulates under pressure without head-hopping. Rhythmic control is evident in lines like "the broadcast’s surface remained a gritty news crawl," and any elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language like "canvas for the celestial signal" is consistent and purposeful, even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion advances character and atmosphere without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic tricksters, subsonic interference, and community unity feels inevitable and fresh, transforming tropes through specific details like the refrigerator hum. Risk-taking in blending myth and technology heightens stakes without gimmickry, supporting the closure.</comment>
