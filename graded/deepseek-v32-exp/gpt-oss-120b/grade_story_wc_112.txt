<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and drives the plot, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; emotions like "mechanically warm" are embodied but somewhat abstract. Her final choice to pull the lever is earned, with cost felt in the temporal shift, yet the absence of deep internal struggle limits depth. Strengths include consistent traits and goal-oriented actions under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as time bends sideways, proven by the experiment, with cost legible in the station's logs and crew reaction. Causal drive holds strong from lever pull to nexus intensification, and orientation is clear early. The structure is tight, with one meaningful tightening that forecloses options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like "frosted clouds" and "bioluminescent vines," constraining choices via the lever's location and charging the final image. Atmosphere of "icy warmth" is consistent and purposeful, filtered through Lira's POV. Spatial choreography is coherent, enhancing tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving time's sideways movement—escalates through Lira's agency in pulling the lever, narrowing options under the causal lens. Cost is legible in the temporal drift and station's response, though stakes remain intellectual rather than visceral. Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of time's nonlinearity emerges through events and images like "sideways glance," offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and implications, such as the flora's awakening acknowledging the shift. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, using poetic diction and rhythm that reflect Lira's focus. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., holographic principles) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift, though dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative but purposeful, with varied syntax and high information density advancing story momentum. Motifs like "icy warmth" are coherent without muddle, and no significant loops or scaffolds obscure closure. Rhythm supports emotional beats, though occasional ornamentation exists.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of xenobiology and temporal drift, transformed through specific details like the glyph-etched lever. Emotional truth in Lira's quiet satisfaction and risk-taking with poetic style heighten stakes. However, it leans on familiar archetypes without full transformation.</comment>
