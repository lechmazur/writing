<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to name nameless fears is clear and drives the story, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation is earned through prior causality, though internal contradiction is subtle rather than stark.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—Lira's ascent—and cost is legible in the stone's echo and her release. The accumulative lens holds, with orientation clear early and no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The observatory and atlas page constrain choices and charge the final image, with vivid sensory details filtered through Lira's POV. Specificity is purposeful and mirrors internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency in naming each fear, tightening the stake of releasing grief under the accumulative lens. Cost is visible in the weight lifted and the aurora's formation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice and naming fears emerges through events and images, not statement, with the ending offering a non-literal answer. Subtext operates in the crystallization and dissolution of fears.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, supporting propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reaper mythology with naming rituals feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
