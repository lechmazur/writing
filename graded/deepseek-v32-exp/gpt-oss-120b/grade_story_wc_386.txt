<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and drives choices, but interiority leans abstract with less embodied emotion; micro-choices under pressure are present, yet final action feels earned but lacks deep contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong; closure lands with Charged Poise as the globe pulses and she sets out, cost felt in the promise; orientation is clear early, and persistent constraint of the globe shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory setting with selective detail; the glacier shrine and melted snow globe constrain choices and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ test for environmental impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens through dream mapping and agency to embed cameos; cost is legible in the effort and promise, driving stakes meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with purity illuminated, avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single PVO is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, with rhythmic control and no head-hopping, though no dialogue is present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative but purposeful, with high information density and clear propulsion; minor overwriting in peaks doesn't harm closure or cause loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost whispering and dream analysis with unique elements; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable.</comment>
