<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to harvest insights from failure is clear and drives her choices, with embodied emotion in micro-choices like uncasing relics and using the flute. Interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing, and her final renunciation to sow seeds of failure is earned by prior causality. However, slight over-reliance on introspection without contradictory impulses in scene prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mara returns with insights, reconfiguring her purpose under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in her promise to listen to failures, and orientation is clear early. The lens holds without ambiguity, though the seam's opening feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with the thunder echo range and canyon hush, constraining choices through the driftwood markers and flute. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, charging the final image of the flute catching light. Environment actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of harvesting insights escalates under the Accumulative lens through Mara's agency—using the flute and entering the world—deepening knowledge. Cost is unmistakable in her return to sow lessons, though escalation lacks multiple tight turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of learning from failure emerges organically through events and images like the flute's silence and woven worlds, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mara's realization, reweighting prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic rhythm and selective attention under pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., world beyond) is taught and paid off at closure, though dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has varied rhythm and high information density without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "avalanchingly quiet" is purposeful, and propulsion is maintained, though minor register drift in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept of weaving worlds and harvesting insights is fresh, synthesized with specific details like the gilded flute and driftwood markers. Risk-taking in quiet, lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
