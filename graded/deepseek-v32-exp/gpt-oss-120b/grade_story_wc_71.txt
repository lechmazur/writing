<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits as a noticer; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as feeling the "weight of silence." The final realization of catalyzing shifts is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the altered perception of the town. Micro-choices under pressure, like placing the shard, reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal chain under an accumulative/textural lens, from seeking understanding to using the shard, leading to a resonant reconfiguration closure. Orientation is anchored early; the closure unit lands with cost in the shared hush and realigned curiosity. The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and the ending reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "salty lullaby" and "amber halos," filtered through POV. The bay and houses pressure choices, and micro-setting elements (shard, displaced objects) constrain actions and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve with the hush's spread.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding and sanctifying the mind escalates through protagonist agency in using the shard, under the accumulative/textural lens. The hush's radiation deepens stakes, narrowing options and changing knowledge with cost legible in the town's pulsed sync. Agency-driven escalation forecloses paths without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence and noticing emerges through events and images, not direct statement; subtext operates in the hush and displaced objects. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the realization that houses feel alive because we hear their hush. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is poetic and consistent, as in "the streetlights daydream." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure. Diction remains within the narrator's lexicon, and psychic distance shifts intentionally with emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in peak beats, like "hushed blaze," slightly muddles clarity without harming closure. No major loops or artifacts; sentence-level propulsion is strong, and figurative language is generally purposeful. Read-aloud ear test passes with natural variation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of the noticer role with the shard of hush concept, transforming tropes through specific, grounded choices. Turns feel earned in hindsight, and the premise offers a non-obvious angle on familiarity. Risk-taking in lyric design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure effect is legible.</comment>
