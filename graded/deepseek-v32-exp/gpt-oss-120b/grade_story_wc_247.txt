<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Arlen's motivation is clear and profound, driving the narrative, but his characterization remains somewhat abstract and symbolic, lacking deep interior contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure. His actions align with his goal, and the joyful sorrow adds complexity, but he feels more like a vehicle for the theme than a fully fleshed-out individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds strong with a clear two-shard structure transitioning to Lira, teaching the pattern of mapping silence early. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the harbor's transformation and Lira's adoption of the method reconfigure meaning with undeniable conceptual cost, though felt emotional price is subtle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The luminous harbor is vividly rendered with selective sensory details that charge the final image and constrain choices, acting as a micro-setting that Arlen and Lira actively use to orchestrate music. Its integration with action and theme is seamless, elevating it beyond mere atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is driven by Arlen's agency in disrupting the harbor's rhythm, tightening the stake of translating silence into music with a legible cost in the "joyful sorrow" and the harbor's response. However, the conflict lacks high-stakes pressure or multiple reversals, fitting the textural mode but limiting intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete images and actions, such as the camera and sign language, offering a resonant, non-literal exploration of beauty from absence without moralizing. Subtext in gestures and the harbor's response deepens the emotional aftereffect, embracing complexity and lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and multi-segmented with clear shifts, maintaining a lyrical, consistent voice that reflects the accumulative lens. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature with poetic diction and rhythm, though dialogue is absent and the focus remains on interiority and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is highly poetic with strong rhythm and information density, avoiding loops or scaffolding artifacts. Figurative language is voice-motivated and coherent, though occasional purple tendencies might slightly blur clarity in peak beats, but not enough to harm closure or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of mapping silence into music through sign language is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in the lyrical structure heightening stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details like the filmless camera and harbor setting anchor originality in character and conflict.</comment>
