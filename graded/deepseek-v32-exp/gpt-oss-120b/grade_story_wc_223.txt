<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her past as a crisis actor, intensifying under pressure to preserve small gestures. Her internal contradiction is shown through feigned vs. felt terror, and micro-choices like walking patterns reveal her values. The final commitment to chronicling small acts is earned with visible cost when she feels the weight on her shoulders.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing where the scroll's revelation reweights the importance of small gestures, with cost legible in Mira's felt weight. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the nomadic penumbra reinforcing the theme.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The whispering gallery constrains choices by amplifying echoes and housing the chessboard, which charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, such as the dust and mirror sheen, integrated into action. The environment directly shapes Mira's tactics and the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Accumulative lens, from walking patterns to uncovering the scroll, narrowing options toward preserving small gestures. Cost is unmistakable when she feels the weight of gestures, and the stake in memory preservation tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the missing pawns and nomadic penumbra, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on memory's value without moralizing. Subtext in gestures and the final image reweights prior material, embracing complexity through Mira's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control under pressure. Perception is character-specific, and elision (e.g., the penumbra's nature) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "luminous absence" is purposeful and clear, and syntax accelerates with scene needs. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements (crisis actor, whispering gallery, missing pawns) feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in poetic style heightening stakes. Transformation of tropes through specific detail and a non-obvious moral calculus on small gestures.</comment>
