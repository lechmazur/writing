<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. However, the lack of contradictory impulses or genuine struggle limits depth, though the final transformation is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change and felt cost (burden transformed to purpose), causal lens holds tightly, and the mainspring barrel acts as a persistent constraint shaping tactics. Orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices; the mainspring barrel and dust patterns function as micro-settings that constrain actions and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering what ceilings hide) is signaled early; escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens, with cost legible in the transformed burden. No coincidental resolutions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images (cracks as frames to truth), with subtext in ghostly whispers; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled, and rhythmic prose heightens pressure without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story with clear propulsion, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and synthesized inevitably; the blend of ghost-seeing tech and circus haunting transforms tropes through specific detail, with risk-taking that coheres without gimmickry.</comment>
