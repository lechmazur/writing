<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her retrocognitive trait, driving her to create a maze that dissolves time boundaries. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as consulting the halo fragment. The final realization of feeling time's texture is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the dissolution of photographs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building through descriptive layers to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where time becomes palpable. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible in the final image of loss and renewal. The structure is coherent, with the garden's completion serving as a charged poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral to the narrative, with the living bridge garden and hyperbolic corridors constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's POV, such as the mist carrying fading photographs. The environment actively shapes the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Mara's quest to feel time's texture, escalating through her agency in building the maze under the Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable when photographs dissolve and the garden quivers with loss and renewal. Agency drives the deepening, with no reliance on coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events, exploring fluidity of time without moralizing. Subtext is rich in the garden's actions and fading photographs. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the maze's completion, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Mara's expertise and emotional state. Voice modulates with pressure, and elision is purposeful, such as the hyperbolic geometry taught early. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent, like "living sine wave." Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative build, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of hedge maze design, hyperbolic geometry, and time perception. Tropes are transformed through specific details, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with emotional specificity.</comment>
