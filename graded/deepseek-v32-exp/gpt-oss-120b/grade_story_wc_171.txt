<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is strong with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as writing the terms with deliberate strokes. Her operatively gentle trait is consistently shown calming hardened generals, and the final renunciation (chieftains laying down swords) is earned by her actions. However, her competence borders on one-dimensional, with minimal internal contradiction, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with cost as chieftains lay down swords, symbolizing peace, and Lira's tear reflects awe. Causal lens holds tightly: her writing the terms leads directly to the pact. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the ebony clipboard acts as a persistent constraint shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the ancient terrace and celestial bodies creating atmosphere that pressures choices—the altar and ritual are central to the resolution. The ebony clipboard and stone circle recur, charging the final image of reconciliation. Sensory details (firelight, jasmine scent) are purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of peace escalates through Lira's agency: writing terms prompts chieftains to bow and lay down swords, with cost legible in the "quiet ache" and foreclosed grudges. Under causal lens, one meaningful tightening (the first chieftain's softening) narrows options toward resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of redemption's price emerges organically through images like swords becoming symbols of pact, offering a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures (chieftains' bowed heads) and the final reconfiguration of the clipboard as a "canvas for silver light."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice—e.g., "words fell like dew"—and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but indirect (chieftains' glances), carrying subtext. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., ritual details) is taught and pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied syntax without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("sky that spun lazily") is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle. Momentum is maintained through concise advances, though minor density in peak beats (e.g., "fragile magnificence") doesn't harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of peace negotiator and ritual feels inevitable, with specific details (ebony clipboard, celestial dance) transforming tropes. Risk-taking in lyric tone heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the final image recharges prior motifs with cost.</comment>
