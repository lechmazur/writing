<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and rooted in trait of reverence; interiority is concrete through embodied perception (e.g., "felt the pulse align"). Micro-choices under pressure, such as placing the arrowhead, reveal values. However, lacks deep internal contradiction or flaws that complicate choices, limiting peak emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (earned stasis) with cost legible in "weathered resolve" and pulse fading. Orientation is clear within 120 words; persistent constraint of echoes shapes tactics. Closure lands on-page with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory (e.g., "towers of bone," "echoes"), constraining choices through the canyon's resonance and arrowhead use. Environment charges the final image of the invisible map. Micro-setting (arrowhead) actively pressures navigation decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, escalation via density increase (bird patterns, arrowhead resonance) reweights stakes; agency drives tightening through appraisal and alignment. Cost is felt in "weathered resolve" and foreclosed paths. One meaningful deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of stillness and continuity emerges organically from particulars (pulse, birds, dust); ending offers non-literal answer through the "invisible map" and resolved tension. No moralizing; subtext operates in echoes and images, inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, modulating with pressure (e.g., "each wingbeat a line of code"). No head-hopping; purposeful compression (e.g., "lattice of wind") is taught and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control; no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated (e.g., "birds' wings cutting like knives"). Sentence propulsion varies naturally with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of navigation through resonance and stillness feels inevitable; concept transforms familiar tropes via specific lived detail (arrowhead, bone towers). Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
