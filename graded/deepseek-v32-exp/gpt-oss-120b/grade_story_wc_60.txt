<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's luminous skepticism is consistently embodied and drives her micro-choices, with a credible arc from doubt to belief earned through patient defiance. Her internal conflict between curiosity and skepticism acts simultaneously in scene, notably when she "inhaled the hush" to unstick the box. The final choice to guard memories forecloses her skeptic path with visible cost, scaling to the length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from geese's pause to box's release, with closure as a decisive change (memories liberated, city renewed) and felt cost in Mara's transformed burden. Orientation is anchored within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of sidereal patience shapes tactics. The final image of constellations charges the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the finale, as the forgotten fountains dictate Mara's path and the empty basin's ripple enables the unstick. Sensory details like "petrichor and distant incense" are selective and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography remains clear through alleyways to the plaza.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of memory liberation escalates under causal lens via Mara's agency, from tracing symbols to the final unstick, narrowing options. Cost is legible when the box "shivered" and memories form "new constellations of hope." No coincidence; pressure coheres to the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of skepticism yielding to belief emerges through particulars like the stained glass box refracting "kaleidoscopic prayers," without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in Mara becoming a "keeper of light." Subtext operates in gestures like the city exhaling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, as Mara's "realistically imaginative" mind filters symbols and silence. Lyrical compression is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping; voice modulates with pressure in peaks like the unstick.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing multiple jobs (e.g., "cracked cobblestones whispering of ages lost"). No loops or scaffold; figurative language like "fireflies" bearing stories is purposeful. Clarity persists in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of skeptic archetype with mythic elements feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like sidereal patience and geese as temporal keys. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh inflection in the constellation mirroring geese.</comment>
