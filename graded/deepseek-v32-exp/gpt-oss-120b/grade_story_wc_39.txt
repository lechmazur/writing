<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The poet's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure driving his mission. His wistful gaze and redemption arc are earned through causality, with visible cost in shoulders lifting. However, contradictory impulses are subtle, limiting the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the poet's role solidifies, cost legible in "weight of centuries lift." Accumulative/textural lens holds, orientation clear early, and constraints shape the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory detail; the loft and jars constrain choices and charge the final image. Environment actively pressures tactics, such as capturing sounds, elevating beyond description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens, with cost in shared redemption. Dominant stake of translation tightens through sound captures, but one minor slip in pacing slightly limits peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images and actions, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with redemption gleaned from dust. Subtext in jars and music box avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; poetic voice modulates under pressure, and elision (e.g., sound captures) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "luminous ribbons") slightly reduces propulsion, but clarity remains.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sound-capturing and redemption feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details transform familiar tropes through character-driven choices.</comment>
