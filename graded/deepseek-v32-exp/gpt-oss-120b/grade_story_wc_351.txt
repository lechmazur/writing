<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aria's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her actions; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, though some phrases like "chaotically precise" risk abstraction. Her final choice to revive dreams is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the tremor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Aria achieves her goal and prepares for future dreams, with cost legible in the tremor and risk of fracture. Causal lens holds tightly from inciting incident to resolution, and orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral to the plot, with sensory details (moonlight, basalt) filtering through Aria's POV. The canyon constrains choices by supplying the memory lattice and charges the final image through the projected tableaux.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Aria's agency under the causal lens, as her modification of the mirror narrows options and invites risk (tremor), with cost visible in the fragile bridge and her steadfast response. Dominant stake in reviving dreams tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of abandoned dreams emerges organically through images and actions, avoiding moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the mirrored tableaux, reweighting prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that blends logic and wonder; voice remains coherent under pressure, and elision (e.g., synaptic plasticity) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied syntax and clear propulsion; minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "chaotically precise" repetition) does not obscure closure, and there are no significant loops or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes engineering and memory in a fresh, non-obvious way; risk-taking in treating mineral veins as neural tissue heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable from established pattern.</comment>
