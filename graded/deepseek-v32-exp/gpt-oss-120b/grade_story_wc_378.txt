<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vira's motivation to resolve inner static is clear and drives key choices, such as using the box and activating the burn. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, like "inner static humming through her circuits," and micro-choices under pressure reveal her values. However, the resolution feels slightly tidy, with minimal contradictory impulses acting in scene, though the final renunciation of vigilance is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal chain under a Hybrid lens, with magnetic shift triggering events that escalate to closure. Orientation is clear early, and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in "the static dissolve, replaced by a fragmented wholeness." The persistent constraint of the magnetic field shapes tactics, but minor quick resolution prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the glass dome and organic box constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "heat throbbed" and "wood grain breathing" are purposeful and filtered through Vira's POV. The desert rose farm acts as micro-setting, altering tactics during the controlled burn, but lacks deeper occupational integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resolving inner static escalates under the Hybrid lens through Vira's agency, from containing chaos to executing the burn. Cost is legible in the dissolution of static and the foreclosed path of perpetual vigilance. One meaningful tightening occurs, but the escalation relies slightly on convenience in the box's function.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of transformation from fear to calm emerges through events and images, such as the box becoming a "seed of calm," without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the roses as "keepers of the past," but occasional near-moralizing like "testament to hope" slightly reduces ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, such as "sensors tasting the faint scent of ozone." Voice is consistently poetic, and elision is taught, but some ornate phrasing like "fragmented wholeness" risks slight register drift under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with sentences advancing multiple elements, like "the box inhaled, its bark tightening." No significant loops or artifacts obscure clarity, and figurative language is coherent, though minor abstraction in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing android nostalgia with organic elements, transforming tropes through specific details like the breathing box. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in hybrid tone heightens stakes without gimmickry, but close echoes of common sci-fi motifs limit uniqueness.</comment>
