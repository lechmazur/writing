<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., aligning the wing, breathing the hush). However, internal contradiction or conflicting impulses are not dramatized in scene, limiting depth. The final choice feels earned but lacks the complexity of simultaneous contradictory actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the terrestrial and cosmic merge, with cost legible in the brook's stillness and fireflies dimming. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, building through sensory density. Orientation is clear early, and the wing's resonance acts as a persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposeful, with the brook and wing constraining choice (e.g., wing aligned with water's edge). The nocturnal atmosphere charges the final image, and micro-setting elements like the stone and wing are integrated into action, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with the ritual's progression (chanting, wing vibrating) tightening stakes. Cost is unmistakable in the achieved hush and merging, foreclosing the prophecy's threat. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through images of silence and connection, with the ending offering a non-literal answer to hushing prophecy. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, avoiding moralizing. The final image reweights prior material without stated thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects the summoner's focus. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision (e.g., prophecy details) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds obscuring clarity. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing momentum without muddle. Read-aloud test passes with smooth propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the specific synthesis of elements (e.g., origami wing as cosmic conduit), transforming tropes through grounded detail. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable from established pattern.</comment>
