<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion (e.g., "cold stone cool his pulse"). Interiority is concrete, and the final renunciation is earned by prior causality, though some abstraction slightly limits depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with felt cost (he "sank to the cold floor"), and the accumulative lens holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the resonant reconfiguration (freedom) is legible with cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the aurora-lit archway constraining choices (e.g., tracing stars on marble) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with each traced star increasing stakes and cost (fatigue, surge of poems). One meaningful tightening occurs, though the climax could be slightly more intense.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions, not statement, with subtext in "unspoken words" and stardust. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature (e.g., "remembered stardust"). Rhythm and diction control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing momentum without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of astronomical and poetic elements feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style that heightens stakes. Specific details transform tropes through character and setting.</comment>
