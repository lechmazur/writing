<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to harness the ephemeral is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her to sacrifice the distress beacon. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion like "unsnarl the tight coil of panic," and her final choice to trust the temple is earned by prior causality. However, minor stock phrasing ("heart beat in rhythm with the temple's echo") slightly reduces distinctness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Mara lets the beacon fade, a decisive change under the causal lens that reconfigures her purpose. The temple's demand shapes tactics, and orientation is clear early. No causality breaks; the ending image of sharing the perfume charges the resolution with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific ("violet gloom," "basalt column") and constrains choices, such as the vial placement altering the temple's response. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Mara's urgency, though occasional over-reliance on visual description slightly limits full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (battery waning, vial's power) escalates through Mara's agency, culminating in her choice to forfeit the beacon—a tightening that narrows options with visible cost. Pressure coheres under the causal lens, and the trade-off charges the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of harnessing the ephemeral emerges through action and image, not statement, with subtext in the temple's price and Mara's promise. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though minor thematic echoes ("lonesome splendor") lean toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic texture ("gathered hush like a veil of soft fog"). However, slight register drift in peak beats ("unsnarl the tight coil of panic") and repetitive syntactic patterns reduce rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with vivid imagery, but template cadence runs (e.g., repeated "gathered hush") and minor synonym churn ("lonesome splendor" echoed) create slight artifacts. No loops obscure closure, and information density remains high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes mystical and emotional elements freshly, with the vial's power transforming tropes through specific stakes. Risk-taking in the temple's sentient demand heightens coherence, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
