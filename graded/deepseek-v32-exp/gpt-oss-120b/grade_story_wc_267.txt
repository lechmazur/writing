<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bellhop's symbolic presence and the guests' clear motivation to understand safety's cost are strengths, but limited interiority and embodied emotion for the bellhop reduce depth; his actions feel archetypal rather than fully earned through contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong; closure is a charged poise with the bolt and discoloration shift reconfiguring safety's cost, anchored by early orientation and persistent silence constraint; cost is legible in the guests' acceptance of silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (e.g., "bruised sapphire walls," "frost-lined tiles") charge the final image; the fortress and discoloration constrain choices and deepen atmosphere, meeting the 9+ test by shaping the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes on safety cost escalate through the bellhop's agency (placing the bolt) and the discoloration's shift under accumulative lens; cost is felt in the trade-off for silence, though escalation is subtle rather than sharply causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of safety's cost emerges organically through images and silence without moralizing; the final reconfiguration (bolt as monument) offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with a distinct, poetic perceptual signature; voice modulates with pressure (e.g., "frostbitten hope"), and elision (e.g., silence) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or scaffolds, and figurative language ("seraphically mundane") serves purpose without muddle; propulsion remains clear even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elements (fortress, silence, regeneration) feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative design and emotional specificity avoids templates, with the closure image heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
