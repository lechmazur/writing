<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, driving higher-stakes choices. Interiority is poetic but could benefit from more embodied contradiction under pressure. The final endurance is earned, with visible cost in breaking old precedents, though emotional depth is somewhat serene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (breaking guild precedents) under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The transformation of the labyrinth is legible and charged.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the labyrinth constraining choices and charging the final image. Details like "red canyon walls" and "orchid solace" are integrated into action and tone, supporting theme without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the weaver's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in the breaking of precedents. Dominant stake (ruin to reverence) tightens through her actions, though conflict lacks high drama.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, offering a non-literal answer to renewal without moralizing. Subtext in motifs like "broken precedents" and "orchid solace" resists simplicity, inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and rhythmic control. Perceptual signature is consistent, though some phrases risk over-decoration. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with good rhythm and density, but minor overwriting (e.g., repeated "hauntingly optimistic") and template cadence in places slightly dull momentum. No major artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality is high with a fresh synthesis of weaver and labyrinth tropes, transformed through specific details and risk-taking in accumulative design. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, supporting stakes.</comment>
