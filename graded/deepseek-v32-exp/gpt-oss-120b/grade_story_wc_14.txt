<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, driving the stationer's actions, but lacks deep internal contradiction or embodied conflict in scene; final realization is earned but without palpable cost on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing as the stationer understands invented histories as bridges, with cost legible in the final image; Accumulative lens holds throughout with clear orientation early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with selective sensory details integrated into action; bonsai forests and lamp shape tactics and resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake of collecting time textures escalates through agency under Accumulative lens, with cost felt in closure; one meaningful deepening reweights options without external conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images and events without moralizing; ending offers resonant non-literal answer on invented histories as bridges, with earned wisdom from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice remains coherent under pressure, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high density and propulsion with vivid imagery, but minor overwriting in peaks (e.g., "refract that hum, turning vibration into a spectrum") slightly muddles clarity without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes invented histories and refracting time with specificity and risk-taking; feels inevitable in hindsight and heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
