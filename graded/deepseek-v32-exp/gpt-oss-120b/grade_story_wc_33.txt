<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Milo's motivation is clear and rooted in his role, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as feeling the storm's "electric sigh." The final choice to use the storm and deliver the message is earned, though some abstract phrasing slightly dampens interior contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the drones acknowledge the truce, with cost legible when the storm erupts and washes away grudges. The accumulative/textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early with who, where, and when anchored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobalt arcade and thunderstorm bottle constrain choices and charge the final image, with vivid sensory details like "neon hummed" and "cracked floor tiles." Setting is integrated into action, reflecting Milo's priorities and enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Milo's agency under the accumulative lens, as he uses the storm to blind the drone and deliver the truce message, with cost visible in the storm's eruption and the "brittle hush." Stakes are clear and tighten meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of healing broken promises through linking absences emerges organically from events and imagery, such as the storm and drones, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "quiet thunder" and crossed paths.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, reflected in rhythmic control and perceptual signature, like "coat flapping like a banner of surrender." No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is coherent and supports pressure, though minor purple tendencies exist in peaks like "thunderstorm in a bottle."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, transforming tropes through grounded details like the mailman role and storm bottle. Synthesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric style that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
