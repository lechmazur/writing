<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marin's motivation is clear and rooted in her deafness, with embodied emotions like "eroding the frost of her inner apathy." Her agency drives the plot, and the final change is earned through on-page actions, with visible cost in the dissolution of numbness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, with cost legible in "emotional numbness dissolve like frost under a sunrise." Causality is tight, from using the needle to the transformation, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cavern setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices (e.g., the turntable and filament of hush) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marin's agency under the accumulative lens, with stakes in defeating numbness tightening through the use of backward songs. Cost is felt in the emotional thawing, and the climax confronts silence head-on.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images like the filament of hush and backward songs, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to emotional healing. Subtext is rich, avoiding moralizing, and the ending reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with poetic diction and rhythmic control. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, and the perceptual signature reflects Marin's unique perspective as a deaf music teacher.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical, with varied syntax and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and enhances clarity, and momentum is maintained through strategic telling and concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The concept is highly original, synthesizing deafness, backward music, and emotional healing in a non-obvious way. Risk-taking in structure and imagery pays off, feeling inevitable in hindsight and heightening stakes.</comment>
