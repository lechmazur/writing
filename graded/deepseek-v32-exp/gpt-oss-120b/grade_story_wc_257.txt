<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with concrete interiority and embodied emotions. Micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing the stencil on the rose, reveal values and earn the final endurance. Slight stock phrasing in emotional descriptions prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong; closure lands with resonant reconfiguration as she becomes "keeper of light," cost legible in the rose's revival and her grateful tears. Orientation is clear within the first 120 words, and no causality breaks undermine the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is integral and vivid, with the observatory, maps, and origami constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the protagonist's bias, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake—overcoming grief—escalates through protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with cost felt in the rose's transformation and her renewed purpose. One meaningful tightening occurs when she traces the stencil, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of rebirth through intention emerges coherently from events and images like the curtains of intention, with subtext in gestures and implication. No moralizing; earned through particulars such as the rose's glow and the origami cranes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., "genuinely artificial") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift, though lyrical density may border on overwriting in peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm, but minor artifacts include repetitive phrases like "curtains of intention" and "genuinely artificial," causing slight momentum drag without obscuring closure. Information density is high, and sentences advance story purposefully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mourning jewelry, observatory, and origami cranes feels organic and transformative, with risk-taking in accumulative style. The core premise offers a fresh angle on renewal, and the ending reconfigures prior material with inevitability.</comment>
