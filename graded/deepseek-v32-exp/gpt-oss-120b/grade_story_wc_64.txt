<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The gardener's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with a meaningful change in understanding. However, interiority lacks deep internal conflict or embodied contradiction, relying on abstract emotions rather than concrete impulses under pressure. The final insight is earned but feels more conceptual than dramatized with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a conceptual repricing (the circle of intentions) that reweights prior material with felt cost under an accumulative/textural lens. The structure is coherent in a single scene, and orientation is clear early. The cobalt silo and case act as persistent constraints that shape the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the cobalt silo and gravestones creating a charged atmosphere that constrains choice and mirrors internal states. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, though some descriptions verge on purple prose without harming clarity. The silo's pulse at closure reinforces the thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes around discovering intentions escalate through the gardener's agency in decoding the tapestry, narrowing options under an accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the final image of the circle, though conflict is contemplative rather than high-tension. One meaningful tightening occurs when the map is integrated into the case.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tapestry and echoes, offering a non-literal answer (the circle) that reweights memory and intention without moralizing. Subtext is rich in objects and silence, but the epiphany leans slightly abstract. The ending resonates with complexity but avoids tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, rhythmic voice that reflects the gardener's perceptual bias. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and taught. Diction remains consistent under pressure, though some register elevation occurs without breaking voice cohesion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid, with varied rhythm and strong information density, but figurative language stacks in peaks (e.g., "velveteen gloom" repeated) without major artifacts. Momentum is maintained, and closure clarity is unharmed, though minor overwriting nudges down the score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes cemetery ritual with metaphysical inquiry in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming tropes through specific details like the sovereign case and tapestry. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
