<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in grief transformation, with embodied emotion in "luminous torment." Interiority is concrete through actions like polishing dreams, but minor therapy-speak ("fold his own grief into origami cranes") slightly reduces authenticity. The final choice to release cranes is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the burning memory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the basilica ascending while descending, mirroring the heart's paradox. The accumulative/textural lens holds, cost is legible in "luminous torment," and orientation is clear by ~120 words. No causality breaks; the shadow detachment tightens pressure meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with floating island tea garden and glass basilica, constraining choices (e.g., shadow detaches at noon). Sensory details (aroma of jasmine, light rippling) are purposeful and POV-filtered. The environment charges the final image of ascending/descending, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transforming grief) escalates under accumulative lens through dream polishing and crane release. Agency drives escalation, with cost visible in "each glow burns with the memory of loss." One meaningful tightening occurs as the shadow detachment forces the recording moment, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grief transformed into hope emerges through images (paradox of ascending/descending) without direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in the "paradoxical peace," reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures like folding cranes, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature (e.g., "coaxing fireflies into cages of crystal"). Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and elision (e.g., shadow detachment) is taught and pays off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language serving the accumulative drive. Minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "luminous torment" repetition) but no coherence breaks or loops. Closure image remains clear, and propulsion is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (dream recording, floating island, origami cranes) feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in paradoxical imagery heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passed; emotional specificity avoids templates, and closure reconfigures familiar tropes.</comment>
