<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Poet's motivation is vividly embodied with internal conflict ("shyly unstoppable") driving accumulative transformation; micro-choices like pressing the postcard reveal character under pressure, though some passivity in observation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with coherent pattern taught early; closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the blossom armistice, with cost legible in the transformation of pain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is richly specific and actively constrains choices (shell as garden, postcard as seed); sensory details like "reef-shadow joy" charge the final image with purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative density driven by poet's agency (singing lullabies, using postcard); cost is unmistakable in the photosynthesis of pain into beauty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through imagery (coral, nebulae) without moralizing; closure offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the child continuing the verse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical POV is stable and distinct with perceptual signature ("off-key wind"); rhythmic control under pressure enhances accumulative texture without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or figurative muddle, though dense metaphors cohere and propel closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of poetic transformation feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative, century-spanning structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
