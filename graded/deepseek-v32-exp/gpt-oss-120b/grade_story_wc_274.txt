<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren's bravely conflicted motivation is clear and drives her choice to plant the letter, with embodied emotion like "the brave conflict within her burned brighter." Interiority is concrete, and her micro-choice under pressure reveals values, though some internal conflict is summarized rather than fully dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the letter's dissemination sparks rebellion, cost is legible in Maren risking "frozen preservation," and the causal lens holds strong from her action to the ripple effect. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with "echoing library under snow" and "cracked marble column" constraining Maren's choice to use the conduit and charging the final image of the library as a "lighthouse." Sensory details are integrated and reflect POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maren's agency under the causal lens, as her planting the letter narrows options and raises the cost of scandal, with visible price in her risk. Stakes of liberation vs. peace are signaled early and tighten meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of dissent and truth emerges through events and images like "snowflakes settle on the open pages," offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, though complexity is somewhat straightforward.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic rhythm, e.g., "like a shiver traveling down a frozen spine," and perceptual signature is consistent. No head-hopping or dialogue issues, but some figurative density may slight pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Minor overwriting in peaks like "the quiet became dizzying" causes slight figurative muddle, but clarity and propulsion remain strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of cryogenic archives and contraband truth, transformed through specific details and Maren's conflict. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
