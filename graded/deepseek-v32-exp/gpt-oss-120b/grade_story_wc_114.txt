<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mirela's motivation is clear and rooted in her post-fever state, with concrete interiority like "auroral sorrow." Her micro-choices, such as smudging the illustration, reveal character under pressure, and the final resolution is earned through prior causality. The change from sorrow to resolve feels authentic and scaled to the length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative/textural lens, closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost in Mirela's internal shift. The orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the final image reweighting prior material. The cost is legible in the weight lifting from her chest.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mountain weather station constrains choices, such as using the console and illustration, and charges the final image with the wind and aurora. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, like the rusted panels and humming console, filtered through Mirela's POV. The setting evolves consistently with the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mirela's agency under the accumulative lens, such as smudging the illustration and adjusting the barometer, which deepens the stake of finding truth. The cost is legible in her emotional shift and the trembling needle. One meaningful tightening occurs, foreclosing internal conflict with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, like the smudged illustration and swaying certainties, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to truth and sorrow, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures and implications, such as the lie tasting of pine sap.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in the poetic, rhythmic prose. Voice modulates with pressure, such as the mournful hiss of the heater, and any elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; the narrative stance remains coherent and effective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting occurs, like repeated "auroral sorrow," but no major artifacts obscure clarity. Figurative language is generally coherent and supports the accumulative design without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of a fault-tolerant oracle and botanical illustration as data offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Tropes are transformed through specific details, and the emotional truth feels authentic. Risk-taking in style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
