<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Selene's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and a credible transformation where her curse becomes a compass. The final choice is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her altered perception. However, minor diagnostic label-speak in "precognitively cursed" slightly reduces immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative lens, as Selene's realization reweights the universe's patterns with felt cost. The drive lens holds consistently, and orientation is anchored early. The persistent constraint of her curse shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the tidal bluff and aurora constraining choices and charging the final image through the painted rocks' sequence. Sensory details are purposefully woven into action, and micro-setting elements like the star dust alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Selene's agency under the accumulative lens, with a meaningful tightening as the star dust ignites and reconfigures her curse. Cost is legible in the transformation, and stakes are deeply felt through her actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in the promise and patterns, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Selene's realization and the map left behind.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that reflects Selene's worldview. Prose rhythm and diction are controlled under pressure, and any elision is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm, but minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "violet ribbons of aurora" and "powdered iron" metaphors) slightly reduces clarity. No major loops or scaffolds, and closure remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightening stakes. Specific details like the eel herder and mathematical sequences transform tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
