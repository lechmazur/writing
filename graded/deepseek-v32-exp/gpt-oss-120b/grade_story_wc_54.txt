<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority shown through technical recall and micro-choices like rerouting power. However, lacks internal conflict or flaws that complicate choices, making the arc straightforward without contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the terminal's revival and her renewed purpose, cost legible in the effort and transformation. Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages from sextant use to power rerouting. Orientation is immediate, and persistent constraints like the sextant shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like dust and humming panels integrated into action. The spaceport's structure and sextant constrain choices and charge the final image of illuminated gates, though sensory range could be broader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes of resurrecting hope escalate through protagonist's agency under causal lens, from observation to rerouting flows, with cost in transformed joy. One meaningful tightening occurs as power surge alters options, but external conflict is minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of engineering hope emerges organically from events like redirected flows and sextant repurposing, with subtext in images. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though some abstractions linger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature blending technical and poetic diction. Voice remains coherent under pressure, and purposeful elision in concepts like "maze of intentions" is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid with strong rhythm, but slight overwriting in metaphors like "carnival lights" and repetitive "maze of intentions" phrases creates minor artifacts without harming closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of engineering and lyricism feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details like sextant as ethical compass. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
