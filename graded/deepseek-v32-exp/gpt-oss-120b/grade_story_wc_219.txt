<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arin's motivation is clear and consistent, driving his choices like spreading the amber and offering it as a token. His interiority is concrete through embodied actions, such as tracing footprints and watching the glow, with micro-choices under pressure. The final realization that homecoming is a dialogue feels earned by prior causality, though the emotional cost is slightly abstract, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the plot builds through sensory patterns to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Arin understands homecoming as a dialogue. Orientation is early with the tower and footprints, and the convergence of sound, light, and chemistry lands with cost in the shared reaction and new rhythm. The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and closure is legible with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rainwashed tower and overgrown sculptures pressure choices by guiding Arin's path, while the fly amber constrains his actions and charges the final image with its glow. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, filtered through Arin's POV, with the setting evolving consistently to support the climax. The environment actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding homecoming escalates under the accumulative lens through the convergence of amber glow and alien vibration, driven by Arin's agency in spreading the amber and offering it. Cost is legible in the shared reaction and reconfigured meaning, though the escalation is more textural than causal, with one meaningful deepening sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of homecoming as dialogue emerges organically from events like the amber's glow matching the alien rhythm, without direct statement. Subtext operates in gestures such as Arin's offering, and the ending provides a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of shared patterns. Thematic complexity avoids moralizing and lingers with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—Arin's skeptical, curious voice filters descriptions like "bronze quiet resonance." Prose rhythm modulates with pressure, and purposeful compression (e.g., the convergence) is taught and legible. No head-hopping or register drift, though dialogue is minimal and functional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density, advancing story through concrete images. Rhythm varies naturally, but slight overwriting occurs in phrases like "bronze quiet resonance" and "chemical fingerprint," causing minor figurative muddle without harming closure. No loops or scaffolds; momentum remains strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh synthesis of first contact with chemistry and homecoming, transforming tropes through specific details like fly amber and artificial pilgrimage. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable from prior particulars. Originality is integral to the narrative arc.</comment>
