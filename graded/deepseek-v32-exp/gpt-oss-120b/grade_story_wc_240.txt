<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in traits, with embodied interiority. However, internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and the final choice, while earned, doesn't showcase deep struggle under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (storm averted, new understanding), under a causal lens that holds tightly. Orientation is immediate, and causality drives each beat to a satisfying end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and POV-filtered, with the bioluminescent farm charging the final image. However, it doesn't strongly constrain choices, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through the storm threat, driven by protagonist agency. Cost is legible in the averted disaster, but escalation is somewhat linear under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of "letting go" emerges organically through events and imagery, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext is rich, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with poetic reflection and perceptual signature. Dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic, with high information density and no artifacts. Figurative language is coherent, and closure is undulled by line-level issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and synthesizes elements uniquely, with emotional specificity. Risk-taking in tone and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
