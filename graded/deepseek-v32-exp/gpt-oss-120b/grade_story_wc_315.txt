<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing hierarchy of values. However, internal contradiction is minimal, and the final endurance feels earned but lacks deep conflicting impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with felt cost when the burden lifts and radio crackles. Orientation is clear early, and lens holds without ambiguity, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image, with selective sensory detail woven through action. The nocturnal arbor and parachute buckle function as micro-setting that alters tactics and reinforces theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative/Textural lens through density increase in revision process, with agency driving stakes and cost legible when burden lifts. One meaningful tightening forecloses options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the buckle and silence, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to trust and burden without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and image, inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with poetic, consistent POV and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice reflects character's mind, and elision (e.g., radio static) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with varied syntax and no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, though slightly dense in peaks, but propulsion remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of celestial forest and watcher's burden, with risk-taking in lyric style that heightens stakes. Transformation of tropes through specific details feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
