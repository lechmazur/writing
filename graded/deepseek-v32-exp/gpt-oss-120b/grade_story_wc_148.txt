<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The boy's motivation is clear and rooted in his past, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure; his final renunciation of his own warning for a guide is earned by the lattice's guidance and prior causality, with visible cost in the cold salt and rising bodies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the boy finds the map and shifts to guiding others, with cost legible in the cold salt searing his feet and the bodies rising; causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages driven by the lattice's pulses.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices, such as the narrow door and jagged reef constraining movement; the lattice as a micro-setting object charges the final image by resonating and guiding the boy's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the boy's agency under the causal lens, from the lattice pulsing to finding the map and facing the reef; cost is unmistakable in the physical discomfort and emotional resolution, though stakes remain slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of redemption through story emerges organically from the boy's arc and the lattice's symbolism; the ending reweights prior material without moralizing, offering a resonant answer in the hush and copperlight repose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic prose and rhythmic control; elision like the repeated "scuffs on a narrow door" is taught and pays off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative but purposeful, with varied rhythm and advance; some repetition of phrases like "copperlight repose" and "scuffs on a narrow door" creates minor artifacts without harming closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and transformative, blending the cry wolf trope with magical realism in a lighthouse prison; specific synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking in style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
