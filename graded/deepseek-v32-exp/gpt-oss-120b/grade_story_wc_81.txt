<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, but lacks significant internal conflict or flaws, slightly reducing depth. Her final resolution is earned through causality, with cost felt in the revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (the vault discovery and city's rebirth) under a causal lens, cost is legible in the "reclaimed stillness" and tangible actions. Orientation is clear early, and structure is coherent with meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the library and ink stamp constraining choices and charging the final image. POV-filtered details integrate into action, enhancing atmosphere and stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (tracing origins) escalates through Mara's agency under the causal lens, with cost legible in the revelation and its impact. One meaningful tightening (vault discovery) forecloses options and reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth and knowledge emerges through events and images (e.g., ink stamp, reclaimed stillness), with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext operates in implication without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (logical, precise). Voice remains coherent under pressure, and prose reflects Mara's character without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density, varied rhythm, and clear propulsion without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is purposeful, and sentence-level craft supports momentum and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of sunken city lore and logical indexing, with specific details transforming tropes. Risk-taking in structure and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
