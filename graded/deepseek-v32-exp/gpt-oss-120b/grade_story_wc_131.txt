<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and rooted in her kindly methodical nature, driving her choices under pressure. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as feeling the sense memory surge. The final visibility is earned through prior causality, but internal conflict is somewhat subdued, lacking contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Maren becomes visible, with cost legible in the "quiet grief" acknowledged. The accumulative/textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early. One persistent constraint—the outage—shapes tactics, but causality is slightly softened by poetic leaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the library constraining choices and charging the final image through sensory details like "sapphire hush" and "cool breath of dust." Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maren's agency under the accumulative lens, with stakes tightening through her caching actions. Cost is legible in the "collective yearning" and her role as conduit. One meaningful deepening changes knowledge, but pressure relies more on texture than causal turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of visibility and grief emerges through particulars like the tape reel and library whispers, offering a resonant, non-literal answer at closure. Subtext operates in implication, but occasional near-moralizing ("allowing the quiet grief... surface") slightly reduces complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a lyrical perceptual signature, filtering setting through Maren's priorities. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., "phantom patrons") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with sentences advancing multiple elements. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("sapphire hush" repeated) but no artifacts obscuring closure. Clarity and momentum are maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of memory, visibility, and library lore, with specific details feeling inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transforms familiar tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
