<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Selin's motivation is clear and consistent, driving key choices like discarding assumptions and tuning the transmitter. Interiority is concrete through embodied perception, but lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle, limiting depth. The final choice is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the city's rebirth, though her competence borders on over-tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early with who, where, and when anchored. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the city's rebirth reweights meaning with felt cost. The lunar perigee and shard act as persistent constraints, and causality holds without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "rusted towers hung like a broken harp" filtering through Selin's POV. The tower and shard constrain choices and charge the final image, integrating environment into action and theme without ornamental excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of survival/rebirth escalates through Selin's agency in tuning the transmitter, under the Accumulative lens. The cost is legible in the city's awakening and hidden pathways revealed, foreclosing decay with a meaningful tightening that drives the narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of beginnings in endings emerges organically from events like the shard rewriting syntax, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "Genesis in Echo" image, reweighting prior material with complexity and avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending poetic and practical tones. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., discarding assumptions) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffolds; figurative language like "comet’s tail" is coherent and purposeful. Clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes celestial interpretation and decayed city with freshness, transforming tropes through specific details like the quantum coil. Risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
