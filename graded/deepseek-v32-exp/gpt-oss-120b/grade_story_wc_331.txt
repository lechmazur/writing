<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to reawaken analog memories is clear and consistent, driving her actions like scarf adjustments and algorithm whispers. However, interiority leans abstract with terms like "hyperbolic transformations," lacking concrete embodiment or internal conflict in scene. Micro-choices reveal values, but final endurance feels more accumulative than causally earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (story projection) under an accumulative/textural lens, cost legible in the transient reawakening and need for continual care. Orientation is clear by ~120 words (Mara, library, midnight). Lens holds without ambiguity, and the ending reweights meaning without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory (ozone, ink, pulsed spines) and integral, constraining choices via library curvature and scarf use. The scarf and library recur to charge the final image, meeting the 9+ test by altering tactics and closure. Spatial choreography is coherent despite poetic density.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawakening memories) escalates through Mara's agency under accumulative lens, with tightening via scarf adjustments and algorithm leading to projection. Cost is visible in the transient outcome and continual care required. One meaningful deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory and story emerges through particulars like the scarf's resonance and library's geometry, avoiding moralizing. Ending offers a non-literal answer with the projected story, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in imagery and implication, though some abstraction lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, perceptual signature in Mara's noticing of "equations in rhyme" and "hyperbolic field." Rhythmic control under pressure, e.g., "air thickened with the scent of ozone and ink." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with varied syntax and rhythm accelerating toward closure. Figurative language serves atmosphere without muddling peak beats. Minor overwriting risk in stacked images, but no loops or scaffolds harm causality or clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of scientific poetry, hyperbolic geometry, and analog memories feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in blending genres heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity in details like the scarf's emerald hue and Möbius strip transformation avoids template plots.</comment>
