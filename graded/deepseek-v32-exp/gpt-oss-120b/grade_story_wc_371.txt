<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, but lacks strong internal contradiction or impulsive actions in scene, limiting peak impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost (offering bread to empty chair), and the accumulative/textural lens holds strong; orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the tea house and garden constraining choices and charging the final image; details are purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (finding sacred in ordinary) escalate through agency under accumulative lens, with cost legible in sharing bread; one meaningful deepening, but no live option foreclosed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions, with subtext in gestures like the empty chair; ending offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with lyrical perceptual signature; no head-hopping, and elision (e.g., "uncloak") is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and dense, with varied syntax and no major artifacts; minor overwriting in peaks (e.g., "tenuous absolution" repetition) but clarity intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar tropes through specific details; risk-taking in quiet narrative heightens stakes, but concept isn't fully transformative.</comment>
