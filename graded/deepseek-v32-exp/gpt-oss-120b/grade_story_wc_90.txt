<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Nara's pacifism and emotional state are consistently embodied, with her happiness affecting gravity enabling key actions. However, the characterization lacks deep internal contradiction or flawed irrationality, keeping it from the highest band. The final choice to step through the dimension is earned by prior causality, but the emotional progression is somewhat tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with Nara entering the new dimension, a Resonant Reconfiguration under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the "weight of sorrows" and the ship's sigh. The lens holds throughout, and orientation is clear early with the recycled hull and solitary figure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship constrains Nara's actions and charges the final image as it drifts empty. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like "patched panels humming" and "cold pressure on her back," filtered through her POV to mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Nara's agency under the accumulative lens, with her emotional shifts affecting gravity to advance the stitching. The cost is visible in the "weight of sorrows" and the foreclosed option of staying. Stakes are abstract but deepened through specific actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transforming grief into hope emerges organically through images like Kwan Yin's tear and the luminous garden, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the sealed seam and newborn light, reweighting prior sorrow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, using rhythmic control and perceptual signature like "ghostly resolve" and "mournful fireflies." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure. Diction remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "time slipped like dust on glass." Momentum is maintained through concise, image-driven sentences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of pacifism, space drift, and shadow work feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the lyrical style. Specific details like gravitational lightness and Kwan Yin's tear create a non-obvious angle on grief transformation, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
