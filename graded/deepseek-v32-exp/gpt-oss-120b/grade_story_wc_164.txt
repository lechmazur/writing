<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and drives the plot, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. However, the lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene prevents a higher score, as the quick test for 9+ is not fully met.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (bridge restoration) and felt cost (warm melancholy), under a coherent causal lens. The crater glass and seeds persistently constrain tactics, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The iridescent cave and crystal geode are vividly described and actively pressure choices, with sensory details integrated into action. The setting constrains Maren's quest and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maren's agency using the seeds and glass, narrowing options to restore the bridge with legible cost (emotional resonance). The dominant stake is clear and tightens under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer about emotional resonance and memory without moralizing. Subtext operates through image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure, with rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, though minor density in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the lyrical concept that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation of tropes through specific details.</comment>
