<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, but lacks deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as the archive breathes and trust is mended under a causal lens; orientation is immediate, and persistent constraints shape tactics, but the keeper's late appearance is a minor flaw.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the archive and ink well constraining choices and charging the final image; details are selective and purposeful, integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early, escalation is driven by Elara's agency in decoding glyphs, and cost is legible in the balance of exhilaration and duty, all under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and synthesized organically, with risk-taking in poetic style that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; transformation of tropes through specific details.</comment>
