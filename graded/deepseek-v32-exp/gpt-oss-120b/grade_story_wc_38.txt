<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Selene's motivation to encrypt vulnerability as strength is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion through dance and journaling. Her final choice to seal the crystal is earned by prior causality, showing a credible endurance. However, some abstraction in interiority slightly limits depth, but micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost as the lab rises and dice fall silent, under an accumulative/textural lens that holds. Orientation is clear early, and the liberation shift is legible with cost in the crystal's pulse echoing her heartbeat. The pattern of dance and code pays off at closure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory setting pressures choices through the rising tide and sealed door, constraining tactics and charging the final image of the lab rising. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, integrated with action, such as rusted steel and luminous algae ink, enhancing atmosphere without generic clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Selene's agency under the accumulative lens, with dance and journal entries increasing density and reweighting stakes. The cost is legible when the dice clatter and reveal the crystal, foreclosing options. Pressure coheres through the tide and lab's response, though the internal conflict lacks multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability encrypted as strength emerges through concrete actions like dancing and journaling, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the crystal sealed in the journal, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with a consistent perceptual signature through Selene's POV. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in phrases like "a quiet rebellion against the pressure of the ocean." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure. The prose's poetic texture supports the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language, such as "time unfolded as a spider spins its web," is coherent and purposeful. Sentences advance story and atmosphere seamlessly, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats like the liberation moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh synthesis of code-breaking and vulnerability, transforming tropes through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
