<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, driving key choices like decoding the cipher and operating the floodgate. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions (e.g., feeling the compassion pulse through her fingertips), though some abstract phrasing ("encrypted compassion") slightly weakens peak beats. The final choice to use the floodgate for unity is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the stone's settled tremble.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the floodgate operating on shared empathy, reconfiguring the city's conflict with felt cost (the elder's doubts silence). The hybrid drive lens (causal and accumulative) holds, linking Mira's actions to resolution. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening from decoding to unity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The amphitheater setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices (e.g., the trembling stone guides Mira's actions) and charging the final image (water glinting like sapphire). Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, with the environment evolving causally. The volcano's breath integrates atmosphere with plot pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preservation vs. progress) escalates under the hybrid lens through Mira's agency, from decoding to turning the valve, narrowing options with cost (the tremble subsides into unity). Protagonist-driven escalation is clear, and the resolution forecloses conflict with a visible price in the reconfigured council dynamics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through events and images (e.g., the chain as a "living ledger of feelings"), resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to harmony, though "encrypted compassion" leans slightly abstract. Subtext operates in gestures like the elder's clasp, enriching complexity without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending poetic diction ("stone seats shifted with each sigh") and rhythmic control. Voice modulates with pressure (e.g., prose intensifies at climax), and elision (like the cipher's decoding) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid with strong propulsion, though minor overwriting ("low hymn of measurements") occurs without muddying clarity. No loops or scaffold artifacts; syntax varies purposefully, and the final image resonates. Information density is high, advancing story and atmosphere seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes unique elements (volcanic amphitheater, encrypted compassion) with specificity, transforming tropes through grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry. The closure feels inevitable, with originality rooted in character and world logic.</comment>
