<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her choices under pressure. Her final step onto the water is earned by prior causality, with embodied emotion and micro-choices. The trait "sensibly eccentric" is mentioned but not deeply integrated, though it doesn't harm closure. Quick test passed: contradictory impulses aren't strong, but the choice is earned with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost in Mara's realization that explanations fail in surrender. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with orientation clear early. The compass and lagoon shape tactics, and cost is legible in the final image. Quick test passed: closure with cost, lens holds, persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the subterranean lagoon constraining choices and charging the final image. Details like "mineral musk" and water staircase are purposeful and filtered through POV. Micro-setting alters tactics when Mara steps onto the liquid glass. Quick test passed: environment constrains choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative lens, from psychometry to stepping onto the water. Dominant stake (finding where explanations fail) tightens with cost in surrender. One meaningful deepening is sufficient. Quick test passed: agency-driven escalation with unmistakable cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, with subtext in images like the water staircase. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mara's realization, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete experience. Quick test passed: ending reweights without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Poetic prose reflects Mara's mindset, and elision (e.g., psychometry mechanics) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift. Quick test passed: distinct voice, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied syntax, with clear propulsion and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, even in peak beats. Rhythm supports atmosphere without obscuring clarity. Quick test passed: no loops, clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh with non-obvious synthesis (petrichor collector, hinged awakenings). Tropes are transformed through specific choices, and emotional truth avoids generic templates. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Quick test passed: synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
