<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with embodied curiosity and duty. Interiority is concrete in moments like tuning the scanner, but peaks in emotional depth are occasionally abstract. The final choice to guard the echo is earned, with visible cost in the weight of responsibility, though some micro-choices lack contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, building through sensory details to a Charged Poise closure where the promise to protect voices reconfigures meaning. Causality is clear in the pulse-tracing sequence, and cost is legible in the "weight of incidental heroism." Orientation is anchored early, and the structure coheres with one meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the atrium, hearing aid, and photograph constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "marble tears" and "faint violet of twilight" are purposeful and filtered through POV, evolving with the narrative to heighten stakes without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of protecting vulnerable voices escalates under the Accumulative lens through the protagonist's agency in tracing pulses and restoring the voice. A meaningful tightening occurs at the alcove discovery, with cost felt in the responsibility assumed. However, escalation is more gradual than sharply causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory and incidental heroism emerges organically through images like the hearing aid's pulse and restored photograph, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to loss. Subtext operates in whispers and light, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material with complexity, though it leans slightly toward assertion in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that filters details through the tracer's worldview. Rhythmic control is evident in phrases like "cartographer of sighs," and elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure, though dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied syntax, advancing story and atmosphere without major artifacts. Figurative language like "circuitry humming like a dying heart" is coherent and purposeful. Minor overwriting in repeated "reeling hush" does not harm closure; momentum is maintained with high information density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of a "contact tracer for hearts" is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in poetic style and stakes heightens meaning without gimmickry. Specific details like the hearing aid's transmitter transform familiar tropes through grounded, character-driven choices.</comment>
