<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Characters exhibit consistent traits and micro-choices under pressure, but lack deep interior contradiction or significant growth; the veiled dreamer's actions are observational rather than decision-driving, though motivation remains clear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong with pattern-based causality; closure lands decisively with cost in perseverance and revelation, anchored early and coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly immersive and constrains choices (e.g., watch and library mechanics charge the final garden image); sensory details are selective and purposeful, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency in decoding and documentation; cost is legible in effort, though escalation is more accumulative than causal under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken stories emerges organically through images like the petal garden; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic rhythm; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., propagation delays) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful with varied rhythm and high information density; no major artifacts or loops, though some figurative language borders overwriting without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh, specific details (e.g., cyclical cipher and living library); risk-taking in style and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
