<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and drives the narrative, with embodied emotion and internal conflict shown through the procedural generation of past selves. The final choice to embrace fractured timelines is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the tablet's dissolution. However, some abstraction in interiority slightly limits concrete characterization under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost—the tablet dissolves as he accepts his selves, achieving peace. The accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, reinforced by the viaduct and algorithm patterning. Orientation is clear early, and the cost is proof-tested in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposeful, with the viaduct and rainwater influencing choices and charging the final image. Details are selective and POV-filtered, constraining tactics through the glowing stones and fractured timelines. The environment actively shapes the protagonist's path and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled in conquering the labyrinth of self, escalating through the protagonist's agency in retracing steps via procedural generation. Under the accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, with cost unmistakable in the tablet's dissolution and his upward fall. Agency drives escalation, though some abstraction may dilute pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of self-acceptance emerges organically through images and events, such as the tablet's pulses and fractured timelines, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the dissolution and upward fall, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates effectively in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature that reflects the protagonist's mind under pressure. Rhythmic control and purposeful compression enhance the accumulative design, and any elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story and atmosphere without major artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, though occasional dense phrases may slight clarity. No loops or scaffolds harm closure; propulsion remains strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of gravity defiance, fractured timelines, and procedural self-maze, transforming tropes through specific choices. Risk-taking in abstract narrative heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the concept feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth and specificity anchor the innovation.</comment>
