<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to forgive himself is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "heart throbbed with a fierce repose"). The final renunciation is earned through prior causality in the labyrinth, with visible cost when he lets go of the pawn. However, minor stock phrasing in emotional description slightly limits peak impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the tutor forgives himself and the labyrinth dissolves, with cost legible in the dissolution of the pawn. Causal lens holds strong throughout, driven by the tutor's actions. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the labyrinth shapes tactics effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the time-frozen village and platinum labyrinth constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details (e.g., "wind that never moved") are selective and filtered through the POV. The environment actively pressures the protagonist's journey, supporting theme and stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of self-forgiveness escalates under the causal lens through the tutor's agency in decoding the tapestry and confronting regrets in the labyrinth. Cost is unmistakable when he releases the pawn, altering his state. Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness emerges organically through chess metaphors and the labyrinth's journey, with subtext in actions like untangling threads. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("forgiveness was not a single move but a series of openings") without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature rooted in chess strategy. Voice modulates under pressure (e.g., rhythmic prose in climax), and purposeful elision (e.g., "woven hush") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm and information density, but minor overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "woven hush" repetition) slightly dulls peak beats. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion remains clear, and closure is unharmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of chess, labyrinth, and time-frozen elements feels organic and inevitable, with specific details elevating emotional truth. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure reconfigures familiar tropes through character-driven choices.</comment>
