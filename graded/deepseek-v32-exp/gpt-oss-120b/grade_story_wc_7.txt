<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with embodied actions like tasting memories. However, internal conflict is minimal, and the characterization leans toward single-note wisdom without contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as the greenhouse becomes a beacon of hope, cost legible in the transformation. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with orientation anchored early, though the celestial alignment's causality is slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is vividly rendered with sensory detail, constraining choices and charging the final image. Specificity in decay and renewal integrates with action, avoiding generic setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes of creating beauty from ruins escalate through Mara's agency and the celestial event, narrowing options with visible cost in the pruning and seed sprouting. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of renewal emerges through concrete events and images, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gestures like whispering to vines, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, perceptual signature in sensory filtering, and controlled rhythm. Minimal dialogue serves subtext and advancement without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid with strong rhythm, but occasional overwriting in metaphors slightly muddles peak beats. No major loops or artifacts, and propulsion remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of culinary magic and sci-fi elements feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like memory-tasting. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
