<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's claustrophobia and motivation to "stand by the unremembered" are clear and consistent, driving her actions under pressure. Interiority is embodied through trembling hands and shallow breath, and her final ease feels earned, though the resolution of claustrophobia is somewhat swift. Micro-choices, like aligning the codex, reveal values, but internal conflict lacks deep contradiction. Cost is legible in her triumph.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Mara buries the codex and feels at ease, with cost felt in her overcame fear. Causal lens holds tightly from entry to return, with phase transition and tide apex escalating stakes. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and no causality breaks occur; the final image reconfigures her purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with rusted doors, salt scent, and cable farms, constraining choices via tide and phase arrays. Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered, such as the codex pulsing with currents. The environment charges the final image through resonant cables and sea echoes, ensuring indispensability.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes of tracking invisible things and overcoming claustrophobia escalate under causal lens via tide rise and phase transition risks. Mara's agency drives escalation through codex alignment and return activation, with cost legible in the void risk and emotional triumph. One meaningful tightening forecloses options with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance emerges organically from codex use and cable shrines, without moralizing. Subtext operates in images like gold flecks as beacons and sea-foam etchings. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mara's renewed purpose, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with poetic voice reflecting Mara's spelunker perspective through rhythmic prose and sensory bias. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in phase transitions. Voice modulation under pressure, like "crashing hush," enhances coherence without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, advancing story through varied syntax and strong verbs. Minor overwriting in metaphors like "jellyfish bellies" occurs but doesn't harm clarity or closure. No loops or scaffolds; rhythm supports propulsion, and final image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in fresh synthesis of spelunker, codex, and undersea cables, transforming tropes through specific details like phase transitions and tidal timeframe. Risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the concept feels inevitable in hindsight, supporting closure.</comment>
