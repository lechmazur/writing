<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marlow's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, driving his actions to revitalize the library. His weariness and stubbornness are embodied through specific choices, such as occupying impossible spaces, and his final respite feels earned. However, interior contradiction is underdeveloped, with no strong conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, with the library's transformation offering a charged poise and felt cost in Marlow's weight lifting. The drive lens holds consistently, and orientation is clear early. The package arrival sets up causality, but its mystery remains unresolved, slightly dampening closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The submerged library setting constrains choices and charges the final image, such as the floating pedestal and water pressure affecting the light. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, with phosphorescent ink and bioluminescent fish enhancing atmosphere. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment actively shapes Marlow's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled around giving rest to souls, escalating through Marlow's agency under the accumulative lens, such as reassembling the lens and its pulsing light. Cost is legible in the spirits' settlement and Marlow's respite. However, escalation relies more on texture than causal tightening, limiting peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of rest and memory emerges organically through images like the lighthouse lens and glowing tablets, without moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer through the library's transformation into a sanctuary. Subtext operates in silences and implications, such as "chased stillness" resonating beyond the plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct poetic voice that reflects Marlow's perception, such as "footsteps on a grave." Rhythm and diction are controlled under pressure, with purposeful elision in descriptive passages. No head-hopping or register drift, and the voice consistently deepens atmosphere.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical, with varied sentence rhythms and high information density, advancing story and atmosphere. No major artifacts or loops, though minor overwriting occurs in phrases like "fractured hope." Closure image remains clear, and momentum is sustained through selective, concrete details.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes undertaker, submerged library, and distress signals into a fresh, non-obvious angle on grief and rest. Specificity in details like the broken lens and phosphorescent ink avoids cliché, and the closure feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
