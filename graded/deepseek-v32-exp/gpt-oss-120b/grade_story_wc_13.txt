<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority (e.g., pendant warm against skin) and micro-choices under pressure (sketching to anchor herself). The final choice to release the pendant is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (restoring the city's rhythm) and conceptual cost under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the interrupted cadence shapes tactics throughout, with cost legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective (e.g., "lattice of stone ribs"), filtered through Mira's POV, and constrains choices (canals guide journey). The environment charges the final image, with sensory details integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the accumulative lens, with stakes tightening through cadence patterns. Cost is legible when she releases the pendant, foreclosing options and restoring rhythm with a felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of time and echoes emerges from events and images, not statement, with subtext in the pendant's symbolism. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature (e.g., illustrator's focus on light and patterns). Rhythmic control under pressure, no head-hopping, and purposeful elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and enhances clarity, even in peak beats like the pendant's release.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of urban fantasy and time manipulation, with specific details (giant's nap, echoes) that feel inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
