<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure; her balanced curiosity is shown through actions like adopting edge geometry and the final renunciation of placing the anchor link, earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the "somber promise" and anchor link's symbolic weight; the Hybrid drive lens (accumulative dominant) holds, and orientation is anchored early; the mosaic structure with legible transitions coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and specific, with sensory details like "flickering bioluminescent algae" and "cold iron glinting"; the benthic city pressures choices by necessitating new navigation, and the anchor link as a recurring object constrains tactics and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigating by starlight) escalates through Mira's agency under the Hybrid lens, with cost legible in the "somber marvel" and balance between tradition and progress; one meaningful tightening occurs with the test vessel success.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of balance between depth and sky emerges organically from images and events, like the anchor link and edge geometry; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, reflecting Mira's navigation expertise; no head-hopping, and rhythmic control supports pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent, and line-level craft advances story with clarity, e.g., "sonar arrays treat each photon as a node."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing deep-sea and cosmic elements with alien navigation; the premise is transformed through specific details like edge geometry and the anchor link, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
