<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to understand home is clear and intensifies through embodied micro-choices like pressing the feather deeper. Interiority is concrete with sensory specifics (e.g., "vibration thrumming through the marrow"), though contradictory impulses under pressure are subtle. The final renunciation—placing the stone back—is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the mountain's slowed heartbeat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration where home becomes a summonable resonance, with cost legible in the mountain's inhalation and Lira's readiness. Orientation is immediate, and the mosaic of dream shards integrates seamlessly without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice (e.g., corridors guiding discovery) and charges the final image with pulsing vellum and stone ribs. Sensory details (pine resin, old ink) are selective and POV-filtered, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation occurs through density increases in dream-scapes and the feather's use, driven by Lira's agency. The stake—understanding home—tightens via pattern breaks (e.g., the hum unveiling a new corridor), with cost felt in confronting fractured recollections.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars like the stone's felt maps and the feather's texture, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—home as a melody—that reweights prior material without statement, supported by the final image of seeded stories.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "pools of liquid metal" eyes). Lyrical compression and patterned diction (e.g., "hidden thunder") are taught early and pay off at closure. No head-hopping; voice modulates with emotional pressure consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("seed forgotten memories," "storm clouds") is purposeful and coherent, though slightly dense in peaks. Sentence propulsion varies naturally with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of seer, stone, and bookstore mountain, transforming tropes through specific lived detail. Risk-taking in accumulative, lyric design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
