<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation is clear and drives the narrative; his reactively visionary trait is embodied in actions like sensing story directions, and the transition from exile to community feels earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative lens, with cost felt in the transformation from isolation to communal purpose; the structure builds coherently through fragments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ivory harbor and brass valve constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details like "glistened like shattered glass" are selective and purposeful, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the archivist's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in the communal gathering; stakes in meaning-making tighten through fragment collection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the ongoing quest; subtext in silences enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively lyrical, with perceptual signature reflecting the archivist's vision; rhythmic control under pressure supports the accumulative pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with high information density; minor figurative density doesn't obscure clarity, and sentence variety maintains momentum without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes archival work and sea mythology in a non-obvious way; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
