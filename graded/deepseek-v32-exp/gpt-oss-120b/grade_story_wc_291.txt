<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's face-blindness and methodical nature are consistently embodied, driving her choices; her awakening empathy is earned through on-page actions, though the phrase "dormant empathy" risks diagnostic label-speak but is mitigated by concrete dramatization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative lens, with the quarry's fissure and tear providing cost; orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity, though the evidence disappearance backstory is slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The quarry setting constrains choices and charges the final image with the fissure and tear; sensory details are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Mara's perception to build atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Mara's agency, with cost legible in the quarry's response; stakes tighten through her painting and the revealed names, though the cold cases' urgency could be more visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of unifying opposites and empathy emerges through concrete images and events, avoiding moralizing; the ending reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity, such as the voids in the portrait.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic rhythm control; no head-hopping, and elision (e.g., the evidence disappearance) is taught and paid off, though some diction edges toward ornament.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with minimal artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and coherent, though minor overwriting occurs in peaks (e.g., "lance of pigment pierce the darkness").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of face-blind artist and cold cases feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors emotional truth.</comment>
