<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The fisher's cool-headedness and longing are consistently embodied, with micro-choices under pressure, such as turning emotion into a "silver line." The final renunciation—setting the echo free—is earned by prior causality, though some abstract phrasing slightly dilutes specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orientation is clear within 120 words; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with patterns building to a Charged Poise closure where the echo's capture and release reconfigure meaning. Cost is legible when the fisher's longing dissolves, but minor abstraction in causality prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sound wave garden and rail spike constrain choices and charge the final image, with vivid sensory details like "midnight flowers" and "pulse" guiding tactics. Specificity is purposeful, elevating atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the fisher's agency under the Accumulative lens, as patterns break and reassemble, forcing a trade-off when he sets the echo free. Cost is felt in the reconfiguration of his purpose, though the abstract intensity slightly blunts visceral impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images like the "feral lullaby" and echo, offering a non-literal answer to longing and freedom without moralizing. Subtext in silence and pattern breaks creates lingering ambiguity, though hairline abstraction in peak beats limits perfection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, such as "transliterates emotions into currents," and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off, but minor ornate density prevents a 9+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, though slight overwriting in phrases like "sleepwalking constellations" causes minor muddle without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sound waves, constellations, and emotional transliteration feels inevitable, with risk-taking in abstract style heightening stakes. The core premise is transformed through specific details, and closure reweights prior material with undeniable cost.</comment>
