<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her traits as a blind artisan; her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion shown through sensory perception. The final calm is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her renunciation of anxiety, though minor lack of contradictory impulses in scene keeps it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mara achieves calm assurance; the accumulative/textural lens holds, with cost felt in the promise of new horizons. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of blindness shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated, with the mist and water refraction constraining choice and charging the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, reflecting Mara's POV. The depot pressures choices through its atmosphere and resources.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative lens, with stakes in the drone repair tightening as the ship departs; cost is legible in the successful patch and her calm, though the pressure could be more intense.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of repair and insight emerges through events and images, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with meaningful ambiguity. Subtext operates in the mist and calm, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with Mara's perceptual signature shaped by blindness; voice is lyrical and consistent, with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or figurative muddle. Minor overwriting in dense sensory phrases, but clarity is maintained at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of blind artisan, drone, and mist feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details transform familiar tropes.</comment>
