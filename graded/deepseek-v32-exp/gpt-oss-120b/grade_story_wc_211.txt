<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Harel's motivation to archive emotional patterns is clear and consistent, driving his actions such as immersing in the orchard and decoding the prophecy. Interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., feeling "velvet disquiet" and the prophecy's weight "settle like dew." His final choice to record the prophecy is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the sealing act. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws are minimal and do not touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Harel records the prophecy, understanding its loop, with cost legible in "sealing it with a drop of his own ink." The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory details and memories. Orientation is clear within 120 words, anchoring who, where, and when. Persistent constraint of archiving shapes tactics, and the ending reweights options without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the orchard atop a skyscraper and the phonograph constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, e.g., fruit trembling and phonograph sounds. The environment pressures Harel's immersion and decoding, integral to the closure. No generic or static description; micro-setting elements like the wax cylinder are indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving memory escalates under the accumulative lens through Harel's agency: hearing the prophecy, using memory to decode, and recording it. Cost is unmistakable in the final sealing act, narrowing options and foreclosing paths. Pressure coheres and tightens with one meaningful deepening. No coincidence or off-stage resolution; escalation is driven by protagonist choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and prophecy as a loop emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement. Subtext operates in gestures like the phonograph's song and dead languages. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Harel's realization, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and earned through specifics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic and consistent, e.g., "velvet disquiet" and "orchard seemed to exhale." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure. Diction remains within Harel's lexicon, and prose reflects his mind state without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, e.g., "weight settle like dew" enhances without muddle. Read-aloud test passes with natural variation. Minor overwriting in dense descriptions but does not obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines through a non-obvious synthesis of scribe, dead languages, and emotional archives in a futuristic setting, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed via specific grounded choices, like the prophecy as a map. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
