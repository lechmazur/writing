<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aric's motivation is clear and intensifies, with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure; the final incorporation of failure is earned, though internal conflict could be more nuanced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost when the chipped die faces up, reweighting the premise; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds with persistent constraints shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The infinite staircase and dice function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details are vivid and purposeful, integrated with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Aric's agency under the Accumulative lens, with cost legible when he incorporates the flaw; stakes tighten meaningfully around perpetual motion and missed opportunities.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on imperfection and persistence; subtext in the dice and staircase avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative but purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm; no major loops or artifacts, though some metaphors are complex.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of math, chance, and metaphor feels inevitable; risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
