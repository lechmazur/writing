<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with embodied emotion under pressure. Micro-choices, like spreading the speaker cloth, reveal hierarchy of values. Final renunciation of past applause is earned by prior causality with visible cost, satisfying the quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative drive lens holds throughout, with clear orientation early. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the valley's echo and personal breath mingling reconfigure purpose with felt cost. Persistent constraint of shame shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory detail filtered through POV. The quarry dust and speaker grille cloth charge the final image, constraining choice and mirroring internal state. Quick test satisfied as environment decisively shapes closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, escalation occurs through density increase in reflection and image, driven by protagonist agency. Dominant stake of finding purpose after loss tightens via his decision to embrace a new stage, with cost legible in the emotional trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the cloth and applause concept, avoiding moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of quarry lights and rewritten encore, reweighting prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice modulates under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., "after the applause") is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and propulsion without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, with varied syntax supporting rhythm. No artifacts obscure causality or closure, satisfying the quick test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ex-roadie and appraiser roles feels inevitable, with risk-taking in accumulative structure heightening stakes. Specific details like the cloth scrap transform tropes through grounded choices, and closure recharges prior material without gimmickry.</comment>
