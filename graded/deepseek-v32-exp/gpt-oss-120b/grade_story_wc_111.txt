<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The vine dresser's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority showing contradictory impulses in the "blooming withering" duality. His micro-choices under pressure, like polishing marbles, reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final acknowledgment feels earned by prior causality. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing; emotions are concretely filtered through his perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost in "the weight of both bloom and rot," and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout. Causality is tight, with each polished marble leading to new pathways, and orientation is anchored early. The persistent constraint of the cracked marbles shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The garden maze constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "vines curling like whispered promises" filtered through the POV. The marbles and oak tree function as micro-settings that evolve and pressure decisions. Spatial choreography is coherent, and description is woven into action without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency in polishing marbles, under the Accumulative lens, with cost legible in the "trembling ground" and his felt paradox. The dominant stake of proving gardens know gardeners tightens through each ritual, foreclosing options without coincidence. A single meaningful deepening reweights the stake with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the "blooming withering symphony," without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the garden's whisper, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, and earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars like the polished marbles.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, rhythmic prose that modulates with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, as in the patterned description of the maze pulsing. Voice remains consistent under pressure, with no register drift or exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors like "pulsed with a quiet rhythm" and "whispered promises" slightly muddles peak beats, but no loops or scaffolds. Closure image remains clear, and diction is voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of garden-keeper pact feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details like cracked marbles and measurable luck. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth in perseverance avoids generic templates, and the final reconfiguration is bold yet coherent.</comment>
