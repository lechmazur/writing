<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. However, internal conflict is subtle, lacking contradictory impulses in scene, and the final choice, while earned, doesn't fully showcase layered hypocrisy or self-deception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—the city revived through music—and cost is legible in the dust swirling and Mara's quiet pride. Causal lens holds tightly from broadcast to performance, with the shortwave radio as a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory details (e.g., "glow like fireflies," "mist curled tighter") that pressure choices—the alcove and radio constrain Mara's actions and charge the final image of the sanctuary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens, from hearing the broadcast to transcribing and playing it, with cost unmistakable in the crowd's revival and dust's transformation. Stakes are tightly braided and culminate in a meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of art reviving silence emerges organically through events and images, like dust humming stories, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the charged poise of the alcove and radio's watch.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic diction ("thistled calm," "luminous glow") and perceptual signature. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off, though dialogue is absent and voice remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, advancing momentum without obscuring clarity in peak beats like the broadcast playback.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes pirate broadcasts and dust storytelling with freshness and inevitability, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels earned.</comment>
