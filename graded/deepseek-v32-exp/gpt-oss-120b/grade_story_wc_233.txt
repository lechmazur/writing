<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The queen's motivation is clear and rooted in disenchantment and haunted dreams, driving her to seek the grotto. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion like the crown feeling heavy, and her final transformation is earned through causal actions, such as breathing on the orb. Micro-choices under pressure, like urging the retinue forward, reveal her values, and the change from disenchanted to tempered by starlight has visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the plot advances via because/therefore linkages: because of her dreams, she seeks the grotto, leading to the orb's revelation. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—the orb bursts, dreams dissolve, and she is transformed. Orientation is anchored early, and the lens holds consistently, with the grotto's pulse shaping tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with sensory details like "air tasted of iron and old rain" and the grotto's pulse guiding the queen's choices. The ember grotto constrains and charges the climax, as its rhythm matches her doubts and leads to the orb. Spatial choreography is clear during the ascent, and the cobalt grotto above clouds serves as a resonant final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling dreams escalates under the Causal lens through the queen's agency, such as climbing and interacting with the orb. Cost is legible when the orb bursts, dissolving dreams and transforming her. Pressure tightens meaningfully in the grotto, foreclosing her disenchantment with a visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges through images like bleeding starlight and the orb, without moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer, as she binds starlight to the realm, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures like the shared exhale, but some abstraction slightly limits resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature filtering details through the queen's bias. Voice modulates with pressure, from "softly commanding" to whispers, and elision like the retinue's obedience is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but functional, and rhythm controls propulsion without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story and atmosphere. However, slight overwriting occurs in peak beats, such as "bleeding starlight" repeated, though not mixed. No major loops or scaffolds, and clarity remains at closure, but minor figurative density prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of disenchanted royalty with mystical elements feels fresh and inevitable, transformed through specific details like the ember grotto. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure image recharges prior material. Some familiarity in the quest structure limits originality.</comment>
