<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing her decisively kind nature; motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling her actions, though minor stock phrasing ("quiet duty settle like dew") slightly limits peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Mr. Harlan's death and the keepsake ritual; Accumulative lens holds throughout, with orientation clear early and pattern taught via sensory density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details (pine and rain scent, vinyl light) that charge the final image; the broken vinyl object constrains choice and reweights meaning, though the haven's role is more atmospheric than pressuring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (flawless goodbye) escalates under Accumulative lens through Mara's agency in music and ritual; cost is legible in the death and transformation, but escalation is more cadence shift than causal tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hope from brokenness emerges organically through symbols (vinyl, scent) and events; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, supported by subtext in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and lyrical rhythm; voice remains coherent under pressure, and elision (e.g., "hymning the mundane") is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control with minimal artifacts; minor overwriting ("pulsing stillness that was alive") occurs but doesn't obscure closure, and no loops or scaffold harm momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes hospice care with broken vinyl in a non-obvious, transformative way; specificity in details and risk-taking in lyric mode heighten stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
