<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is clear and rooted in her past, compelling higher-stakes choices under pressure. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion like "comforting unease," and micro-choices under pressure reveal values. However, the abstraction in "capture the sound of trust breaking" slightly limits depth, though it is dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as the "comforting unease" reconfigures the truce's fragility, under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the sunrise timeframe shapes tactics. The lock cracking and lantern hurling are decisive changes with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "salt and ferment" and "rotting pier," constraining choices such as Lila's movement through shadows and use of the lantern storage. The environment charges the final image with the market stirring under the pier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lila's agency under the causal lens, from the decoy vial to seizing the lanterns, narrowing options with cost in the broken hush. The stake in maintaining the truce tightens meaningfully, though the climax resolves a bit quickly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images like the watch fob and "sound of trust breaking," offering a resonant, non-literal answer to cycles of conflict without moralizing. The ending's "comforting unease" reweights prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with lyrical phrases like "rumors that tasted like iron," and perceptual signature is consistent. Rhythmic control under pressure is strong, though minor repetition in "comforting unease" occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with purposeful sensory detail. No major artifacts, but slight repetition of "comforting unease" and "false starts" slightly dulls momentum without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of pirate market and truce of hush, with specific details feeling organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in tone and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure reconfigures meaning.</comment>
