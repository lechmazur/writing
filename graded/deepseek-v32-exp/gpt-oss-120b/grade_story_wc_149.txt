<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply integrated with motive; the ghost bride's "lovingly venomous" affection and debt-driven actions create a compelling arc. Interiority is concrete and embodied, such as her veil "clinging to her shoulders as if grieving the sun." The final sacrifice is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her fading.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost as she fades, leaving the bead to pulse. The accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, building through repetitive imagery and actions. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the debt constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the alchemical orchard greenhouse and carved stone bead constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, e.g., "wind sang a low, metallic hymn." The environment directly influences the protagonist's actions and the story's resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (repaying the debt) and escalate under the accumulative lens through the ghost bride's agency, such as placing the bead and releasing a sigh. Cost is legible in her fading, and the escalation tightens meaningfully toward closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events, such as "mournful elation" and the bead's glow, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to redemption and debt, reweighting prior material through the final sacrifice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with a consistent perceptual signature filtered through the ghost bride's perspective. POV is stable, and rhythmic control under pressure enhances the accumulative design. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off, e.g., "veil scattering like ash." Clarity and propulsion are maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of ghost lore and alchemical redemption, with specific details like the "carved stone bead" feeling inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the concept is fully integrated.</comment>
