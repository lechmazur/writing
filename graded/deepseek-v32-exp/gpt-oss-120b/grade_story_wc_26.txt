<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation to preserve hope is clear and drives choices; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as feeling the stone's weight echo the library's pulse. The final transformation is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the luminous regret melting into gratitude. However, some abstraction in emotional states slightly limits depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost legible in the "weight of centuries lift" and the stone's warming. The lens holds consistently, and orientation is clear early. The revelation feels earned through patterned imagery, though the shadow's introduction is slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image, as the library's "blooming vines" and "clouds" mirror internal transformation. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, such as the stone "cold as moonlight" and the "soft perfume of rain-kissed clouds." The environment actively shapes the protagonist's actions and the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative/Textural lens is driven by protagonist agency, with cost visible in the "luminous regret" and the stone's warming. The dominant stake of preserving hope tightens through the comparison of footage, though the pressure coheres without multiple reversals, fitting the scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images and events, such as the mirrored silhouettes and the stone's glow, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to hope and memory. Subtext operates in gestures like whispering to the stone, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in the poetic, rhythmic prose. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, such as in "every soft footfall... a note in a symphony of remembrance." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, but minor overwriting occurs, like "softly deliberate" repetition, though it doesn't obscure closure. No major artifacts or loops; sentences advance story and atmosphere effectively, with clear propulsion in peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of elements like the library above clouds and shareable dreams, transformed through specific character choices. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with bold execution.</comment>
