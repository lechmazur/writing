<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Selene's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions like "gloomy cheerfulness" showing contradictory impulses. Her micro-choices, such as placing the seashell and reading the ledger, reveal character under pressure, and the final realization is earned by prior causality. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing; interiority is concrete and particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a conceptual repricing with cost, as Selene's realization that myths endure through retelling reweights her myth-busting quest. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory details and pattern shifts. Orientation is clear early, with who, where, and when anchored within 120 words. The persistent constraint of the seashell and cello shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the observatory, seashell, and cello constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Selene's POV, such as "cracked window pane" and "dust-laden ribbons." Micro-setting elements like the cello act as tools that alter tactics, supporting the narrative drive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding the riddle escalates under the accumulative lens through density increases in the hums and ledger discovery. Selene's agency drives turns, like retelling the legend, foreclosing paths with cost legible in her realized change. No coincidence; pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the seashell's glow and cello's hums, offering a non-literal answer about myth endurance. Subtext operates through implication, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material without statement, resonating through particulars like the "epistemic compass."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature reflecting Selene's curiosity. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, such as in "gloomy cheerfulness," and rhythmic control supports pressure. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats. No register drift or artifacts obscuring causality; sentences propel momentum selectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of myth-busting with magical realism, transforming tropes through specific details like the cello and seashell. Risk-taking in lyrical heightens stakes without gimmickry. The non-obvious integration feels inevitable in hindsight, supporting closure.</comment>
