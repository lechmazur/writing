<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Protagonist's "confidently uncertain" trait is embodied in micro-choices, with interior contradiction acting in scene; final renunciation of control for listening is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the humbled empowerment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal/textural) holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost felt in the "humbled and empowered" stance; anomaly's constraint shapes tactics throughout, and orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gravitational anomaly and exotic nib function as micro-setting, constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, with the pen "drinking ambient gravity" to alter history.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation under hybrid lens is driven by protagonist agency (using the pen to edit history), narrowing options from chaos to order; cost is legible in the "visible or felt price" of revising without erasing identity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of editing history without erasing lessons emerges through particulars like the garden metaphor; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "strange comfort" avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetically compressed yet clear, modulating under pressure ("unbent my own expectations"); no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, though minor overwriting in figurative language ("tangeld ribbons of light") does not harm closure; no loops or scaffolds detected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of editing history through gravitational anomaly and exotic nib feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric abstraction heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure remains legible.</comment>
