<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and evolves credibly from seeking death to finding solace in endings. Interiority is embodied and specific, with micro-choices under pressure, such as joining volunteers to hear endings. The final renunciation is earned through accumulated experiences, though the shift feels slightly abrupt but remains grounded in prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, with closure as a Conceptual Repricing where the protagonist redefines their purpose.

Orientation is clear early, and structure builds density toward a resonant reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seeking endings) escalates through accumulative density, driven by protagonist's agency in volunteering and listening.

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold.

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of euthanasia tourism with disaster relief feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight.
