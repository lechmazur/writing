<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final vow and the pollen release show an earned change, though internal contradiction is minimal, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration as the pollen vow seals the covenant, felt cost is legible in Mara's promise. Accumulative/textural lens holds strong with causal linkages from lyre-playing to vine response, and the harvest moon constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like dew and pine scent, integrated into action. The vine tendril and altar constrain choices and charge the final image, enhancing atmosphere without generic clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled with restoring rites, escalation driven by Mara's agency in playing the lyre and weaving songs. Cost is visible in the pollen vow and magic flow, tightening under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete actions like song-weaving, offering a non-literal answer on memory as remedy. Subtext in gestures (vine coiling) and the final image avoids moralizing, with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, poetic diction, and rhythmic control. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure, though dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "notes rose like sunbeams" is purposeful, though minor density in peaks slightly risks overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers fresh synthesis of memory and ritual restoration, with specific details transforming tropes. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
