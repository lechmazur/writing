<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The priest's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, but internal contradiction is underdeveloped, limiting depth. The final choice is earned by prior causality, but lacks strong contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost in the possession risk and stillness shattering, under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear early, but causality relies on abstract patterns rather than tight linkages.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with the cathedral and dimensional anchor constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through the priest's POV, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through the priest's agency under the Accumulative lens, with cost legible in the ticking possession clock. However, the resolution softens the cost slightly by averting dire consequences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events, offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the indigo light exposing hidden assumptions. Subtext is rich in metaphor without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic rhythm and perceptual signature consistent under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density, but minor overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., "dripped like honey over stone") slightly muddles peak beats without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of ritual and technology, with risk-taking in style and a non-obvious angle on illumination. Elements feel organic and indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>
