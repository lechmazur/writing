<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies, with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation is earned, though internal conflict could be more pronounced. Embodied emotion avoids stock phrasing, and the cost is legible in the translation becoming a beacon.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with felt cost as the fragment dissolves into shared memory, under an accumulative/textural lens. Patterns converge cleanly, and orientation is early and clear. The persistent constraint of intuition anchors shapes the final image, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the alchemist's market and lighthouse lens fragment constraining choices and charging the final image. Details are purposefully integrated into action, and the micro-setting alters tactics through the paintings and fragment's glow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of honoring overlooked histories is signaled early and escalates under the accumulative lens through protagonist agency in studying paintings. Cost is unmistakable in the dissolution and shared memory, though no major reversals occur, fitting the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in gestures like the lighthouse beam as memory. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the translator's realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure. The narrative stance remains consistent and effective throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats. Minor possible typo in opening does not harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and non-obvious, synthesizing the translator role with intuition anchors in a specific, memorable way. Risk-taking in accumulative style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
