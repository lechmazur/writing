<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, driving the narrative, but interiority lacks concrete embodiment and internal conflict is told rather than shown in scene. The final sacrifice is earned with felt cost, but emotional depth is somewhat abstract, limiting peak characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Mara's sacrifice reweaves silence, with cost legible in "leave something of herself behind." The accumulative/textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early, though causality is pattern-driven rather than tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the orchard and bamboo forest constraining choices via the puzzle map and bead guidance. Recurring objects charge the final image, and details are woven into action, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes (sending the message) escalate through Mara's agency in placing puzzle pieces, under the accumulative lens, with cost in her sacrifice. However, escalation is more gradual than tightening, and cost is implied rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice emerges organically through images and events, with the final line ("sacrifice... the loom of tomorrow") offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext is rich in gesture and silence, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature, though some phrases verge on purple prose. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure, with rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied rhythm, but occasional overwriting (e.g., "stoically sparkling" repetition) and decorative modifiers slightly blur clarity. No major loops or artifacts, and closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing loom spinning, raveling silence, and puzzle elements into an inevitable whole. Risk-taking in lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry, and transformation feels earned.</comment>
