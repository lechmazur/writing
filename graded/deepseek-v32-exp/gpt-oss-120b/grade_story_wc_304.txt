<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in trait, with embodied interiority, but lacks significant internal conflict or flaws that complicate choices under pressure; the final choice feels predetermined without palpable cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the aurora's dimming; Accumulative lens holds, and the threshold of stillness persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with the skyborne grotto and emerald chip constraining choice and charging the final image; sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled, and escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency in infusing the chip, with cost legible in the aurora's acknowledgment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of preserving light emerges organically through image and action, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext operates in implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature focused on patterns and stillness; lyrical prose maintains rhythmic control under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and vivid imagery, though minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "radiant hush" repetition) slightly dulls closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar elements with specificity, risking lyrical abstraction, but the beautician mortician role and skyborne setting feel fresh and integral to closure.</comment>
