<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The librarian's motivation is clear and drives the plot, but interiority lacks contradiction or flaws, making her feel uniformly virtuous without earned struggle. Actions align with motives, but the trait "empathetically decisive" is told rather than shown through embodied cost. Final choice is causally earned but lacks deep personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, as the city unifies through song and bridges, with cost felt in the healing of scars. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of sound and language builds cohesively. However, the escalation is simple, lacking a meaningful tightening that forecloses options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with the clock tower and silos constraining choices (e.g., the weight used for chimes) and charging the final image of bridges. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, but some descriptions verge on ornamental. Capped due to Q2 not reaching 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes of healing the city escalate through the librarian's agency in conducting chimes and directing bridge-building, with cost legible in workers' reactions and transformed silos. Under accumulative lens, density increases through layered languages, but the conflict lacks a pivotal turn that narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of unity through art and language emerges organically from events like interspersed languages and bridge-building, offering a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in woven sounds and etched planks resonates, but the concept leans slightly toward idealization over complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctively lyrical with rhythmic control, reflecting the librarian's perceptual signature. No head-hopping; prose modulates with emotional intensity. However, the voice occasionally slips into overly poetic abstraction under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density, but figurative language sometimes overwhelms clarity in peak beats (e.g., "like a mother guiding a newborn through storm"). No major loops or scaffold, but minor overwriting reduces momentum without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept of talking grain elevators and choral librarian is fresh, synthesized with specific details that feel inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulative design heightens stakes, but the transformation lacks grounding in genuine struggle, leaning on harmonious resolution.</comment>
