<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's involuntary truthfulness is consistently embodied and drives key choices; her motivation to preserve wonder is dramatized through micro-choices like reading the riddle and confessing to the drone, earning the closure with visible cost in the transformed city rhythm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal linkages propel the plot from riddle to key to tower revival; closure lands with a decisive change as the echo reconfigures the city's rhythm, and cost is legible in the final image of citizens gathering, with the lens holding firmly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lightning tower and lacquer box constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details like "oily sheen" and "amber veins" are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's POV to enhance atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes around preserving wonder escalate through Mara's agency in using the key; the cost is visible in the revival's impact on the city's ceremonies, tightening options under the causal lens without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of echo as collective voice emerges implicitly from the riddle and drone's response; the ending offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing, creating lingering resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; poetic diction like "nectar dusk" enhances tone without obscuring clarity, and minimal dialogue serves subtext in the drone interaction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high density and rhythmic variety without loops or artifacts; sentences like "cascade of light poured through glass rods" advance story and atmosphere seamlessly, with clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lightning harvesting and drone beehives feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric tone heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure integrates concepts cohesively with emotional specificity.</comment>
