<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lio's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His resilient positivity and secret goal to merge timelines are well-integrated, and the final action feels earned. However, some interiority edges toward diagnostic language, such as "intention can align the cosmos," slightly reducing immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal-hybrid lens with clear linkage from Lio's radio action to the ferry's reappearance. Closure is a decisive change with cost legible in the sand rising and passengers materializing. Orientation is strong early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, though the resolution leans slightly neat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory details like "cool mist" and "phosphorescent threads," constraining choices as the grotto and water directly enable the climax. The environment charges the final image, enhancing atmosphere without generic clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start with the vanishing ferry, escalating through Lio's agency with the radio broadcast. Cost is visible in the reversed time and merged timelines, tightening options under the hybrid lens. Minor deduction for the ease of resolution despite established pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of time and intention emerges organically through images like the hourglass and radio resonance, offering a non-literal answer at the end. Subtext is strong, but occasional near-moralizing in lines like "intention can align the cosmos" slightly undermines complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct with lyrical, poetic prose that reflects Lio's perspective. Rhythm controls pressure well, and experimental elements like the lattice of sound are taught and legible. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled with varied syntax, though minor figurative stacking in peaks like "lattice of sound that glimmered" causes slight muddle. No loops or scaffolding, but a touch of overwriting reduces clarity in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, transforming tropes of time travel with specific details like sound resonance and parallel timelines. Synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking with magical realism heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
