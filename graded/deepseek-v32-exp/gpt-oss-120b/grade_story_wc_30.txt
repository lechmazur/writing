<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The titan-gear librarian's motivation to preserve wonder is clear and drives key choices, with interiority shown through embodied perception (e.g., gears softening with moon phases). His final decision to let his identity migrate is earned by prior causality, though some emotional beats lean slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the glowing creel and softened gears, under a consistent accumulative/textural lens. The "tomorrow disappeared" event serves as a catalyst without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the tidal atrium breathing with tides and the creel's scent influencing actions. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the librarian's agency in smelting the key and using the creel, tightening the stake of preserving wonder under the accumulative lens. Cost is visible in the transformation of routine, though the escalation is more gradual than sharp.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of accepting contradictions emerges through concrete images like moon-phase fluctuations and the key smelting, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in the creel's whispers deepens the theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, gear-filtered perception that remains consistent under pressure. No dialogue, but rhythmic control and purposeful elision enhance the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats like the key forging.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of titan-gear librarian, migrating identities, and tidal atrium, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
