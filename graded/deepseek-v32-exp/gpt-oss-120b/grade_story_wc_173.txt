<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices that reveal values. However, the character lacks deep flaws or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, slightly limiting complexity. The final choice is earned through causality, with visible cost in the city's transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens, as the harvest of echoes rewrites the city's narrative with undeniable cost. Orientation is clear early, and causality is maintained through the courtesan's actions. The prism sanctuary's unlocking charges the final image with felt consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the silver courtyard and prism sanctuary constraining choices and charging the climax. Details like "ice and ink" taste and shimmering crystal are filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere. The environment actively shapes tactics and the final image of rebellion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (defying conformity) and escalate under the accumulative lens through density increases in the courtesan's actions. Agency drives the tightening, with cost legible in the shattered lullaby and awakened voices. One meaningful deepening forecloses the path of monotony.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and imagery, exploring rebellion through art without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like untangling threads and the final chorus. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to conformity, reweighting prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects the courtesan's mindset. Rhythm and diction control heighten pressure, and elision (e.g., "between sigh and smile") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift undermines coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, but occasional overwriting (e.g., "bodily poetic rhythm") slightly muddles clarity in peak beats. Rhythm varies purposefully, and no major artifacts harm closure, though some figurative stacking occurs without full pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of concepts like the chaste courtesan and harvest of echoes, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable from prior particulars.</comment>
