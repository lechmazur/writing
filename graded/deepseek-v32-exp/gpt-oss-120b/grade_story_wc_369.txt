<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and rooted in patience and folklore, with embodied emotion as he feels sorrow pulse and relief. Micro-choices like tracing dreams reveal values, but internal conflict is minimal, lacking contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost—sorrow transforms into peace—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The sextant's use and grid deconstruction flow logically, and cost is legible when Eli's chest eases and the tower inhales softly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the stormlit tower and moonlight filtering through shutters constraining choices. The sextant and oak tree charge the final image, and sensory details like groaning floorboards reflect POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming sorrow into peace—escalates through Eli's agency in mapping dreams and deconstructing the grid. Cost is visible as quantified grief turns to relief, narrowing options under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of mundane miracles emerges through concrete actions like unspooling dream-data, with subtext in images like the healing sextant. The ending offers a non-literal answer without moralizing, inviting reflection on quiet relief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, filtered through Eli's perception. Purposeful compression in phrases like "quantified sorrow" is taught early, and rhythmic control under pressure supports closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with varied syntax, but minor overwriting occurs in stacked metaphors like "dreams that floated like half-remembered songs." No loops or scaffold issues; momentum remains strong through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of labyrinth worker, broken sextant, and quantified sorrow feels inevitable, transforming magical realism tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
