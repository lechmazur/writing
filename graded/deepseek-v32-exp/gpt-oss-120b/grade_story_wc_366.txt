<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marek's motivation to bottle safety is clear and rooted in consistent traits, driving his ritual actions. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion in moments like the sea glass warming. The final commitment to protect feels earned by prior causality, though contradictory impulses are subtle. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, but the emotional progression lacks strong irrationality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as the lighthouse glows from collective memory, a charged poise with felt cost in the "luminescent ache." The accumulative/textural lens holds, with details building to the final image. Orientation is clear early, and the sea glass as a persistent constraint shapes tactics. No causality breaks; cost is legible in the transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with sensory details like "sigh of wind" and "cold stone slab" filtered through Marek's POV. The haunted lantern room acts as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image, altering tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve with the ritual, supporting theme without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation occurs through density increase in Marek's ritual, reweighting the dominant stake of safety and hope. Agency drives the deepening, with cost legible in the "soft pulse" and his vow to protect. The stakes are visceral, and the resolution is earned by his alteration, though the conflict is internal and quiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the ritual and the concept of bottling safety, with subtext in gestures and images. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the lighthouse's glow from memory, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Epiphanies are earned through specific experience, and ambiguity lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Marek's observant nature. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and syntax supports rhythm under pressure. No head-hopping; purposeful compression and elision are taught and paid off at closure. Diction remains within character lexicon, and free indirect style is clean.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is consistent and purposeful. Clarity and concision are maintained, though minor purple tones exist. Syntax propels the scene, and the final image is charged without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story synthesizes elements with originality, transforming tropes through specific, grounded choices like the stone-spiral ritual. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, and the premise offers a fresh angle on hope and memory.</comment>
