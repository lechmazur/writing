<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies under time pressure; her face-blindness shapes her unique perception and actions, with micro-choices like using the coin and mixing pigments revealing embodied emotion and hierarchy of values. The final endurance against demolition earns closure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the mural persisting amid demolition, costing the library's loss but affirming art's transcendence; Accumulative/Textural lens holds, orientation is clear early, and causality is tight with the coin and timeframe driving beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices—the tree trunk library's impending demolition heightens stakes, and sensory details (e.g., "light slipped through leaf-filled windows") charge the final image; environment constrains Lira's tactics and enriches atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (completing the mural before demolition) escalates through time pressure and Lira's agency, with cost legible in the building's fall; under Accumulative lens, density increases via precise actions, and the final image reweights options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of limits as thresholds emerges organically from Lira's struggle, with subtext in her coin-guided ritual and the mural's persistence; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, deepened by the conceptual repricing of destruction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature filtering through Lira's focus on light and rhythm; prose rhythm modulates with pressure, and purposeful compression (e.g., "fractally precise") supports clarity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with varied syntax and vivid imagery advancing story; no loops or scaffolds, and figurative language (e.g., "sunrise trapped in timber") coheres without muddle, sustaining momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes face-blind artist, condemned library, and ancient coin with originality; specific details feel inevitable, and risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
