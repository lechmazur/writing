<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied with consistent traits (e.g., walking backwards when nervous) and micro-choices under pressure; motivation to mentor resilience drives key turns, and the shift from retreat to confidence is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with cost (library healed, walls whisper gratitude) under a causal lens; orientation is clear early, and the tea leaf geometry and shadow object persist as constraints that shape tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is integral, with the library and objects like the shadow and teacups constraining choices and charging the closure; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the archivist's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency (decoding tea leaves, using the shadow) under the causal lens, with cost legible in the transformation of the library; one meaningful tightening forecloses options and reweights the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resilience and reversible exile emerges through concrete events and images (e.g., tea leaves, swing) without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a lyrical perceptual signature; voice remains coherent under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., tea leaf mechanics) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "dust lay like ancient whispers") slightly dulls momentum; no major artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is original and ingeniously synthesized (shard-mirror archivist, tea leaf geometry); risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the combination feels organic and inevitable.</comment>
