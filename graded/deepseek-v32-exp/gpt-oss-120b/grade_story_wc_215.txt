<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The recluse's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing the ruby line, leading to an earned renunciation. Motivation is clear and intensifies, though contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene. The final choice to honor the covenant is rooted in prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost legible in the "tear of molten amber" sealing the covenant. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, reinforcing the theme through pattern and image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details like "air hummed with a memory of honey" filtering through POV. The oasis and stained glass box constrain choices and charge the final image, altering tactics and reinforcing closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by the recluse's agency, deepening through contextual clues to reveal the covenant. The cost is unmistakable in the renewal of silence, foreclosing other paths with felt peace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions, such as the box's symbols and ghostly dance, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through implication, and the ending reweights prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that is "tranquily perceptive," reflected in selective attention to wind and symbols. Voice is controlled and poetic, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and legible, enhancing momentum without obscuring clarity in peak beats like the covenant's renewal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes post-apocalyptic, ghostly, and covenant elements with specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure effect is fully integrated.</comment>
