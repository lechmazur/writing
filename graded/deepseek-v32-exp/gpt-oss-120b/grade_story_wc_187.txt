<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and rooted in preemptive nostalgia, driving choices like examining shadows. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, though some feelings are told rather than shown. The shift to resolve is earned with visible cost, but minor abstraction in emotional expression prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong, building through sensory details and pattern. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with cost legible in the archivist's resolve. Orientation is clear early, and the crystal's role shapes tactics consistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the observatory and crystal constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, such as the fog affecting shadow lengths, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with conjecture and testing narrowing options. Cost is felt in the emotional shift from nostalgia to resolve, though the stakes remain somewhat abstract, limiting peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of collective memory emerges organically through images and actions, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting identity and experience, with subtext in the crystal's whisper and shadows avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control. Perceptual signature is character-specific, and elision (e.g., the hush) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied syntax, supporting momentum. No significant loops or artifacts, though occasional purple phrasing doesn't obscure clarity. Rhythm accelerates with scene needs, and closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of memory, geometry, and identity, with tropes transformed via specific details. The conceptual integrity is strong, and risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
