<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her actions with embodied interiority. The final choice to reclaim memories is earned, though contradictory impulses are not deeply explored in scene, slightly limiting the peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost under the accumulative lens—the steadying gravity and reclaimed memories reconfigure meaning. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the salt chamber's transformation charging the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with the salt chamber and gravity pockets constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Mara's POV, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative lens, from coffee grounds to chamber interaction, with cost legible in the reclaimed memories. The stake tightens meaningfully, though the peak choice lacks a sharp trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and loss emerges organically through images and events, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext in symbols like wildflowers avoids moralizing, and the final reconfiguration lingers with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature. Rhythm and diction control under pressure enhance clarity, and any elision (e.g., gravity mechanics) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm, avoiding loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, propelling the narrative without muddling peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravity pockets and memory retrieval is fresh and inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in lyrical style heightening stakes. Specificity in details like coffee grounds transforms the premise organically.</comment>
