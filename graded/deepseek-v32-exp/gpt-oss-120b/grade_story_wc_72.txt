<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The living statue's motivation is clear and drives the narrative, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure, reducing depth. Its serene purposefulness avoids stock phrasing, yet the final choice, while earned, lacks visible cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration under an Accumulative lens, with the garden's shift feeling inevitable and cost legible in the "sigh of brine." The lens holds consistently, and the structural weakness payoff reinforces causality without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with the garden's architecture (e.g., cracked arch) constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through the statue's perception, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes (nuance vs. certainty) escalate through accumulative revelations driven by the statue's agency, with cost visible in the garden's transformation. However, the escalation lacks a sharp tightening of options, relying on density increase rather than causal narrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from imagery and action, avoiding moralizing; the final image of "softened certainties" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates through motifs like the ampoule's glow and kelp patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with poetic rhythm and controlled perceptual signature. POV remains stable, and elision (e.g., memory threading) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, but slight overwriting in figurative language ("cascading revelations" repeated) mildly dulls momentum. No major artifacts or loops harm clarity, and sentence-level propulsion is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of underwater mysticism, telepathic statue, and thematic depth feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors the premise uniquely.</comment>
