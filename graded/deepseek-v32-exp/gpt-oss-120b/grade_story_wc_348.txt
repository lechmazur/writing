<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her symphonically minded trait filters perception, and the final bridge-building choice is earned through causal insight from the river foam. Contradictory impulses of grief and hope act in scene, and the resolution forecloses a path with visible cost ("loosened grief").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost ("loosened grief rise... as a gentle release") under a causal lens. Orientation is anchored early with who, where, and when. The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and the river foam constraint shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory detail filtered through Mara's POV. The braided ravine and river foam constrain choice by inspiring the polymer lattice, charging the final bridge image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details integrate with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of internal conflict between grief and purpose escalates through Mara's agency under the causal lens. The insight from foam patterns tightens options, leading to the bridge construction with legible cost. One meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of separation vs. connection emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the bridge as a conduit of light. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature ("symphonically minded"). Voice is consistent and poetic, with rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue, when present, is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythm. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, without loops or scaffold. No figurative muddle in peak beats, and closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of polymer science and natural inspiration, with a fresh angle on redemption. Emotional truth avoids templates, and risk-taking in blending disciplines heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
