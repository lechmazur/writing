<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's internal conflict between protection and freedom is embodied through concrete actions and micro-choices, such as singing the whale's hymn. Her final renunciation of the scrimshaw is earned by prior causality, with visible cost when the bone cracks and spirits rise. The "combative tenderness" motif avoids stock phrasing, though it recurs slightly often.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory density to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure. Mara's agency in singing and placing the scrimshaw leads to the island's revelation and her transformation. Cost is legible in the release of spirits and her "quiet resolve," foreclosing her old path without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (e.g., "phosphorescent algae," "wet wood") pressure choices and charge the final image. The sublittoral fringe and scrimshaw as micro-setting constrain Mara's actions, with the island's heart crystal reconfiguring meaning. POV bias filters description through Mara's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of freedom vs. protection escalates through Mara's agency under the Accumulative lens, notably when she sings and unlocks the crystal. Cost is unmistakable in the scrimshaw's destruction and the spirits' release, narrowing options and reweighting her resolve without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of freedom through self-acceptance emerges organically from events like the scrimshaw's unlocking and the whale's call, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in Mara's "quiet resolve" and the harbor's calm, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature, e.g., "seafoam clung to stone." Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in the hymn's rise "like a blade." No head-hopping; purposeful compression in the island's revelation is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with strong rhythm, but minor overwriting occurs in repeated motifs like "combative tenderness." No major loops or artifacts; clarity and propulsion remain high, especially in the closure beat. Information density is generally efficient, advancing story and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dock worker, whalebone scrimshaw, and disappearing island feels inevitable in hindsight, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure reconfigures meaning with emotional truth.</comment>
