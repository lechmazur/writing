<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eliam's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His meditative nature and interactions with Mara reveal interior conflict and growth, culminating in an earned change. However, slight passivity in early beats prevents a higher score, as his agency intensifies only after spectral guidance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with closure achieved through a resonant reconfiguration where Eliam's understanding of grief transforms into tangible art. Cost is legible in the final image of the singing stone, and orientation is clear within the first 120 words. The spectral mentorship integrates seamlessly without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details like "humid sigh" and "frosted glass" filtered through Eliam's POV. Setting actively shapes tactics, such as butterfly gatherings influencing stone arrangements, and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake in understanding collective grief escalates accumulatively through Mara's guidance and ritual practices, with protagonist agency driving key turns like mapping butterfly paths. Cost is felt in the transformation of grief into enduring beauty, though the conflict remains more internal than external.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like ribbons and poems, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to grief as a "flowing tapestry." Subtext operates through gesture and image, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material with emotional honesty and complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, featuring lyrical, meditative prose that reflects Eliam's inner world. Dialogue with Mara carries subtext and advances plot, and rhythmic control remains consistent under pressure, though minimal dialogue limits full voice distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with purposeful figurative language and no significant loops or scaffolds. Sentences advance story and atmosphere cohesively, though minor density in peak beats slightly hinders propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of gravestone carving, spectral mentorship, and collective grief feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details like the ribbon roll and butterfly migration. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional specificity anchors universals.</comment>
