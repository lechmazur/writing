<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Arlen's motivation to graft onto community is clear and drives the plot; her boldly sympathetic trait is embodied in actions like feeling the orchard's ache, though some emotions edge toward abstraction without full cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration as the arbor becomes a sanctuary, cost legible in the woven reeds and luminescent ache; accumulative lens holds with imagery building cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor constraining choices and charging the final image through sensory details like phosphorescent moss and fractured light.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of kinship emerges organically from the shared search and dedication, with the ending offering a non-literal answer through the expanding reed sculpture, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctively lyrical, with perceptual signature in phrases like "murmur of lost languages"; no head-hopping, and dialogue is minimal but natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops; figurative language like "webs of kinship" is pattern-taught and pays off, though slightly decorative in peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of marsh-reed sculptor and communal myth feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
