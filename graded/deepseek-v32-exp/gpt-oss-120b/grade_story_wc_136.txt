<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied emotion like "trembling certainty." Interiority is concrete, and the final role change to conduit is earned by prior causality. However, internal contradiction is minimal, leaning toward single-note determination.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages from clues to vault. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she becomes the conduit, with cost legible in her promise to return. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "cold mist" and "starlit vault" guiding choices. The vault and pavement cracks constrain actions and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details are filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under causal lens, following arrows and using the punch to unlock the door. Dominant stake (finding truths) tightens meaningfully, with cost in her new role as conduit. No coincidental resolutions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of mapping hidden truths emerges through events and images, not statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the ledger as a living archive. Subtext operates in implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "analytically artistic blend." Voice is poetic and consistent, modulating with pressure. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with vivid imagery, but minor overwriting like "analytically artistic" causes slight figurative muddle. No major artifacts or loops; clarity and momentum are maintained, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concept is fresh, synthesizing mapping with hidden truths in a non-obvious way. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the phantom punch. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
