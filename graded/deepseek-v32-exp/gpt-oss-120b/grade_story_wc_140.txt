<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied interiority and an earned change to purposeful keeper. Micro-choices under pressure reveal values, and the final renunciation of official identity for a new role has visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the final purpose realization. Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with the label's discovery and use driving coherent causality. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in "a purpose that no death certificate could erase."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the port city maze and tides pressuring choices. The poison bottle label as micro-setting constrains tactics and charges the final image, integrating seamlessly with action and POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes in discovering erased histories escalate under Accumulative lens through layering density and agency-driven choices. Cost is legible in the protagonist's transformation, with one meaningful tightening foreclosing the path of nameless drifting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and identity emerges organically through images and events, with subtext in the label's function and the final keeper role. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior fragments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and purposeful compression (e.g., layering fragments) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops or scaffold issues; figurative language is effective and clear, even in peak beats like the memory texture description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of erased histories and identity through specific, grounded details. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight, with no derivative echoes.</comment>
