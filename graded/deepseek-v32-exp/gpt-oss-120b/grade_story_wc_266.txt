<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and internal conflict shown through her persistence and the leash-breaking moment. Her final choice to step forward and reclaim courage is earned by the journey's causality, with visible cost in the map's revelation. The single POV is handled with depth, and micro-choices under pressure reveal her values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with Mira's internal change and the map's revelation, carrying felt cost under the accumulative/textural lens. The drive lens holds consistently, and the indirect route method shapes tactics and the final image. Orientation is clear early, and causality flows naturally from the inciting incident to the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like the pebble pier and ferry's lantern weaving atmosphere. The veiled ridgeway and cave environment constrain choices and charge the final image, as the ticket stamp and chest are integral to the closure. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details reflect Mira's POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding courage) is signaled early and escalates through Mira's agency under the accumulative lens, with the journey tightening pressure. The cost is legible in her use of the ticket and the map's revelation, foreclosing paths and reweighting options. Resolution is earned by her alteration, with no coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the courage seed and indirect routes, without direct statement. Subtext operates through the lullaby and star stamp, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the inner self map. Earned wisdom arises from particulars, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature in Mira's lyrical, sea-filtered perspective. Voice is consistent and rhythmic, enhancing emotional beats without head-hopping. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and pay off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "lantern glowed like a lullaby," without muddle or loops. No artifacts obscure causality or closure, and clarity is maintained under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines through a non-obvious synthesis of journey tropes, with specific elements like the star stamp and veiled ridgeway feeling organic. Emotional truth is specific to Mira's character, and risk-taking in the indirect method heightens stakes without gimmickry. The premise is transformed through grounded choices.</comment>
