<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Keeper's motivation to preserve wisdom is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied perception. His final understanding of purpose is earned by prior causality, though his agency is somewhat passive, reducing stakes. The half-mask and line-walking motif are integrated but could have deeper contradiction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the Keeper's new purpose felt as cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early. However, the prophet's arrival is a minor coincidence that complicates but doesn't resolve, slightly weakening causal linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory detail (e.g., "shimmering under a pale sun"), and the kinetic parapet constrains choices by conjuring clearings. The pavilion's murmuring charges the final image, and spatial choreography is coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving wisdom) is signaled early, and escalation occurs through the Keeper's consecration act under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in his devotion, but pressure is mild with no major tightening of options, relying on atmospheric deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images (e.g., "echo of wisdom"), with subtext in the desert's recording of resonance. The ending offers a non-literal answer through the Keeper's purpose, avoiding moralizing, though it leans slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful compression (e.g., "whisperfield calm"). No head-hopping or register drift, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, though minor redundancy in "echo of wisdom" phrases slightly reduces momentum. Closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements synthesize freshly with specificity (e.g., kinetic parapet), transforming familiar tropes through grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, but premise echoes common wisdom-keeper archetypes without full transformation.</comment>
