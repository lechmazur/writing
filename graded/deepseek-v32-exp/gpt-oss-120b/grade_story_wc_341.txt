<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and a earned renunciation; however, some cloud emotions border on stock phrasing, slightly reducing specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration under accumulative/textural lens, cost legible in the final image of light stitching the broken seam; orientation is clear early, and lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details and micro-setting (telescope) charge the final image; the gondola sways but constrains choices less actively, though it remains essential to atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency through cloud categorization, leading to a deepening stake with unmistakable cost in the recording of the comet; accumulative lens coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions, with subtext in the broken strings and light stitching; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable POV with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; poetic voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High information density with varied syntax and no loops; propulsion is clear, though minor overwriting in phrases like "quietly explosive" does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory and loss through specific details like emotion-based cloud classification; risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
