<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her experience with coral bleaching, driving her actions. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion like "feeling the same silence return." However, internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses, and the final realization, while earned, could have deeper micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—the coordinate discovery—reconfiguring past and future with cost legible in the coral's loss. Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages from tapping to echo. Orientation is clear early, and the structure transitions smoothly from routine to revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory details (e.g., "sea level monitoring station perched on the reclaimed pier"). The station and atlas page constrain choices and charge the final image. Specificity is purposeful, avoiding generic description, and spatial choreography remains coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering why paths disappear—escalates through protagonist agency, from data assembly to watermark revelation. Cost is felt in the coral's loss of direction. Under the causal lens, pressure tightens meaningfully with the echo discovery, foreclosing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the atlas page and tapping, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer about listening and memory. Subtext operates in silences and implications, enriching the narrative without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature filtering through Mara's observations. Rhythmic control is evident in the tapping motif, and elision is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but natural, and voice remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without scaffolds or loops. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "drifting moored." No artifacts obscure causality or closure; sentence-level propulsion supports the emotional arc.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of coral bleaching, rhythmic tapping, and cartographic revelation feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details transform familiar tropes through grounded choices in character and setting.</comment>
