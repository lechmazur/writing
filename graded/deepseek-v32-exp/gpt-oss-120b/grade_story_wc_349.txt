<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vendor's motivation is clear and profound, driving the narrative; interiority is concrete through embodied actions like counting voids and the final realization. The earned change—understanding that stories begin from quantified absence—is rooted in prior causality with visible cost as his quest dissolves.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the vendor's dissolved weight and the child's new story; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through density of imagery and pattern shifts. Orientation is clear early, and the map incision triggers a decisive reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices—shelves rearrange by quantifying absence, pressuring the vendor's actions. Sensory details (e.g., "pulsed like a shy sunrise") are selective and purposeful, charging the final image of moonlit droplets inking "origin."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding story origins) escalates under the Accumulative lens through vendor's agency—quantifying absence brightens moonlight, leading to the incision and pulse. Cost is felt in the quest's dissolution and the child's entry, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from events—silence and absence as story seeds—without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the vendor's realization and the child's action, reweighting prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is consistent (e.g., "reflected a pattern of broken sentences"). Elision (e.g., "quantifying absence") is taught and pays off at closure, and dialogue with the child is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with high information density and rhythmic variation; no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language ("moonlight fracturing into shards") is coherent and purposeful, though slight overwriting in peaks doesn't harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is a fresh synthesis—library floating on clouds, bottled moonlight—that feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity in details (e.g., "notebook made of vapor") anchors originality.</comment>
