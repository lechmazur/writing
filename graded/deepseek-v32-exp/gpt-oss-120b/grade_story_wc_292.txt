<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara's internal contradiction ("nervously confident") is embodied in scene, and her final choice to protect the nail is earned by prior causality with visible cost when she rallies the crew against the storm. Micro-choices under pressure, like descending the ladder, reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change with cost when Mara embeds the nail, reconfiguring her dread into resolve; causal drive lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from decoding journals to storm response. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image—the chamber beneath the turbine forces Mara's descent, and the storm pressures the climax. Sensory details like "iron and seaweed" are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens, from retrieving the nail to facing the vortex, with cost legible when she forfeits safety to protect the story. Dominant stake (honoring courage) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and redemption emerges through particulars like the nail and compass, offering a non-literal answer at closure without moralizing. Subtext operates in images, such as the nail glinting like a "captured heartbeat."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, map-focused diction ("coded stanzas," "wind charts") under pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., journal decoding) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, though minor overwriting occurs in stacked metaphors ("like a coat stitched from hope and dread"). No loops or artifacts obscure closure; sentence-level propulsion is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of weather station, map librarian, and copper nail feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in lyrical density that heightens stakes. Transformation of tropes through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
