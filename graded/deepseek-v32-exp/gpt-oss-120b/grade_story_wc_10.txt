<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied through physical remnants of trauma (calloused hands, scarf) and micro-choices under pressure; her motivation to rectify silence drives the narrative, and the final transformation is earned with visible cost as vibrations smooth jagged memories.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds coherently; orientation is immediate with who, where, and when anchored early; closure unit (Charged Poise) lands on-page with legible cost as music reconfigures silence into a beacon for survivors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory and tuning fork function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory details are vivid, selective, and POV-filtered, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rectifying silence) escalates under accumulative lens through protagonist agency; cost is unmistakable in the emotional mapping and closure, where music weaves past storms without erasure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence into music emerges organically from events and images; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the tapestry of sound, avoiding moralizing while honoring complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct with a lyrical perceptual signature; voice remains consistent under pressure, and purposeful elision (silence motif) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats, maintaining propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of capsize survivor with heat-mapping technology feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and transformation is grounded in character.</comment>
