<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Nabu's frugality and curiosity are consistently embodied, driving his actions from discovery to ritual. His motivation to bind cosmic will intensifies under pressure, culminating in a earned choice at the altar. However, internal conflict remains subtle rather than deeply contradictory, limiting peak emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the covenant's activation, cost legible in the "air shivered" and "gentle click." Causal lens holds tight from discovery to alignment, with the tile and timeframe constraining tactics. Orientation is immediate, and the ending reconfigures Nabu's practice with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the palace's "crumbling balconies" and "wind-chimed arches" filtering through Nabu's POV. The tile functions as micro-setting, constraining his choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, enhancing atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sealing the covenant escalates through Nabu's agency—sketching schematics, planetary alignment—culminating in the tile's activation. Cost is visible in the violet glow and renewed promise, tightening options under the causal lens. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of irony and devotion emerges organically from Nabu's frugality versus cosmic measures, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the covenant's success, reweighting prior material without abstraction. Subtext operates in the tile's whisper and dusky harmony.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Nabu's analytical yet wonder-driven mind. Prose rhythm modulates with pressure, and elision (e.g., "encrypted devotion") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong propulsion and varied syntax. Minor overwriting in repeated "empirically ironic" slightly dulls peak beats, but no loops or scaffolds obscure causality. Information density is high, and closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ancient astronomy and magic squares feels inevitable, transformed through Nabu's specific frugality and the palace setting. Risk-taking in poetic heightening pays off with stakes elevated without gimmickry. The covenant's sealing offers a non-obvious inflection.</comment>
