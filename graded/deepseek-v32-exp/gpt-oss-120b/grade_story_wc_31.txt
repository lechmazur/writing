<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot, but lacks deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses under pressure. His actions align with his vow, and the closure shows a decisive change, though the cost is not strongly felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with clear linkage from vow to discovery; closure is a decisive change with implied cost. Orientation is early and clear, but cost legibility is mild, preventing higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory-rich setting constrains choices and charges the final image; the sunken library and pier are integral to the plot. Details are purposeful and filtered through Eli's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation is agency-driven under causal lens, but cost is light and not fully visible on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs with the library discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with a resonant, non-literal ending that reweights prior material. Subtext in "hide behind truth" avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent. No head-hopping or dialogue issues, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with good rhythm and information density; no major artifacts or loops. Figurative language is consistent and supports clarity, though slight overwriting in peaks prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original premise of discovering sound's color is fresh and well-executed; specific details and synthesis feel inevitable. Risk-taking in poetic tone heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
