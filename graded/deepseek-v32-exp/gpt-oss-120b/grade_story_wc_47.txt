<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to graft new meaning onto old wounds is clear and consistent, driving her proactive choices like proffering stones and using the pendant. Interiority is embodied through sensory details (e.g., "protected vulnerability rise within her"), and her final transformation feels earned by prior causality. However, some emotional descriptions edge toward abstraction, slightly reducing concrete specificity under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, with patterns (drip sequence, honeyed hush) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the garden becomes a "living archive." Cost is legible in Lira's emotional shift and the garden's renewal. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the single-scene structure tightens meaningfully without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purpose-driven, with the data center's mossy decay constraining Lira's choices (e.g., stones in fissures guiding vine growth) and charging the final image. Sensory details (amber light, honey scent) are filtered through her POV, and the environment evolves causally with the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, stakes escalate through Lira's agency—proffering stones and awakening the interface—deepening the internal conflict of grief versus healing. Cost is felt in her vulnerability and the garden's transformation, narrowing options meaningfully. However, the escalation relies heavily on texture over causal turns, slightly limiting peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transforming pain into "gentle knowledge" emerges organically through images (pendant warming, code unfurling) and avoids moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the garden's hum, reweighting prior material without abstraction. Subtext operates in silences and implications, such as the viral confession's echo in the rewritten code.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature ("emerald silence," "honeyed hush") that modulates under emotional pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., sister's confession) is taught early and pays off in closure. Lyrical compression maintains clarity and rhythm without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, advancing story through concrete actions. Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language ("cathedral of rusted racks") is pattern-taught and coherent. Minor repetition of "honeyed hush" and protected vulnerability" slightly reduces momentum but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of tech and nature feels inevitable, with specific details (circuit vines, amber pendant as key) transforming tropes. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure image of "pain resting in honeyed hush" offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on healing.</comment>
