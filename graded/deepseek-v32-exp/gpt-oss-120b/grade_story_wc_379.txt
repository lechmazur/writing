<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to prove listening heals is clear and drives choices, but interiority occasionally relies on abstract phrasing like "cool memory press against her palm" rather than embodied emotion. Micro-choices under pressure, such as placing the locket to hear whispers, reveal values, but the resolution lacks strong contradictory impulses. The final exhibit creation is earned by prior causality, though cost feels slightly soft.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Mara's exhibit reconfigures community healing, with cost legible in "hearts lightened" and gratitude notes. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through story patterns. Orientation is clear early, and the locket's mystery drives causality without breaks, though the climax relies slightly on summarized outcomes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with sensory details like "wet stone and incense" filtering through Mara's POV. The courtyard constrains choice by serving as the site for listening and revelation, charging the final image. Economy is strong, but minor reliance on visual over other senses in peaks prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving listening heals—escalates through Mara's agency under the accumulative lens, as story density increases and reweights options. Cost is unmistakable in the fading city noise and community response. However, the escalation lacks a sharp tightening of options, relying on gradual accumulation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events like the whispers and letters, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the exhibit, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, though the core concept is occasionally stated directly, such as "listening truly healed."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, e.g., "sandstorm calm," and perceptual signature remains consistent under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but natural, as with the child's request. No head-hopping, though some phrases edge toward poetic abstraction without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with varied rhythm, but suffers from minor paraphrase loops (e.g., "locked mailbox mystery" repeated) and abstract metaphors like "metal’s cool memory" that slightly blur peak beats. Information density is high, though not flawless, and closure remains unharmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh synthesis of community healing through objects and listening, transforming tropes with specific details like the locket's whispers. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable. However, it echoes familiar themes of empathy, limiting uniqueness.</comment>
