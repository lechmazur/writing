<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The courier's motivation is clear and rooted in his absent mentor, with micro-choices under pressure, but interiority lacks deep contradiction and emotions could be more embodied; the final continuation feels earned but misses complex internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong with closure as Conceptual Repricing—the trail of light and legends reweights the premise with cost in transience; orientation is clear early, and causality is intact across encounters.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway and pendant are vivid, sensory-rich elements that charge the final image; setting filters through POV and supports tone, though it constrains choice less than it atmospherically envelops.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes of coaxing wonder escalate through courier's agency in encounters, with cost legible in the shepherd's spark and girl's discovery; under accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of extending encounters into legend emerges organically through events and images, not statement; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though "germinate" phrasing leans explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature; prose rhythm controls pressure well, and any elision is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is poetic and dense with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting and repetitive use of "germinate" create slight artifacts; clarity and momentum remain strong, and closure is unaffected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept of pendant-extending encounters is fresh synthesis, transforming tropes through specific details; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
