<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's affectionate skepticism is consistently embodied and drives her experiment; her internal conflict between doubt and hope is shown through concrete actions, and her final softened skepticism is earned by prior causality with visible cost when she feels the whisper of another mind.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly from static shock to neural resonance revelation; closure is a decisive change with felt cost in her surge of purpose and softened skepticism, anchored by clear orientation early in the scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices—the light painting studio and muscovite geode sliver are tactile resources that charge the final image of hidden pathways, with sensory details filtered through Mara's professional focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under causal lens via Mara's agency in devising the feedback loop; cost is legible when her skepticism is reconfigured and she commits to illuminating pathways, foreclosing her prior doubt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of skepticism transforming into willowglass hope emerges through particulars like the geode's resonance and somatic markers; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature blending scientific and poetic diction; voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping, and elision (e.g., telepathy pill recall) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, though minor figurative density in peaks like "willowglass hope" slightly mutes clarity; no loops or scaffolds harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of light painting, telepathy recall, and somatic markers feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric-scientific fusion heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure is charged by specificity.</comment>
