<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in scene, and the epiphany leans slightly abstract without full dramatization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost legible in Mira's shifted perspective and gratitude; the stone and ripples act as persistent constraints charging the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the prism atrium and pond constraining choice and charging the closure; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes in illuminating value escalate through density increase in imagery, driven by Mira's agency in attention; cost is felt in the reconfigured appreciation of the mundane.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the stone and ripples, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext operates through image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is poetically distinct with stable POV and perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure supports the accumulative drive without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of glazier, ripples, and light feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors universals.</comment>
