<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's dual allegiance is clear and motivates key choices, with interiority shown through her pattern recognition and conflict between carnival joy and dock workers' promises. However, the contradictory impulses are more summarized than dramatized in scene, limiting peak emotional embodiment. Her final balance feels earned but lacks deep on-page struggle in moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the community reorganizes and privatization is postponed, cost legible in "hopeful desperation." Causal lens holds tightly from Mira's actions to outcomes. Orientation is immediate, and the foundation stone chip persists as a constraint shaping the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The raft city and carnival are vividly rendered with sensory details that pressure choices, such as stall relocation. The foundation stone chip charges the final image in the glass case, and micro-setting elements like graffiti walls constrain tactics seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes against privatization escalate through Mira's graffiti network and reorganization moves, driven by her agency. Cost is unmistakable in the community's unified response and the phoenix mural's symbolism, narrowing options under causal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of community resilience emerges through particulars like the graffiti code and phoenix symbol, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in encoded messages and dual allegiance enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, filtering perception through Mira's orderly intuitive mind. No head-hopping; elision in graffiti mechanics is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with varied sentence structures, advancing story without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "hopeful desperation that felt like a tide turning back" is purposeful and clear, supporting momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of raft city, culture shock absorber, and graffiti resistance feels fresh and inevitable. Specific details like the foundation stone chip transform tropes through grounded choices, with risk-taking in tone and structure heightening stakes.</comment>
