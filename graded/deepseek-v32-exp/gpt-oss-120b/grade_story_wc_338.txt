<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Character's methodical curiosity is consistently shown through concrete actions like comparing shadows and tracing glyphs, driving the narrative. Interiority is embodied in micro-choices under pressure, such as aligning the projector, with the final realization earned by prior causality. However, slight lack of internal contradiction or flawed struggle limits higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual repricing—the map tear as portal—and felt cost in the chapel's muted chorus, under a coherent accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the structure tightens through pattern density without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting vividly constrains choices, such as the fresco vault housing the projector and the ancient henge pulsing in response, charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the protagonist's professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist's agency in comparing footage and aligning projections, narrowing options under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the restored rhythm and emotional opening, though escalation is more deepening than dramatic reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of interpreting silence with empathy emerges through particulars like the map tear and video alignment, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and images, such as the sighed-open doors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice maintains a distinct perceptual signature with poetic rhythm and controlled compression, stable in single POV. Elision, like the whispered chapel's invitation, is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied syntax, with purposeful figurative language enhancing atmosphere. Minor density in peak beats, like "pulse with mute stories," slightly risks overwriting but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of map framing, silent footage, and metaphysical boundaries feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific detail. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
