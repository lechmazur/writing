<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, with patient traits embodied in actions like decoding knots. Interiority is concrete, but lacks contradictory impulses; final commitment is earned through prior causality with subtle cost in the weight of centuries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with felt cost in the weight on shoulders; accumulative/textural lens holds strong, and orientation is clear early. Persistent constraint of patience shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with sensory details like "slick with sea spray" influencing choices; the rope and fulgurite glass constrain actions and charge the final image, integrating deeply with the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes of preserving knowledge escalate through protagonist's agency in decoding knots, leading to a cost legible in the weight felt; under accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully without external conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of patience and preservation emerges organically from images and actions, not statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the promise to sow knowledge, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure, and purposeful elision in decoding pays off at closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, and closure image remains clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable, with fresh angle on preservation tropes; risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure reweights prior material.</comment>
