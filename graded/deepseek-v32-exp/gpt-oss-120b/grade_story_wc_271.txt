<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Protagonist's trauma and resilience are embodied through somatic markers and micro-choices; final resolution to plant hope is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the photograph handling. Contradictory impulses of grief and stillness act simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with sensory details building to a Charged Poise closure; cost is legible in the final image of the photograph warming against her chest. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the arboretum setting charges the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Arboretum setting constrains choices and charges the final image; sensory details like pine needles and wind chimes are selective and purposeful, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens, with cost felt in her decision to freeze grief and plant hope; one meaningful tightening occurs as she smooths the photograph, foreclosing passive mourning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges organically from particulars like the pearl of stillness and scarred sapling; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., "partner she never knew") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language like "pearl of stillness" is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma recovery through somatic markers and arboretum setting; risk-taking in quiet resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
