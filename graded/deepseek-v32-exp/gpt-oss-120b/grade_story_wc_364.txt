<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The blacksmith's meekness and determination are consistently embodied through micro-choices like bartering a memory and forging the blade, with interior contradiction (hope/doubt) shown in scene. His transformation to a sentinel is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the scar memory forfeited.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (from meek to resilient sentinel) with felt cost in the bartered memory and the blade's impact, under a causal lens that holds throughout. The mine shafts and silk constrain tactics, and orientation is clear early with planet and workshop anchors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (orchard planet, floating arches, azure glyphs) and pressures choices—mine shafts enable the quest, the arch provides the forge. The silk and blade recur to charge the final image, constraining actions and deepening resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resilience) escalates through the blacksmith's agency: venturing into mines, bartering memory, obtaining silk, forging blade. Cost is legible in the memory loss and the blade's rebuilding effect, tightening options under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of bartered awakenings emerges implicitly through the silk's use and the blade's creation, with subtext in the memory trade-off. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (rebuilding from rubble) without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, focused prose that reflects the blacksmith's reverence and resolve. Minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven when villagers gather, and elision (e.g., map details) is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("like a comet," "wind caught in cotton") is coherent and heightens pressure, and sentence propulsion supports the causal drive to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes unique elements (orchard planet, bartered awakenings) with specificity, transforming tropes through the blacksmith's grounded journey. Risk-taking in lyrical world-building pays off with emotional truth and inevitability in hindsight.</comment>
