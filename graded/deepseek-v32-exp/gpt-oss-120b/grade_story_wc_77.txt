<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear but interiority relies on abstract descriptors like "lingering luminance" rather than embodied emotion; her final choice to whisper "vanish" is earned, but emotional depth is limited by diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost—Mara must carry the luminance forever—under a causal drive lens; orientation is clear early, and the plot coheres with decisive change from her actions, though some late elements feel slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices—the funhouse mirrors and carousel horse charge the climax; sensory details like "taste of copper and rot" are purposeful and enhance atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under causal lens, from swallowing the clasp to using dream notes; cost is legible as she bears the luminance forever, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action—fear's weakness is its own reflection—without moralizing; subtext in the cursed rose and final bargain offers resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic diction; no head-hopping, and elision (e.g., dream dictionary mechanics) is taught and paid off, though minor register consistency issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic but overwritten in peaks—e.g., "lingering luminance" repeated—with some mixed metaphors; momentum persists, though artifacts slightly dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of carnival horror and psychological fear feels fresh; tropes are transformed through specific details like the cursed clasp, and risk-taking in style heightens stakes.</comment>
