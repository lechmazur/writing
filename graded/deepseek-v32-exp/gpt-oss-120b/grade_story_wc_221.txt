<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., stepping closer to the ripple) revealing values. Interiority is concrete and embodied, though some emotional summary slightly reduces immediacy. Final resolve is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the promise to navigate by true north.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the resolve to explore. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with pattern taught early. The vision and compass alignment provide a meaningful tightening that reweights options without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with the time dilation observation deck constraining choices (e.g., enabling the vision) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV bias, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with the vision and compass alignment deepening stakes and narrowing options. Cost is legible in the resolve to continue exploration, though the shift from confusion is somewhat abrupt but earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with the compass and ritual offering a resonant, non-literal answer to loss and hope. Subtext operates through implication (e.g., vibrating compass), avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature biased toward memory and symbolism. Voice is poetic and controlled under pressure, with purposeful elision (e.g., time dilation) taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, but risks overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "minutes stretched like taffy"). No major loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies naturally, though minor coherence issues in peak beats prevent higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic and time dilation elements, transformed through specific details like the family ritual. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
