<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's centuries of weight and decisive action under pressure are embodied, with micro-choices like lifting the lantern revealing her hierarchy of values. The storm herald's shadowed elation adds paradoxical depth, though some abstract phrasing slightly dilutes peak emotional beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—world reborn in shadowed brilliance—under a causal lens, cost legible in the "joyous melancholy." Orientation is immediate; the ritual's cause-effect linkage tightens options meaningfully, and the prism constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse and lantern wick function as micro-settings that constrain choices (e.g., redirecting the beam) and charge the final image with emerald fire. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven through action without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from waiting to steering the storm, with cost unmistakable in the shadowed elation. The dominant stake (shaping a new dawn) tightens through a meaningful turn that forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the serpent of light and dissolving newspaper, offering a non-literal answer to rebirth through ancient shadows. Subtext operates in gesture and image, avoiding moralizing while resonating beyond the plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and filtered through Mira's perceptual signature, with poetic rhythm control under pressure. Minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven; elision (e.g., the newspaper) is taught and pays off, though minor abstraction in peak beats slightly blurs immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language serving purpose without muddle. No loops or scaffolds obscure causality; however, slight overwriting in phrases like "phosphorescent pulse" mildly reduces concision in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes (lighthouse keeper, storm herald) with fresh, non-obvious angles—turning the beam inward—that feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors emotional truth.</comment>
