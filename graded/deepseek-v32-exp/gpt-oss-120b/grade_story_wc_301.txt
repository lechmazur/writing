<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied emotion, with motivation clear and intensifying under pressure. The final choice of self-forgiveness is earned through prior causality, though contradictory impulses are not fully dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the whisper to the stones and the raw solace. Orientation is clear early, and structure coheres with a single scene transition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (graffiti leads to tunnel) and charges the final image (river as witness). Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, with the station and river deeply integrated into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, from finding graffiti to playing the accordion, with cost visible in the acceptance of raw solace. Stakes are clear and tighten meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of self-forgiveness emerges organically through images and events, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer. The graffiti line slightly echoes the theme but remains integrated without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature and rhythmic control. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., map references) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and supports pressure, and the closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (river chronicler, accordion, graffiti) feels inevitable and fresh. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the premise is transformed through specificity.</comment>
