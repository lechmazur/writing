<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistently drives actions, with embodied interiority (e.g., "mind, still fogged" and scar examination). The final closure is earned through prior causality, though internal contradiction is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (understanding wounds hold hope) and felt cost under accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and lens holds without ambiguity, with the hourglass ritual charging the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the tower, tunnel, and hourglass constraining choices and charging the closure. Sensory details (e.g., "damp moss," "molten glass" light) are selectively integrated through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist's agency in aligning hourglass with coffee rings, narrowing options under accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the final realization, though escalation is subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events (scars, displaced miracles), with a non-literal, resonant answer at the end. Subtext in plant whispers and coffee rings avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic perceptual signature (e.g., "meteor hush"). Rhythmic control under pressure and purposeful elision (e.g., plant telepathy) enhance coherence without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, but minor overwriting (e.g., repeated "meteor hush") doesn't harm closure. No major artifacts or loops; rhythm supports accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of concepts (telepathic plants, displaced miracles) feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style heightening stakes. Specificity in scar stories and hourglass ritual avoids derivative premises.</comment>
