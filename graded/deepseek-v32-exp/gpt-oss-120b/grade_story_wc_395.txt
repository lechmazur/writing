<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lia's motivation evolves credibly from abstract curiosity to urgent purpose, embodied in micro-choices like fabricating the lie. Her internal surge of purpose feels earned, though peak emotions occasionally edge toward diagnostic language. The final stance crystallization—transforming absence into presence—is scaled to the story's length with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing via the crew's message, reweighting absence as presence with undeniable cost. Causal linkages hold tightly from hypothesis to discovery, and the numbers as a persistent constraint shape tactics. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph, and the drive lens remains coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The archive setting constrains choices, guiding Lia to the hidden server farm, and the recurring numbers charge the final image. Sensory details like "amber light" and "static air" are selective and purposeful, filtered through Lia's professional attention. The micro-setting of the terminal rack directly enables the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Lia's agency under the causal lens, from tracing metadata to posting the lie, which triggers algorithm responses and narrows options. The cost is legible in her transformed purpose and the resurrected logs. One meaningful tightening—the lie's ripple effect—forecloses passive observation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of digital memory and human absence, culminating in the crew's message that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates through images like "phantom breadcrumb" and the final silence-to-presence shift. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature ("hum of forgotten data like distant choir"). Syntax and rhythm control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity, though some lyrical phrases may slightly prioritize texture over momentum. No head-hopping or unmotivated elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety, with figurative language like "phantom breadcrumb" serving clarity. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; sentences advance story and atmosphere cohesively. The final image lands with precision, and line-level craft supports propulsion throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of digital archaeology, sci-fi mystery, and poetic realism feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the checksum numbers and social network metadata. Risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise commits fully.</comment>
