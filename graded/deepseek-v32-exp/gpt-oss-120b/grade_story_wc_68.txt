<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with "agonize" dramatizing internal conflict; final choice to preserve both narratives is earned through methodical sifting and cog sync, with cost in relinquishing singular truth. Micro-choices like placing the cog reveal hierarchy of values. No diagnostic label-speak; emotionally embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing under accumulative/textural lens, with cost legible in "agonizing over a single truth is less fruitful." Orientation anchored early; drive lens holds without ambiguity. Persistent constraint of sedimentary layers and cog shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting (sewer, ruins) pressures choices via silt and cog, charging the final image with the cog's tick. Sensory details (bioluminescent algae, click of brass) are selective and POV-filtered. Micro-setting of sedimentary layers constrains discovery and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (which narrative to champion) escalates under accumulative lens through density of layers and cog sync, driven by protagonist's agency. Cost is felt in agonizing and decision to document both, narrowing options. No coincidence; resolution earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of coexisting narratives emerges from particulars (cog, layers) without moralizing; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via "chorus of truths." Subtext operates in image of cog ticking; epiphany earned through concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV stable and distinct with perceptual signature ("abrasive calm," rhythmic prose). Voice modulates under pressure; elision taught and paid off in closure. No head-hopping; diction matches philosophical character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language purposeful (e.g., "click of brass cut through quiet decay"); clarity maintained in peak beats. Syntax supports accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic philosophy and engineering; premise transformed through specific details (chronometer cog, sedimentary layers). Risk-taking in quiet, reflective closure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
