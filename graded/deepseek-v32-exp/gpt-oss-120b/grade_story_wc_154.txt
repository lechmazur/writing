<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The translator's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing the notes and using the coral. However, the "shrewdly innocent" attribute is more told than shown, slightly reducing depth. Interiority is concrete and embodied, but the trait doesn't fully constrain choices with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with mutual recognition and the coral's vibration, carrying felt cost in the "lotus-hearted ache." The accumulative/textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early. No causality breaks; the ending reweights meaning with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the mist-clad atrium and twilight atmosphere filtering through POV. The brain coral and child's cast function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image, integrating sensory detail with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is driven by the translator's agency in decrypting notes and using the coral, leading to a deepening of stakes. Cost is legible in the "lotus-hearted ache," but it's subtle, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges organically through motifs like the coral and cast, with subtext in gestures and images. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the final image of shared strength.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature. Rhythmic control is strong under pressure, though minor overwriting in figurative phrases slightly reduces clarity. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with purposeful figurative language. No major artifacts or loops, but occasional dense imagery in peak beats slightly impedes momentum without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of healing trauma through specific elements like the coral and cast, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the concept is fully committed.</comment>
