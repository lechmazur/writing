<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Arlen's motivation is clear and rooted in past trauma, with embodied emotions like eyes stinging and micro-choices under pressure. His final decision to catalog scents is earned by prior causality, though minor abstraction in emotional description prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in Arlen's grief and commitment, under an accumulative/textural lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) is legible on the page with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting is vividly specific and sensory, constraining choices and charging the final image with phosphorescent vines and extinct flora. Details are purposefully woven into action, enhancing atmosphere without generic elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens occurs through the vapor revealing memories, leading to Arlen's emotional response and decision. Agency is clear, with cost legible in his tears and renewed purpose, though the stakes are internal rather than external.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and imagery, with subtext in crystal shadows and extinct plants. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer on grief and memory without moralizing, earned through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice that reflects Arlen's perception. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision (e.g., ultraviolet revealing) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density, varied rhythm, and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, enhancing momentum without obscuring clarity, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of memory, scent, and grief through specific details like the lantern broker and extinct plants. The non-obvious angle feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in lyrical style that heightens stakes.</comment>
