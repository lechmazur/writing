<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to understand "the texture of borrowed time" is clear and rooted in her role, with embodied contradiction in "furiously tranquil." Her final realization is earned through prior causality, and micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the final image of "cool, living water flowing over ancient, unmoving stone." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pattern breaks and cadence shifts reinforcing stakes. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The icebound atrium and acorn cap constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory detail selective and purposeful (e.g., "starlight captive in a billion frozen fractals"). Spatial choreography is coherent, and setting evolves causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving the legacy) is signaled early; escalation under the Accumulative lens occurs through density increase in chaotic energy, driven by Elara's agency to decrease entropy. Cost is legible in her effort and the final "wild serenity."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of legacy and time emerges through particulars like the acorn cap and vortex, with subtext in imagery. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the final realization of "borrowed time."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful compression in lyric mode is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, though slightly dense in peaks. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept of decreasing entropy to mend a pocket reality is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Specific details like the acorn cap as anchor transform tropes, and risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
