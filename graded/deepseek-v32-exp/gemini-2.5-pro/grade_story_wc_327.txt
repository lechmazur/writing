<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation to translate texture into sound is clear and consistently drives higher-stakes choices, embodied in micro-choices like aligning the diamond. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion (e.g., "My skin... felt the world more than saw it"). The final choice is earned by prior causality, and internal conflict between texture and sound beliefs adds depth. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with cost: the echoes collapse into silence, then a new sound blooms, reconfiguring the Old Tongue's meaning under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and causality is tight, with Kaelen's actions leading to the climax. The persistent constraint of echoes shapes tactics, and cost is legible in "the endless echoes collapsed into nothing."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details like "towers of bone" and "canyon's roar" integrated into action. The bone tower constrains choice and charges the final image, as Kaelen uses it to decipher texture. Sensory hierarchy reflects POV bias, and spatial choreography is coherent. No generic placeholder or momentum stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving the Old Tongue) is signaled early and escalates through Kaelen's agency under the Accumulative lens, culminating in the diamond alignment. Cost is legible in the silence and new sound, foreclosing the path of chaotic echoes. Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully, with no coincidence or static conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, exploring meaning in texture versus sound, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the new sound from the bone tower. Subtext operates in implication (e.g., starlings as living syntax), and earned wisdom arises from Kaelen's struggle. No moralizing or thematic drift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature, focusing on texture and feeling. Voice is poetic and consistent, with rhythmic control under pressure (e.g., "a fluid, shifting tapestry"). No head-hopping or register mismatch; elision is purposeful, and diction matches Kaelen's worldview. No dialogue present, so not evaluated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or overwriting; figurative language is purposeful (e.g., "a river of black ink"). Clarity and concision maintain momentum, and syntax supports emotional beats. No artifacts or muddle in peak moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of echoes, texture translation, and starlings' murmuration, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Tropes like the "last storyteller" are transformed through specific grounded choices. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
