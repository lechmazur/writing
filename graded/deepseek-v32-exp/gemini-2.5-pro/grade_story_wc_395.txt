<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. Her "brightly attentive" nature is shown through concrete actions like noticing patterns, and her lie to Kael reveals internal conflict. The final choice to forward the data is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the risk taken.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight causal chain under the Causal lens, with orientation anchored early. Closure is a Decisive Change as Elara forwards Julian's data, with felt cost in the revelation and risk. The numbers as a key shape tactics, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered as a "silent city" of archives, with sensory details like "server noise" that reflect POV. The Seraphim-7 patch constrains choice and charges the final image, integrating environment into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled around finding Julian's profile, escalating through Elara's agency as she decodes numbers and lies to Kael. Cost is legible in the risk and revelation, with one meaningful tightening under the Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and corporate secrecy emerges through events and images like the numbers and patch, without moralizing.
