<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion ("breath caught in his throat") and micro-choices under pressure. His final action (prodding the speck) is earned by prior causality, and his transformation feels credible with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (arbor's transformation) and resonant reconfiguration (Elian's personal shift), felt cost in "tremor ran through the Great Root." Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with prophecy and leaf patterns driving causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail ("ashen skyborne arbor," "brittle, silver leaves"). The environment constrains choices (monuments, moonstone speck) and charges the final image, reinforcing the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding the message to restore the arbor) escalates through Elian's agency under the Accumulative lens, culminating in the prodding action with unmistakable cost (transformation). Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of transformation through small acts emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("monumental power of the very, very small") without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, descriptive voice that modulates with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; diction and rhythm control enhance pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is elegant and dense with vivid imagery, varying sentence rhythms, and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats like the prodding scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, transforming tropes through grounded details (seed sorter in a skyborne arbor). Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes, and the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
