<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion in the thread-handling and projection; his final realization about healing is earned through specific, dramatized experiences, though lacks strong contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the 'deeper silence' and changed perception; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density increase in the projection scene, with the thread as persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting vividly pressures choices—the garden's decay mirrors internal states, and the thread charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Kaelen's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kaelen's agency in projection, deepening stakes under Accumulative lens; cost is visible in the sharpened chill and silence, reweighting the dominant stake of understanding healing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Elara's weaving and Kaelen's realization; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer on healing as containment, without moralizing, through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with lyrical prose reflecting Kaelen's perceptual signature; no head-hopping, and elision in projection is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats like the projection sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of obituaries for the living and explained absences feels inevitable; risk-taking in projection method heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and premise is transformed through specific detail.</comment>
