<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her past as a crisis actor, with embodied emotions like "tears she had choked down" showing internal conflict. Her final choice to display raw grief is earned by prior causality, and micro-choices under pressure reveal her values. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; characterization is consistently specific and drives the narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (the door unlocking) and felt cost (Regent's flinch, Elara's tears). Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages from Elara's actions to the resolution. Orientation is clear early, and the chessboard as a persistent constraint shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the whispering gallery and obsidian chessboard constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Elara's POV, such as the acoustics magnifying doubt. The environment pressures tactics and reinforces theme without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freedom vs. control) escalates through Elara's agency, driven by her walking code and emotional display. Cost is legible in her tears and the Regent's realization, narrowing options under the causal lens. Pressure tightens meaningfully without coincidence, and the resolution forecloses paths with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the chessboard and walking patterns, without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "UNBIND." Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality, and thematic complexity lingers through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with Elara's perceptual signature shaping narration. Voice is controlled under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., coded walking) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction and rhythm are consistent and heighten tension without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is precise and purposeful, as in "a click that echoed like a breaking bone." Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere seamlessly, and closure is undulled by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Story synthesizes elements freshly, with the crisis actor premise and walking code feeling organic and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific details, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth and originality arise from character-driven choices.</comment>
