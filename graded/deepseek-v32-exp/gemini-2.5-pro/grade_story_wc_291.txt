<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elias's prosopagnosia and methodical nature are concretely embodied, driving micro-choices under pressure; his empathy awakening is earned through the ritual, with visible cost in the final ache.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure via conceptual repricing (the scratch unifying opposites) lands on-page with felt cost, and his condition persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Quarry and mist constrain choice (as canvas) and charge the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, mirroring internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes (awakening empathy) escalate through Elias's agency under accumulative lens; cost is legible in the sorrow pang after the scratch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of absence defining presence emerges through images and juxtaposition; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single PVO stable with distinct perceptual signature; lyrical prose controls rhythm under pressure, and elision (e.g., victim's face) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high density and varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts, and figurative language ("fading bruise") coheres without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes face-blindness and cold case with specificity; risk-taking in abstract climax heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
