<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to quantify grief is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion shown through actions like tracing the mosaic. His internal conflict is dramatized, and the final peace is earned by the ritual, with visible cost in the "profound and stable understanding." No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with the lattice of light reconfiguring Elian's understanding of loss. Cost is legible in "peace that was not happiness." Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details like "damp earth" and "luminous ghost-pale apple trees" filtering through Elian's POV. The cavern orchard and mosaic stepping stones constrain choice and charge the final image, essential to the ritual's outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal—understanding grief—escalating through Elian's agency in the ritual. A meaningful deepening occurs as the lattice reveals the structure of his loss, with cost legible in the reconfiguration of his pain. Coherent under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief's mathematical structure emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in the ritual and lattice. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "living theorem," avoiding moralizing and earning wisdom through specific experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature reflecting Elian's mindset. Voice controls rhythm and diction under pressure, such as in the climax, with no head-hopping or register drift. Elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and lyrical, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and atmosphere seamlessly. Read-aloud test passes, and closure is undimmed by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept of mapping grief mathematically is fresh and non-obvious, synthesized organically with character and setting. Risk-taking in poetic approach heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
