<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure, such as touching the bead triggering memories. His motivation intensifies credibly from curiosity to understanding, compelling higher stakes. The final renunciation and acceptance of the debt are earned by prior causality, with visible cost in Lyra's dissolution. However, his agency is somewhat passive, relying on the ghost's actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change: knowledge transference and Lyra's release, with felt cost in her dissolution. The causal lens holds tightly, with because/therefore linkages from the bead to memories to climax. Orientation is clear within 120 words, anchoring who, where, and when. The persistent constraint of the debt shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse constrains choices and charges the final image, with the Night Phalaenopsis bloom as a key resource. Sensory details are vivid and selective, reflecting POV bias, such as "toxic perfumes" and "acid dew." The setting evolves causally with the ghost's influence, deepening atmosphere. Micro-setting elements like the bead and plants are integral to pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, with the bead and ghost appearances tightening options and changing knowledge. The dominant stake of debt repayment deepens through resonant awakenings, leading to a climax with legible cost in Lyra's sacrifice. One meaningful tightening occurs as memories bleed in, foreclosing other paths. However, Elian's passivity slightly undermines full agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of debt and legacy emerges organically through events and images, not statement, with subtext in the "lovingly venomous" care. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through transference, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and earned through specifics like the bead and orchid. Complexity embraces mournful elation without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in Elian's lyrical, observant voice. Prose texture is controlled, with rhythmic variation and purposeful compression, such as in the climax. No head-hopping or unmotivated elision; diction remains character-consistent. Experimental tolerance is high, with patterned imagery taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Rhythm varies naturally, avoiding template cadence, though minor overwriting occurs in phrases like "lovingly venomous." No major artifacts or loops; figurative language is coherent and supports pressure. Closure image is sharp and undulled by line-level issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes ghost lore and alchemy with fresh, specific details, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices in character and stakes, such as the debt repayment across lifetimes. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens coherence without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, with a bold closure.</comment>
