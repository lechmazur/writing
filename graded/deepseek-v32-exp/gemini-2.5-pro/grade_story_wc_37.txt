<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistently drives her actions, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to sing the Canticle is earned by her accumulated efforts, though her internal conflict remains somewhat straightforward without deep contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the dawn's creation, reconfiguring the realm's fate under an accumulative/textural lens. Cost is legible in the Lumina tree's renewal and Elara's healed memory, with the persistent constraint of her shattered memory shaping tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly specific and sensory, constraining choices by its fading state and charging the final image through the mica window. Details are purposefully integrated into action, such as the phosphorescent motes weaving the dawn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled, and escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Elara's agency in gathering song fragments. The cost of her effort is felt in the climax, though the tension lacks a secondary layer of conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer to renewal and memory. Subtext operates in the song's magic knitting communities, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Elara's fractured mind. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, though the prose occasionally leans into decorative density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is highly crafted with varied rhythm and clear propulsion, avoiding loops or scaffolds. Figurative language, such as "voice thin as a spider’s thread," serves the climax without muddle, and information density is high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes memory, magic, and ecology in a fresh, inevitable way, with risk-taking in the accumulative structure. Specific details like the Petal-Moths and Shadow-Vine deepen the world without gimmickry.</comment>
