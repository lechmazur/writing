<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion (e.g., "knot of dread") and micro-choices that reveal her values. Her final decision to interfere is earned by prior causality, showing a credible endurance with visible cost in her exhaustion. However, minor diagnostic label-speak ("cautiously hopeful flicker") slightly reduces peak beat impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly, with orientation anchored early. Closure is a Decisive Change—her intervention alters the crowd's behavior—and cost is legible in her exhausted ache and the ongoing threat. The persistent constraint of cosmic tricksters adapting shapes tactics, ensuring coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details (e.g., "ozone and dust") filtering through Elara's POV. The radio station and tools like the waveform generator constrain choices and charge the final image, integrating environment into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens, from detecting signals to deploying the counter-frequency. Dominant stake (societal unity) tightens meaningfully, with cost unmistakable in the crowd's shift and her exhaustion. No coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as the "hum" representing quiet resistance against manipulation. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though it leans slightly toward abstraction in the final lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature blending technical and poetic diction. Voice remains coherent under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., signal details) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language ("dusty bubble of analog warmth") is consistent and purposeful, though minor register elevation in peak beats ("ethereal grit") slightly reduces immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes cosmic influence and social commentary with originality, transformed through specific details like subsonic frequencies. Risk-taking in structure and tone heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
