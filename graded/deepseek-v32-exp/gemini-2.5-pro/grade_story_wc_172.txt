<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices. His final act of penance is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the dissolution of the egg. The contradiction between his amoral actions and sentimental flaw drives the narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows an accumulative/textural lens, building to a resonant reconfiguration with on-page cost in the egg's dissolution and Elias's hollow resonance.
