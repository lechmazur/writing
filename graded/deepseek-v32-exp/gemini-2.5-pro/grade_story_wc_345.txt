<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Characters show clear motivations and micro-choices under pressure, with Elara's faith and Kaelen's cynicism creating relational tension. The ghost's altruism is consistent, and the final collective effort feels earned, though some secondary characters lack depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from messages to discoveries. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost in the climb effort and the ghost's sacrifice, landing on-page with the resonant hum clearing the path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with "dust of Xylos" and floating arches, constraining choices like the climb. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, charging the final image as the bell tunes the planet.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of survival escalates through protagonist agency following messages, culminating in the impossible climb. Cost is legible in the desperate hoist and resonant payoff, narrowing options under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of hope and collective effort emerges through events like the bell's discovery and use, not statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the ghost's "Go home," avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable and filtered through Elara's perception, with distinct voice in descriptions like "dust of Xylos tasted like rust and regret." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, advancing plot without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and variation, with high information density and no major artifacts. Minor clichés like "rust and regret" are offset by vivid lines such as "harmonic hum pulsed from the arch."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Concept of a ghost guiding with chalk messages is fresh, and the bell as a tuning fork transforms tropes through specific logic. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
