<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Anya's characterization is deeply embodied with somatic markers of trauma and credible micro-choices under pressure. Her final endurance and return to watering the pine constitute an earned stasis, with cost legible in her aching joints and hand over the photograph. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains concrete and particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in the physical tension release and reaffirmed commitment. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory density to the grounding technique. Orientation is clear within 120 words; the persistent constraint of trauma shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated, with the arboretum and Wollemi pine constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory details (soil grit, pine resin) are selective and purposeful, reflecting POV bias. The seaside cliff and muted surf mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, as the drone shadow triggers a PTSD episode and her grounding response. Dominant stake (internal resilience vs. trauma) tightens through somatic intensity, with cost visible in her paralysis and recovery. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: trauma and resilience are reconfigured through the pine's antiquity and the "pearl of stillness" technique. Subtext operates in gestures like hand over the photograph. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature that modulates under stress (e.g., "high, thin whine"). No head-hopping; prose rhythm controls pressure without obscuring clarity. Elision in trauma response is taught and paid off in grounding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language ("ice bloomed in her stomach") is coherent and voice-motivated. Rhythm accelerates and breathes with scene needs, sustaining momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of PTSD, living fossils, and arboretum setting feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Emotional specificity avoids cliché, and risk-taking in internal conflict heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is transformed through grounded detail.</comment>
