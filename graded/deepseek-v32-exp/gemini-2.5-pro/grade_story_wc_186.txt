<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority such as "hands shaking" and a wavering resolve that reveals internal conflict. His retrocognitive trait is consistently used to drive choices, and the final action to place the shard is earned by prior causality, foreclosing the path of silence with visible cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; micro-choices under stress reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orientation is anchored within 120 words, and the causal drive lens holds from visions to alignment, culminating in a decisive change with cost legible in the "absolute silence" before the vibration. Closure is on-page as the beacon emits light, reconfiguring the stakes with a felt cost against loneliness. The structure is single-scene with no transitions, and the star-map premise is paid off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "bruised twilight" and the glass pavilion constraining choices as an observatory. The prism as a micro-setting object charges the final image, and sensory selection reflects Elian's urgency. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details are filtered through his POV bias, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rekindling the beacon escalates under the causal lens through celestial alignment and Elian's wavering resolve, with agency in his decision to place the shard. Cost is unmistakable in overcoming the "suffocating void" of loneliness. The tightening forecloses the option of silence, and the resolution is earned by protagonist alteration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of meaning in chaos emerges through events and images like the "shard of hush" and "thistle-blown hope," without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the pulsing light reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and silence, and the concept integrates seamlessly with character struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in Elian's obsessive, retrospective voice. Prose rhythm varies purposefully, such as in the climax where syntax accelerates pressure. No head-hopping or unmotivated elision; the voice remains coherent under stress with patterned diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence openings and rhythmic control. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; lines advance story and atmosphere efficiently. Read-aloud ear test passes, and closure image is sharp without redundancy or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of retrocognition, celestial mapping, and post-apocalyptic hope, with tropes transformed through specific details like the star-lane fragmentation. The emotional truth of loneliness and the non-obvious climax heighten stakes without gimmickry. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in the quiet ending pays off.</comment>
