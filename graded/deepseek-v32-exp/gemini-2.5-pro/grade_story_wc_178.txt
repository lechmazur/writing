<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kavi's frugality and devotion are consistently embodied through micro-choices, such as his meticulous ritual setup, compelling his high-stakes act. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The final renunciation—keeping the star-cloud secret—is earned by prior causality with visible cost in his solitary fulfillment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Kavi's solitary treasure, under an accumulative/textural lens that holds. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the planetary alignment window tightens causality. The magic square tile's use creates a decisive change in knowledge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice—the ziggurat observatory and obsidian dust diagram pressure Kavi's actions. Sensory details (e.g., "violet sky," "resonant hum") are selective and POV-filtered. The environment charges the final image of the revealed star-cloud.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (knowledge quest) escalates under accumulative lens through Kavi's agency-driven schematic work, culminating in the uncloaking. Cost is legible in his solitary gain versus the city's political chaos. One meaningful tightening—the celestial alignment—forecloses other options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of encrypted devotion emerges through particulars like the magic square ritual, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the star-cloud image, reweighting conservation as transcendent wealth without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—Kavi's frugal, astronomical focus colors diction and rhythm. Prose is lyrical yet precise, e.g., "a tomb awaiting a new corpse." No head-hopping; elision (e.g., ritual mechanics) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("starlight thicken, to bend") is coherent and heightens peak beats. Sentences advance story and atmosphere without padding or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of astronomy, magic, and personal devotion feels inevitable; the quiet climax transforms tropes through specific lived detail. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure reconfigures meaning.</comment>
