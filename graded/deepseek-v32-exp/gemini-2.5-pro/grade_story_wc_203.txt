<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Leo's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion in micro-choices like ignoring the chill. However, internal conflict is summarized rather than acted out simultaneously in scene, slightly reducing depth. The final engagement is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the ghost's resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual repricing as the mainspring barrel resolves the ghost's unrest, costing Leo's intervention under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and causality holds from observation to discovery. The cost is legible in the ghost's calm disappearance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "peeling paint" and "phantom smell of popcorn" filtered through Leo's POV. The micro-setting of the ceiling tile and dust pattern constrains his choice and charges the final image, integrating tightly with the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Leo's agency under the accumulative lens, from power cut to ghost's appearance to dust analysis. The stake in discovering hidden secrets tightens with his engagement, and cost is felt in the ghost's resolved tethered spirit. No coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of cracks in the façade emerges through particulars like fissures in clown smiles and the ghost's incomplete task, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the veil mended, inviting reflection through image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature in Leo's professional-spiritual lens, e.g., "study in liminal spaces." No head-hopping; prose rhythm controls pressure, though minor register consistency in peak beats prevents higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with sentences advancing multiple elements, e.g., "Silence crashed down, thick and absolute." No loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, enhancing clarity without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of ghost-seeing technician and circus setting, transforming tropes through specific details like the mainspring barrel. Risk-taking in premise heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
