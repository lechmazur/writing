<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion shown in his careful breath and persistent curiosity. Leo's emotional state is concretely rendered, and the final assurance action is earned by prior causality. Minor flaw: Elias's competence is slightly overbalanced without significant struggle, but it doesn't undermine closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with felt cost as Leo's peace is achieved and the signal vanishes, under a causal lens that holds throughout. The orientation is clear early, and the structure tightens meaningfully from setup to resolution. The cost is legible in Leo's emotional shift and the fading pulse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the mist-clad atrium and hearing aid constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's POV. The environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake in Leo's emotional well-being escalates through the intensifying pulse and Elias's agency in tracking and assuring. Cost is legible in Leo's slumped posture and subsequent calm. One meaningful tightening under the causal lens drives the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of connection and peace emerges organically through images and actions, not statement, with subtext in the pulses and photograph. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through Leo's acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Elias's poetic yet precise voice. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is elegant and rhythmic with high information density, no loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "moth fluttering against a windowpane" is coherent and effective. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs without sluggishness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise of a "contact tracer for hearts" is fresh and well-integrated, transforming tropes through specific details like the hearing aid method. Emotional truth and risk-taking in the quiet climax heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
