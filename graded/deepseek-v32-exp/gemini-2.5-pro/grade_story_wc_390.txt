<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion ("cold knot of dread") and micro-choices under pressure (adapting rather than fighting). The final choice is earned by prior causality, and her logical emotionality is demonstrated through action, not just label.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change and cost ("sweat-soaked and trembling"), under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and the key's persistent constraint shapes tactics. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful ("drift-ice marina," "lighthouse gallery"), with sensory detail filtered through POV. The environment and key object constrain choices and charge the final image, supporting the stake.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (protecting the artifact), escalation is driven by protagonist agency (adapting to the hum), and cost is legible (exhaustion). Pressure tightens under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of sonic absolution emerges from action and image, not statement, with a non-literal answer at the end. Subtext in the method (forgiveness through integration) resonates without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct (poetic yet precise), with perceptual signature ("monitored the ice-pack’s deep, resonant song"). No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with good propulsion. Minor overwriting ("fleshly ethereal" is strained) but no major loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Information density is high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh with specific synthesis (sonic engineering, vibrational matching). Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, and risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
