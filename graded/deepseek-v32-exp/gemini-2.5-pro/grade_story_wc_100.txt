<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his weariness and desperation to end the psychic noise; his interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, and his final choice to revitalize the astrolabe is earned by prior causality. However, the characterization lacks deep contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, limiting the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with Elias achieving silence, a resonant reconfiguration under the causal lens; cost is legible in his relief and settled weariness. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight from the package to the library journey and resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the underwater library and broken lens constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details like "salt-stained box" and "shimmering light" are filtered through Elias's POV, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (silencing the noise) and escalate through Elias's agency under the causal lens, culminating in the revitalization action with legible cost; one meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of rest and resolution emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in the lens and library; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though it leans slightly straightforward.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a weary, poetic voice consistent under pressure; perceptual signature is strong in phrases like "discordant energy," and elision (e.g., the journey) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or scaffolds, and figurative language like "spiderweb of despair" is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes undertaker, unquiet dead, and sunken library with freshness; emotional truth and specific details make it organic, and risk-taking in the closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
