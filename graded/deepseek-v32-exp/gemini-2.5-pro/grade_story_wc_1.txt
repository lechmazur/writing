<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as sifting through ruins and observing frost patterns. Her final choice to create art is earned by prior causality, showing visible cost in overcoming fear. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The resolution forecloses a path with felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Kaelen integrates fire and ice into her art, with cost legible in her lighting the kiln. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through patterns and images. Orientation is clear early, and the plot coheres without causality breaks. The persistent constraint of the canyon's environment shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the canyon and frost patterns constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Kaelen's POV, such as the "delicate lacework of ice." Micro-setting elements like the ledger and kiln are integrated into action, supporting the 9+ quick test by altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (overcoming trauma and finding purpose) escalates under the accumulative lens through Kaelen's agency in decoding frost patterns and retracing the path. Cost is visible in her final act of creating art, which forecloses her fear. Pressure tightens meaningfully without coincidence, and the ending reweights options with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the integration of fire and ice, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the art piece, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in implication, like the frost patterns echoing the ledger, and avoids tidy resolutions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Kaelen's artist-eye observations. Voice is poetic yet consistent, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping or register drift; elision (e.g., the smugglers' backstory) is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, as in "ghost-heat on her skin." Syntax varies naturally, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of glass artistry, smuggler's ledger, and frost patterns is fresh and non-obvious, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative design) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details anchor universals, and the core premise is transformed through grounded choices.</comment>
