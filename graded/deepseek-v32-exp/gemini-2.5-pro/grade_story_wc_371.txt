<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. Her micro-choices, like holding the bread and planting seeds, reveal a hierarchy of values. The patrolman's brief characterization adds relational pressure without overshadowing her arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost legible in the "less empty" silence.

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency when Elara uncloaks her purpose to the patrolman, narrowing options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in the "fragile peace" and the reweighted stakes of memory and neglect.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of finding the sacred in the ordinary emerges through particulars like the bread and gardening, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
