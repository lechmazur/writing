<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "the weight in my gut"). Final choice to close the valve is earned by prior causality and conflicting impulses (skepticism vs. engagement), with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly; closure is a decisive change (valve closure) with felt cost ("the weight in my gut hadn't disappeared... I had found the measure"). Orientation is clear early, and structure coheres without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful (e.g., "oily water," "beaded valve wheel"), constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and reflect POV urgency, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under causal lens (investigating sounds, forcing valve closed). Dominant stake (internal guilt) tightens with legible cost (exhaustion and weight carried).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of carrying guilt emerges through events and images (confession, ghost shift), with resonant, non-literal answer at end. Subtext operates in implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature ("drowsy alertness"). Voice remains coherent under pressure; radio dialogue advances plot naturally without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts. Figurative language is effective (e.g., "sleeping iron beasts"), and sentences advance momentum clearly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of psychological and supernatural elements feels inevitable; risk-taking in blending confession with ghost shift heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
