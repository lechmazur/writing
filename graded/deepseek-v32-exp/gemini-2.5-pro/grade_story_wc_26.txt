<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in love for Elara, with interiority shown through embodied actions like comparing videos. His final choice to integrate the shadow is earned by prior causality, demonstrating a meaningful change with visible cost in the altered essence. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as his deliberate approach versus the urgency of the blight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change as Elara's archive metamorphoses, under a causal lens where Kael's actions drive the plot. Cost is legible in the "silvery blue" color and sorrowful beauty, and orientation is clear early with who, where, and when anchored. The persistent constraint of the shadow's origin shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the library and river stone constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like the "cool river stone" and "spectral light-vines" are filtered through Kael's POV, and the environment pressures decisions by enabling the integration sequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the causal lens, from detecting the blight to integrating the shadow, with cost unmistakable in Elara's transformed essence. The dominant stake of preserving hope tightens through his investigation, foreclosing the option of destruction in favor of acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, with subtext in gestures like Elara's constrained smiles, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer about embracing darkness as part of light. No moralizing; wisdom is earned through Kael's struggle and the final image of "luminous regret."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature like "sharp-eyed dusk noticer," and rhythmic control under pressure. Elision is taught and paid off, such as the video comparison method, and no head-hopping occurs; voice remains coherent through emotional peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language like "a garden of thought" is coherent and purposeful, and sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the integration sequence without obscuring clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh premise of shareable dreams and internal trauma, transformed through specific choices like the video comparison method. Synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking in the quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry, supported by emotional specificity.</comment>
