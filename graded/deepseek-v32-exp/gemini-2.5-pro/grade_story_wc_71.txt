<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure; her realization about anchoring lives is earned through prior causality, and the final image shows cost in the changes observed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (the man's contemplation and woman's gardening); the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, and orientation is clear from the start with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (e.g., "streetlights daydreamed") reflect POV bias; the orris root and white cube house constrain choices and charge the final image, integrating setting with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fighting deadness) escalates through Elara's agency under the Accumulative lens, from small acts to targeting the source; cost is legible in the risk and resulting changes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in displaced objects; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the flamingo and flowers, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature and poetic voice; elision is purposeful, and rhythmic control under pressure supports the closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats like the realization scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of tropes through specific details; risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
