<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation shifts credibly from academic to urgent rescue, with consistent traits and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., researching gaps, using the diary). Interiority is concrete, though some emotions lean slightly abstract. The final step is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal drive holds strong: Kael's arrival incites the mission, Elara's research and negotiation lead decisively to closure. The ending lands with cost (weight on shoulders) and a resonant reconfiguration (hopeful crescendo). Orientation is clear early, and lens coherence supports escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (Scriptorium as living composition, sensory details like rustle of vellum) and constrains choices (labyrinthine stacks, silent rock). The botanical diary functions as micro-setting, charging the final image and shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (save future by accessing library), and escalation is driven by Elara's agency under causal lens (researching gaps, finding diary, negotiating). Cost is legible in the negotiation risk and final weight. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events (knowledge preservation vs. utility, learning from past) with subtext in botanical encoding and unheard symphony. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Elara, with distinct perceptual signature (poetic, academic lexicon). Voice modulates under pressure, and minimal dialogue with Curators is goal-driven. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is purposeful (e.g., "Rosetta Stone of petal and stem"), and clarity is maintained even in peak beats. Propulsion supports closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes arcane linguistics, botanical cryptology, and temporal rescue with specificity. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices (e.g., diary as key). Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
