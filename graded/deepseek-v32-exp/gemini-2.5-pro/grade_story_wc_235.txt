<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses (jealousy of past selves) acting in scene. The final shift to artistry is earned by the flight trance, with visible cost in the emotional struggle. No diagnostic label-speak; micro-choices under pressure reveal value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change from chaos to narrative artistry, felt cost in the reconfigured perspective. Causal lens holds: frustration triggers trance, leading to flight and insight. Orientation is clear early with cabin and scroll anchors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (e.g., "charcoal stick crumbled," "dust motes") and constrains choice—the cabin's confinement and scroll's use charge the final image. Sensory details are POV-filtered and purposeful, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under causal lens: feral nostalgia builds to trance and flight, forcing a stance crystallization. Cost is legible in the emotional shift and foreclosed paths of jealousy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—flight as perspective reconfigures chaos into art without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of soaring above one's timeline.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is consistent, poetic, and degrades under stress (e.g., "frustration a bitter taste"). No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated (e.g., "feral nostalgia gnawed"). Clarity and propulsion maintain momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of chronological confusion and lucid dreaming feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the flight trance heightening stakes. Specific details (e.g., birch bark scroll) avoid template plots, offering fresh angle.</comment>
