<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elias's grief-driven motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and contradictory impulses (e.g., lying about the meteorite versus truth-telling). His final choice to share the scroll is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his "raw" voice and the sharing of his "impossible."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (Elias's shift from isolation to connection) and felt cost under the causal lens; the storm escalates logically from established stakes, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the meteorite and scroll recharging the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The bookshop attic constrains choices (e.g., the leak threatening the music) and charges the closure; sensory details like "dancing dust" are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's POV, with the meteorite and skylight actively shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving Lena's music) escalates meaningfully under the causal lens via the storm, driven by Elias's agency to save the sheets with Anna's help; cost is legible in his emotional opening and the shared scroll, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of grief and connection emerges through particulars like the meteorite and pigeons, with subtext in gestures (Anna's hand on his ankle); the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the scroll, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature ("unwavering column of sunlight"); dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit, and voice remains coherent under pressure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold; minor overwriting in phrases like "a bloom too fragile" is voice-motivated and doesn't obscure clarity, maintaining propulsion through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (pigeon trainer, meteorite) feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific grief and memory; risk-taking in quiet climax and lyrical prose heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
