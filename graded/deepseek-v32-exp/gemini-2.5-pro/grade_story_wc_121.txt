<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's interiority is concretely embodied, with contradictory impulses fighting then accepting the memory, and his final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost when he touches down solidly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Kael becomes whole, viaduct fades, and tablet inert; causal lens holds tightly with cost legible in the acceptance of pain; orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glowing viaduct constrains choices through shifting geometry and charges the final image with its fading; sensory details like ozone and wet metal are vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under causal lens, from treating tablet as map to accepting memory, with cost unmistakable in the pain he embraces; stakes are clear and tighten meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of self-confrontation emerges through particulars like the tablet and memory, with ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via wholeness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; prose reflects Kael's mind under pressure without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm with no loops or scaffold; figurative language like "each droplet catching the structure’s internal light like a fallen star" is clear and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of time loop and procedural generation feels inevitable; risk-taking in literary SF concepts heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional truth is specific.</comment>
