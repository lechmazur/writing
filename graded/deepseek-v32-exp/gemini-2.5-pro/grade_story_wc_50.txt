<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with embodied actions and micro-choices under pressure. However, the absence of internal conflict or contradictory impulses limits depth, preventing a higher score despite strong interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the mechanism reactivates, costing weeks of effort under the accumulative/textural lens. The cavern's geometry persistently constrains tactics, and orientation is clear early, with causality intact throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The marble cavern setting is vividly specific and constrains Elian's choices through its geometry and light reflections, charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and integrated into action, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elian's agency in reverse-engineering, with cost legible in the arduous process under the accumulative lens. However, the escalation lacks a tightening that forecloses options, capping the score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the harvest of echoes concept, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the reawakened wonders. Subtext is rich in imagery, avoiding moralizing or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature that controls rhythm under pressure. No head-hopping or dialogue issues, and elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with high information density, clear propulsion, and no loops or artifacts. Minor overwriting in figurative language does not harm clarity or closure, maintaining rhythmic variety.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes originality through the harvest of echoes and reverse-engineering with light, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and transformation is specific.</comment>
