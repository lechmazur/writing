<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's face-blindness and tactile sensitivity are consistent traits that drive her actions, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., tracing the coin's indentations) revealing her hierarchy of values. However, internal conflict is minimal, and emotional progression is somewhat tidy, lacking contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost (imminent demolition contrasted with the created cosmos), under an Accumulative/Textural lens that holds. The orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of time shapes tactics, but the lens is slightly less dominant in mid-beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice (e.g., the heartwood as key), with sensory detail woven through action. However, it is capped due to Q2 not reaching 9.0, though it charges the final image effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (mirroring the sky before demolition), with escalation driven by agency under the Accumulative lens (e.g., machinery groans increasing pressure). Cost is legible in the final image, but the escalation is linear without major reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of limits and beauty emerges through particulars (e.g., the fractal pattern and final sky), with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext operates in implication, avoiding moralizing, though it leans slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical, sensory-driven perceptual signature. Prose rhythm controls pressure, and elision (e.g., the coin's history) is taught and paid off, but minor uniformity in sentence structure prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent, but it is capped due to Q2 not reaching 9.0, despite excellence in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis (face-blind artist in a petrified library), with risk-taking in accumulative design that heightens stakes. The ending feels inevitable, transforming familiar tropes through specific detail and emotional truth.</comment>
