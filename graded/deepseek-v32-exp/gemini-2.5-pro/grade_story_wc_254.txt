<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure; the final renunciation is earned through dissolving boundaries, though minor abstraction limits internal contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost ("shivering not from cold but from a profound quietude"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds tightly; orientation is clear early, and causality is seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "thrumming light" and "frozen lake"; the colonnade and atrium constrain choices and charge the final image as a "blank page."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency in paraphrasing the hum, under the Accumulative lens; cost is legible in his dissolution of self and the quietude that follows.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally from Kael's journey, with subtext in images like the colonnade as "blueprint"; the ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and perceptual signature; diction like "cloud-shadow poet" and "lantern-moth hush" is consistent and heightens pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and dense with varied rhythm, advancing story without loops; minor overwriting in phrases like "geological time and starlight" but no muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of forbidden knowledge and internal pilgrimage; risk-taking in lyrical focus feels inevitable, with specific details like the quartz colonnade.</comment>
