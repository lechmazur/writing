<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and rooted in guilt, with embodied emotions and internal conflict shown through his frantic work and eventual acceptance. The final choice to not edit the past is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost when he transmits a footnote instead of editing history. The causal drive lens holds, and the gravitational anomaly's constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly and fountain pen constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like "hummed with a silence that had weight" woven purposefully into action and perception.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of acceptance emerges through particulars like the pen and signal, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer in "threshed the meaning" without moralizing.</comment>
