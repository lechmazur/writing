<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and rooted in past failure, with concrete interiority like "snowmelt ardor." Micro-choices under pressure, such as unbraiding the rope, reveal values, and the final sketching action shows earned endurance. However, contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (the sigil's appearance and dissolution) and felt cost in "quiet sea of fulfillment." The accumulative lens holds, and orientation is clear early. Persistent constraint of past failure shapes tactics, and cost is legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the ice sanctum and ceremonial rope constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "aurora’s shifting curtains" are filtered through POV, and micro-setting elements alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving names escalates through Elian's agency in weaving the rope, with cost legible in the transient sigil. Under the accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, but the escalation is more fulfillment-driven than option-narrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and forgiveness emerges organically from actions and images, like the light sigil representing sound. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the sketching of the "ghost of a ghost."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, such as "technically gentle" hands and "snowmelt ardor." Voice is poetic and consistent, though slightly ornate at times. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variation, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats like the sigil projection. Propulsion remains strong throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing wax casting, ice sanctum, and memory preservation into an organic whole. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
