<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her choices under pressure. Her emotional shifts are embodied through gravitational changes, and her final acceptance of personal sorrow is earned through prior causality. The resolution forecloses her vigil with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in Elara's peace and the opened dimension. The accumulative lens holds, with each photograph adding density leading to the climax. Orientation is clear early, and no causality breaks occur.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice—the Scrap-Ark groans in sympathy with Elara's emotions, and the photographs/Kwan Yin's Tear charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency in processing each photograph, tightening under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in her physical and emotional shifts, culminating in the climax where her own sorrow risks crushing her before resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of acceptance through shadow work emerges from concrete actions and images, not statement. The ending offers a non-literal answer via the opened dimension, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like stitching.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, rhythmic prose reflects Elara's resolve. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., memory accesses) is taught and paid off. Voice modulates with emotional pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("needle thin as a whisper") is purposeful and clear. No artifacts harm closure; read-aloud test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of pacifism, shadow work, and sci-fi elements feels inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids templates, and the closure reconfigures familiar tropes.</comment>
