<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Alistair's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with micro-choices like using the loop pedal revealing his values. Elara's possession shows internal conflict, and the final refutation is earned through causal actions. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; cost is visible in her recovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change and cost (Elara's gasp, fallen palette) under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and the plot tightens through Alistair's rhetorical devices. No causality breaks; the entity's refutation is driven by prior actions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image—the dimensional anchor and silence shape tactics. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful (e.g., "humming at a frequency felt only in the bones"). The palette's evolution from oppressive gray to "one of many" reinforces theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Alistair's agency, using rhetorical questions and sound loops to unravel the entity. Dominant stake (saving Elara) tightens through meaningful turns, with cost legible in her ragged breath. No coincidental resolutions; pressure coheres under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars—complexity vs. monochrome philosophy—without moralizing. Subtext in dialogue and imagery (e.g., gray as loneliness) leads to a resonant, non-literal answer. The final image reweights prior material without stated thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature (e.g., "decorates with silence"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven for both characters. No head-hopping; voice modulates with pressure, and elision (e.g., rhetorical devices) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "carving it into the air"). Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs, and clarity is maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and non-obvious, synthesizing exorcism with rhetorical and sonic elements. Tropes are transformed through specific details (loop pedal, palette). Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
