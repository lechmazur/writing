<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to carry the message is clear and intensifies through sacrificial memory loss; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., trembling hands, hollow heart); final choice to weave locking threads is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in the wistful longing; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through descriptive density; orientation is clear early; memory loss constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting (orchard, bamboo forest) and micro-setting (loom, amber bead) constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details are vivid and purposeful, filtered through POV; environment pressures the sacrifice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (carrying the message) escalates under Accumulative lens through memory sacrifice; agency drives tightening (recommencing weaving); cost is unmistakable in severing connection and hollow grief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice and memory emerges from events and images without moralizing; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through Elara's contextless longing; subtext operates in silence and gesture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is selective and consistent; no head-hopping; rhythmic control under pressure enhances emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and clear in peak beats (e.g., "silent nova"); propulsion advances story seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of weaving, memory sacrifice, and communication feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes; core elements are organic and transformative.</comment>
