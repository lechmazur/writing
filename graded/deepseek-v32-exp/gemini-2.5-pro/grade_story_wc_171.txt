<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in trait; his operatively gentle approach constrains choices, and the generals' weariness and eventual surrender feel earned. Micro-choices under pressure, like using dust for the sigil, reveal values with cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the treaty signing, a Resonant Reconfiguration under the causal lens; cost is legible in Vorlag's "profound surrender" and the unified light. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the ritual significance drives causality without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ancient terrace and celestial bodies constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details like "cracked marble" and "night-blooming jasmine" are selective and purposeful. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the setting pressures the ritual's outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of peace escalates through Elias's agency under the causal lens; his speech and ritual force a tightening choice with cost in the generals' trembling signatures. No coincidence; resolution earned by protagonist alteration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of redemption's price emerges through particulars like the dust sigil and "weeping conjunction," offering a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in gesture and silence, such as Kaelen's "challenge and plea," resists tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is consistently poetic yet grounded, e.g., "a carefully calibrated instrument." Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven, with subtext in the generals' reactions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts; figurative language like "shattered promise" serves pressure. No loops or scaffold; sentence-level propulsion accelerates toward closure with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of peace negotiation with ritual and celestial event feels inevitable; tropes transformed through specific details like the ebony clipboard and sigil. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
