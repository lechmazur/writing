<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot; Elara's internal conflict is embodied in her posture and voice, with her final choice earned through the logical argument. The cost is visible when she feels the case's weight shift from sacred burden to millstone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost as Elara hands over the document; causal lens holds tightly with Aris's argument directly causing her shift. Orientation is clear early, and the structure is coherent in a single scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the ivy and station mirroring thematic decay; the environment charges the final image when Aris points to the ivy as suffocation, constraining the argument's logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes of truth vs. peace are signaled early; escalation is driven by Aris's agency in drawing historical parallels, tightening pressure on Elara until her decision forecloses the lie with visible cost in her resignation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth vs. noble lies emerges organically from dialogue and events; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the document handover, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Aris; voice is distinct and measured, with dialogue natural and goal-driven; perceptual signature is clear in Aris's rational observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or artifice; figurative language like "ivy strangling the station" is purposeful and enhances clarity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise of noble lie is transformed through specific historical parallels and character-driven conflict; synthesis feels inevitable, though risk-taking is moderate in the quiet, dialogue-heavy climax.</comment>
