<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and rooted in a desperate need to forgive, compelling his high-stakes choice. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (trembling after the act), and his final endurance is earned by prior causality. However, internal conflict between treason and loyalty is more stated than shown in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost (trembling strain and profound peace) under a Causal lens, as Kaelen's modification alters the covenant's meaning. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of precision shapes tactics. The decisive change is legible and inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the sanctuary and aurora pressuring Kaelen's choices through solemnity and light. Sensory details (dripping stalactites, chilled marble) are filtered through POV, and the rose thorn as a micro-setting constrains the key action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ending the war without breaking the covenant) escalates under Causal lens through Kaelen's agency, with cost legible in his strain. The single tightening—modifying the scroll—narrows options and forecloses the path of perpetual war with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness emerges through particulars like the pinprick of ink and "unlocked chain," offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in "treason of semantics" deepens complexity, but the theme leans slightly toward abstraction in motivation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature reflecting Kaelen's focus. Rhythmic control under pressure ("as stalactites drip, so must he work") and purposeful elision (the glyph's mechanics) are taught and paid off. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("pearl twilight," "comma of liberation") is coherent and heightens pressure without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion advances story and atmosphere seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of "calibrated treason" offers a fresh synthesis, transforming forgery into compassion through specific details (heritage rose thorn, grammatical glyph). Risk-taking in subtle betrayal heightens stakes, and the resolution feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
