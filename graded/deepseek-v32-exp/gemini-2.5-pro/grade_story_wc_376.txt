<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation for authenticity is clear and consistent, driving his actions from the start. His internal conflict is embodied through specific choices, like sighing at dishonesty and obsessing over the map. The final decision to plant the seed is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his commitment to cultivating truth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal chain from finding the map to discovering the seeds, with closure on-page as Elian plants the Veritas seed, reconfiguring his purpose. The drive lens (Causal) holds throughout, and cost is legible in the final image. Orientation is clear early, with no disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the greenhouse city and toxic sky pressuring choices, such as the fern wilting near dishonesty. The environment constrains action and charges the final image when Elian kneels in the plaza. Sensory details are selective and filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth vs. dishonesty is signaled early and escalates through Elian's agency in piecing the map and following its path. Under the causal lens, escalation tightens options, and cost is visible in his renunciation of mere calligraphy for cultivation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of honesty emerges organically through events like the fern wilting and seed discovery, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the Veritas Bloom, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic voice that reflects Elian's perception. Dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision (e.g., map piecing) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise and vivid, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Peak beats, like the vault discovery, maintain clarity without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh, transforming tropes through specific details like the truth-revealing plant and postal plate. Synthesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the quiet closure that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
