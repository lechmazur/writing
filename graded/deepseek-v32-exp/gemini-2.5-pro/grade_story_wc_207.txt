<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying to compel higher-stakes choices. Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion and no stock phrasing. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost when she leaves the compass and scent unbottled.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot has strong causal linkages under the inferred Causal lens, with closure landing as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) when Elara understands the impossibility of capture. Cost is legible in the final image of leaving the compass, and orientation is clear within 120 words. No plot breaks or teleporting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, constraining choices like the compass direction and hinged stone. The subterranean lagoon charges the final image with its luminescence and scent, and sensory details are selective and purposeful, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled early and escalate through Elara's agency under the Causal lens, with a meaningful tightening when she uses psychometry to find the way. Cost is unmistakable in her decision to forego bottling, narrowing options with visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in the realization that some mysteries are better left uncaptured. The ending offers a non-literal answer through the final image of the resonant hush, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with a lyrical perceptual signature fitting for a sensory collector. POV is stable and close, with rhythmic control under pressure and no head-hopping. Elision in psychometry is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise and evocative, with high information density and no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is effective and not overdone, maintaining clarity and propulsion. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, supporting the hushed tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of a petrichor collector is fresh and well-executed, with specific details that feel organic. The synthesis of elements is non-obvious, and the quiet ending takes a risk that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
