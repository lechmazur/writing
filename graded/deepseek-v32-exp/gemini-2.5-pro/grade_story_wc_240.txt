<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in his spatial gift and grief, compelling higher-stakes choices. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as feeling the "phantom weight of her hand." The final choice to release the figure is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his exhaustion. Contradictory impulses act in scene, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost: Kael's release of the figure and his exhaustion. Causal lens holds tightly from his actions to the outcome. Orientation is clear within 120 words, anchoring who, where, and when. The persistent constraint of the dimensional field shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "damp earth and ozone" filtering through Kael's POV. The bioluminescent mushroom farm constrains choices by generating the energy fields and charges the final image with its "hazy luminescence." Spatial choreography is coherent, and details are integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Kael's internal conflict to let go, escalated by his agency in building and using the device. Under the causal lens, pressure tightens to the climax where he activates the resonator, with cost legible in his "profound exhaustion." Resolution is earned by his alteration, foreclosing a path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of letting go emerges through events and images, not direct statement, with subtext in gestures like the figure's smile of release. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the finch's echo, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflecting Kael's spatial gift in prose rhythm and diction. Voice modulates with pressure, such as in the "impossibly still" cavern moment. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure. Dialogue is absent, so not evaluated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold issues; figurative language like "quiet wildfire" is coherent and purposeful. Clarity is maintained in peak beats, with strong verbs and specific nouns enhancing momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of intrusion detection and spiritual release, transformed through specific choices in character and world. Turns feel earned in hindsight, with risk-taking in the permeable barrier concept heightening stakes. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, and the closure effect is legible and inevitable.</comment>
