<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His final decision to use the maze's geometry is earned by prior causality, and the cost of memory loss is felt on the page, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—Elias's memory loss—and cost is legible in the final image. The inferred hybrid lens (dominantly causal) holds, with the maze's geometry as a persistent constraint shaping tactics and the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, particularly the hyperbolic maze which is essential to the climax. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, charging the final image with the green scent and paths.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled and escalate through Elias's agency under the causal lens, driven by his confrontation with the fragment. The cost is unmistakable in the memory disintegration, with a meaningful tightening that forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between time and memory, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through Elias's amnesia. Subtext is rich in imagery, such as the fading photographs, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with a poetic rhythm and perceptual signature that reflects Elias's state. POV is stable, and any elision is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats like the disintegration scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The premise is a fresh synthesis of retrocognitive trapping and hyperbolic geometry, with risk-taking that heightens stakes. The closure reweights prior material with cost, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
