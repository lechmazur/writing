<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The Witness's motivation to unravel cosmic illusions and unify with silence is clear and consistent, driving her inward journey. Her final renunciation of self is earned by the accumulative understanding of spiral arbitration, with embodied emotion in the silence. However, the character lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as she stops witnessing and becomes the hush, a Resonant Reconfiguration under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The spiral path and dictionary use create causal linkages, and orientation is anchored early. The cost is legible when the book falls silently and she unifies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with obsidian floors and resounding hush, constraining choices through the spiral path and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, integrated with action. The dictionary as a micro-object reweights meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes in unraveling illusions escalate through the accumulative journey inward, driven by protagonist agency. The cost of self-loss is felt at closure, but escalation is more gradual than tightening, under the textural lens. No reversals, but deepening coherence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of cosmic resolution emerges through particulars like spiral arbitration and the dictionary, with subtext in silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material. Earned through the Witness's specific experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control. Perception is filtered through the Witness's bias, and elision (e.g., "wanderingly exact") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language like "resounding hush" is purposeful and clear. Sentences advance story and atmosphere seamlessly, with strong propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of cosmic resolution and librarian archetype, transformed through specific details like spiral arbitration. Risk-taking in quiet, philosophical tone heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
