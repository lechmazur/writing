<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's characterization is concrete with stained hands and scars, embodying his trade; his obliging nature and steadiness motivate key actions, and his internal shift to vertigo is earned through the experiment's outcome. Dr. Aris's obsession is clear and dramatized. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; the final realization carries cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds from Aris's request to the lever pull and hologram reveal. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in Elias's "re-calibrated" understanding. Orientation is clear early; the nexus experiment tightens options decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid with violet gas giant and crystalline wings, constraining choice via the planetary hush and orbital resonance. The device as micro-setting charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving time's lateral nature) escalates through Elias's agency in pulling the lever. Cost is legible in his vertigo and altered worldview. Under causal lens, one meaningful tightening forecloses prior assumptions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of time as tapestry emerges through the hologram's adjacent echo, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the "mechanical warmth" and quiet vertigo, earned through specific experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV (Elias) is stable with distinct perceptual signature blending mechanical and poetic diction. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven; no head-hopping. Voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high information density; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("falling sideways into an ocean of possibility") is controlled and purposeful. Rhythm varies, supporting momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of time theory with lepidoptera mythology feels inevitable; risk-taking in conceptual repricing heightens stakes. Specific details (hydro-spanner, orbital resonance) avoid template plots.</comment>
