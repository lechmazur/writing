<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to translate silence into music is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and internal conflict during the trauma intrusion. Her final choice to weave trauma with the flower's potential is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in exhaustion and peace. Contradictory impulses act in scene, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (exhaustion and peace) under the Accumulative/Textural lens, which holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the trauma intrusion serves as a meaningful tightening. The persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory constrains choices by serving as a score for Elara's projections, charging the final image. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, with the setting integrated into action. The circlet and tuning fork case function as micro-settings that influence tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with the trauma intrusion forcing a choice that narrows options. Cost is legible in the exhaustion and transformation of emotions. The dominant stake of translating silence tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, with the ending offering a non-literal answer to transforming trauma without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, such as the flower's bloom representing beauty in silence. The final image reweights prior material with resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is consistent and poetic, with purposeful elision in the trauma flashback that pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, supporting the emotional arc without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes silence, trauma, and sensory mapping in a non-obvious way that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details like the heat-mapping circlet transform familiar tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
