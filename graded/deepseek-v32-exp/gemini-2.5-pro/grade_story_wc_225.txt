<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and agonizing, with embodied interiority shown through fidgeting with the labyrinth. His flaw (pride over safety) drives inevitable mistakes, and the final acceptance is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the "aching relief." No diagnostic speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (hush unraveling) and felt cost (relief as a truce). Causal lens holds strong: his decoding leads directly to realization and resolution. Orientation is anchored early, and no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the frozen village and tapestry constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details (e.g., "petrified stone lip," "deafening clang") are selective and filtered through POV, integrating into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forgiveness) escalates under causal lens through Elias's agency in decoding the tapestry. Cost is legible in the final relief, and one meaningful tightening (realization of his flaw) forecloses options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, with subtext in the labyrinth solving and tapestry decoding. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("wisdom to begin the next game") that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical yet controlled prose reflects Elias's focused repose. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., tapestry details) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language (e.g., "silence a physical weight") is coherent and purposeful, accelerating with scene needs. No register drift or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of chess, magical stasis, and forgiveness feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details (platinum labyrinth, woven hush). Risk-taking in blending elements heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
