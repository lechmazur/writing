<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with concrete, character-particular emotion; motivation to discover memory texture is clear and intensifies under pressure, driving micro-choices like layering stories. The final endurance (Earned Stasis) is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the solitude after the illusion shatters. No stock phrasing or diagnostic self-awareness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost as the illusion shatters, leaving narrator alone; accumulative/textural lens holds strong, taught early and paid off. Orientation is clear within 120 words; tides as persistent constraint shape tactics. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "slick, green-bearded pylons" filtered through POV; the container labyrinth and tides constrain choices and charge the final image. Specificity avoids generics, integrating into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake in memory texture escalates through layering agency under accumulative lens; cost is legible when the ship's horn shatters the illusion, foreclosing a path. One meaningful tightening is sufficient, driven by protagonist's actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of erasure and identity emerges organically from events and images, not statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the layered memory illusion. Subtext operates in implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct poetic voice with stable POV; perceptual signature is selective and biased, e.g., "filters through rust-holes." Rhythmic control under pressure, with purposeful elision taught early. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere, e.g., "the tide breathes in, and the world arrives in steel boxes."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh premise with specific synthesis of ghost-like identity and memory layering; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth avoids templates, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
