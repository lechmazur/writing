<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; his internal conflict during the storm and earned final choice show embodied emotion and micro-choices. The closure reveals a credible endurance with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly with because/therefore linkages; closure is a decisive change (storm parting) with felt cost (isolation reconfigured). Orientation is clear early, and the map discovery pivots the climax without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices (storm pressures actions, portico filters perception). The cobalt glass and observatory charge the final image, meeting the 9+ test with purposeful sensory detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elian's agency under causal lens; the duet of voices forces a choice, and his rejection narrows options with cost (storm's pause). One meaningful tightening drives the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of human agency versus spectral forces emerges through particulars; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in prophecies and final broadcast enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is consistent under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision (e.g., map discovery) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("lightning clawed") enhances clarity without muddle, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh specificity; the cobalt prophet concept and variant allegiance feel organic. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
