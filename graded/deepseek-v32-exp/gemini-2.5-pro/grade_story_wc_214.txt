<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and intensifies, driving his shift from detached observation to empathetic connection. His internal conflict is embodied through concrete actions, and the final embrace of vulnerability is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The spiritual curiosity trait constrains choices authentically, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in Kael's reconfigured understanding of dust and light. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pattern intensification leading to the empathetic climax. Orientation is clear early, and no causality breaks occur.</comment>
