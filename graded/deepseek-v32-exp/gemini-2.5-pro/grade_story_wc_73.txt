<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; his grim optimism compels higher-stakes choices, and his final triumph is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the agony of regret.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative lens; the cost is legible in "the weight of unspoken words pressed on his chest," and the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elian's agency through mathematical work; cost is unmistakable in the felt regret after the rupture, narrowing options under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and regret emerges without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer by reconfiguring the staircase as a canvas.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept is a fresh synthesis of infinite space and mathematical memory; risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
