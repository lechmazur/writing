<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, with interiority shown through embodied emotion ("tremor in his own veins") and micro-choices under pressure. His calmly inventive trait drives the plot, and the final successful revolution feels earned by prior causality, though the cost is more conceptual than deeply felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (authority dismantled silently), under a causal lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the sundial mechanism is set up and paid off cleanly, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The luminous fort and blackout setting pressure choices and supply key resources (e.g., phosphorescent walls enable the network). The sundial and quill holder act as micro-settings that constrain tactics and charge the final image of winking lights.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the causal lens, from seizing the blackout opportunity to activating the network. Stakes are clear, and cost is legible in the silent transfer of control, though it leans toward success without heavy personal sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silent revolution emerges through events and images (e.g., light patterns vs. shouted orders), with subtext in implication. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "pulsed with a gentle life"), and voice remains consistent under pressure. Purposeful elision (e.g., coded angles) is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language ("heartbeat of the fort") is coherent and supports momentum, and closure image is clear without obscurity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of silent revolution via coded light network feels inevitable in hindsight, with specific details (bronze quill, sundial) transforming tropes. Risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
