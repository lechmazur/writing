<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority; her observational habit drives micro-choices under pressure, and her final renunciation is earned through prior causality with visible cost in the grotto scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative drive lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing via Elara's realization, landing with felt cost in her acceptance of transition. Orientation is clear early, and structure coheres in a single scene with reflection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grotto setting is vividly sensory and POV-filtered; it constrains choice (e.g., the snail observation) and charges the final image with starlight and shell motifs, making it indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes center on emotional transition; escalation occurs through Elara's internal deepening under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in her sad but resolved stance at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of transition emerges through particulars (cicada, tidal pools) without moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Elara's statement, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and consistent, modulating under pressure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold artifacts, and figurative language coheres in peak beats like the cicada imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of emotional transition through specific metaphors feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
