<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to translate isolation into independence is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under the pressure of brittle awakenings. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotions like tasting salt and feeling fur. The final choice to coexist is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the realization that isolation is preservation. Contradictory impulses act in scene, and the renunciation forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Kael accepts his memories, with cost legible in "he felt the strength of his independence." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory density to a cadence shift. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight from the sundial placement to the stone circle's hum. No persistent constraint issue, but the closure effect is undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the tidal library and atomically reflective floor constraining choice by enabling the vision of memories. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as the "swirling script of a nebula-bound codex." The environment charges the final image of the extinct parade, and micro-setting elements like the sundial reweight meaning. No generic placeholder or momentum stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of internal conflict between isolation and memory integration escalates under the Accumulative lens through density increase in the brittle awakenings. Protagonist agency drives the tightening via the sundial placement and focus on the hum, leading to a reweighting of options. Cost is legible in the transformation of isolation into independence, with no coincidence resolving the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of coexistence emerges from events and images, such as the sundial becoming a symbol of "singular now," offering a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, like the reflections not being revenants. Earned through Kael's struggle, and the final image reweights prior material with resonance. No thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic, reflective prose like "the last mind to hold the shape of a wing." Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and diction remains within Kael's lexicon. No head-hopping or register mismatch; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure. Rhythmic control under pressure heightens the accumulative effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without padding or loops. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, such as "cataclysm of the soul." No scaffold sentences or mixed metaphors; syntax accelerates with scene needs. Closure image is clear, and read-aloud ear test passes with natural variation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes fantasy and psychological depth with a fresh angle on memory and isolation. Specific details like the tidal library and atomically reflective floor feel organic and indispensable. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, and risk-taking in lyric design heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passed; premise is not derivative.</comment>
