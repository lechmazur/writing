<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure; his interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, and his final action of placing the tape is earned by prior causality with visible cost in Anya's hope and his satisfaction. The desire to be "visible to those who need you" is dramatized through micro-choices, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elias witnesses Anya's gratitude, with felt cost in his quiet satisfaction; the accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, and the persistent constraint of the power outage shapes tactics. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality is tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The library setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "sapphire hush" and flickering lights woven into action; environment pressures Elias's movements and mirrors internal states, avoiding generic description. Specificity is high, with the ventilation shaft and reading table altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the accumulative/textural lens, with the stake of preserving Anya's family history tightening through his discovery and placement of the tape; cost is legible in Anya's despair turning to hope, and no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through events and images, such as memory and invisibility, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through Anya's gratitude and Elias's retreat; subtext operates in gesture and silence, avoiding moralizing or abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Elias's silent, methodical observations; prose rhythm and diction control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity, and no head-hopping or register drift occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts; figurative language like "practiced silence" and "magnetic ghost" is purposeful and coherent, and sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise of a crawl space dweller with sense memory is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in the quiet, lyrical approach heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the concept is fully integrated with character and conflict.</comment>
