<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions like "serene anger" and micro-choices such as ignoring rescue efforts. His final decision to disappear is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Kael disappears, reconfiguring options with felt cost under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without contradiction. The persistent constraint of the drone and ink shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "light flooded with a blade's sharp edge" and the wind-carved basin constraining Kael's choice. The environment pressures actions and charges the final image, integrated through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Kael's agency, from the eclipse to using the ink, narrowing options with a visible cost as he abandons his kin. Under the causal lens, pressure coheres and tightens, driven by protagonist choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through images and actions, exploring time, technology, and wildness without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via "serene anger" as a compass, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, rhythmic control under pressure. Perceptual signature is character-specific, and any elision is taught and paid off, such as the ink's patterns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful, and syntax varies naturally, supporting momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is original, synthesizing elements like the albino tracker and disappearing ink into a fresh, inevitable whole. Risk-taking in style and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors universals.</comment>
