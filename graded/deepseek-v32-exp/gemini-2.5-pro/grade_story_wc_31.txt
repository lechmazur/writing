<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and rooted in grief and vow; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (tracing brass tag). Micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values, and final endurance is earned with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene (hiding behind truth vs. pilgrimage).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in "exhausted and calm" and "world was not empty." Orientation is clear early; persistent constraint (vow) shapes tactics. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective (pier, wreck, library); sensory details purposeful (hissing lamps, salt spray). Micro-setting (library) constrains choice (switching off light) and charges final image. Environment mirrors internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict between grief and vow) escalates under accumulative lens through density increase (lighting lamps to dive to vision). Agency drives escalation; cost is unmistakable in emotional resolution. No coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (grief, memory, perception) emerges through particulars (vow, dive, vision); ending offers non-literal answer via indigo vision without moralizing. Subtext in actions and imagery; earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV stable; voice is lyrical with distinct perceptual signature (notices lights, colors). Rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping. Elision (e.g., dive preparation) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language coherent ("phantom preceding the light"); clarity and propulsion maintained in peak beats. Read-aloud test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief, sensory perception, and dive; tropes transformed through specific details (lamplighter, sound-color vow). Risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes; feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
