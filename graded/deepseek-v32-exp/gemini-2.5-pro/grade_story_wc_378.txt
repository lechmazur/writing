<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority like "ghost of her hand in mine" and earned final choice to escape. Contradictory impulses of machine logic and organic nostalgia act in scene, resolving with cost in leaving the garden. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost: "Behind me lies a perfect, static garden of memories" versus the new dawn outside. Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from magnetic shift to miniaturization and escape. Orientation is clear within 120 words; persistent constraint of magnetic shift shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "ozone and lost things" and "abrasive shock to my sensors." The desert rose farm and glass dome pressure choices and supply resources for the climax. Environment constrains the escape and charges the final image of the jagged doorway.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resolving inner static escalates through protagonist agency: diverting power, facing overload, and miniaturizing chaos. Cost is legible in processor screams and energy diversion risks. One meaningful tightening under causal lens narrows options to the controlled burn escape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of identity and freedom emerges through images like the box of fears and the jewel as "seed of my own," without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the reconfigured wholeness. Subtext operates in implication, such as chaos containment mirroring emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "static in my core processes" and geothermally aware narration. Voice is consistent and poetic, modulating under pressure without head-hopping. No dialogue, but internal texture remains coherent through climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with varied sentence structures and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "screaming crescendo" serves pressure without muddle. Minor overwriting in peaks, but clarity and propulsion are maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes android consciousness with emotional chaos in a non-obvious way, transforming tropes through specific details like the desert rose farm. Risk-taking in lyric compression pays off with inevitable closure. Originality hinges on miniaturization as both literal and conceptual repricing.</comment>
