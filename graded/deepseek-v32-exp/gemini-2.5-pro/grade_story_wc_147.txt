<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; internal conflict between instinct and purpose is embodied in scene, and the final endurance is earned with visible cost (death). Micro-choices, like overriding instinct to focus on a memory, reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds with because/therefore linkages; closure is Earned Stasis, foreclosing survival with cost legible in the final image (power flatlines, breath ragged). Orientation is anchored early, and persistent time constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the temple and vial constraining choices and charging the final image. Phosphorescent algae and obsidian altar integrate with action, and the environment pressures the protagonist's decisions directly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing the hush) escalates under causal lens via time pressure and psychic storm; protagonist agency drives tightening, and cost (death) is unmistakable on the page in the climax and ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of harnessing the ephemeral emerges through events and final image without moralizing; the vial as a "companion" reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity, offering a non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and urgent, modulating under pressure without head-hopping. Diction remains consistent, and elision (e.g., psychic storm) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold. Minor purple prose in peaks (e.g., "maelstrom of sensation") does not obscure clarity, and information density is high throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise of capturing silence is fresh and specific; tropes are transformed through grounded execution, and risk-taking in conceptual design heightens stakes without gimmickry. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
