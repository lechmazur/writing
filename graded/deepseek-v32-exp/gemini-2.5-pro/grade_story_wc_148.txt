<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, driving higher-stakes choices. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotions like "a name that tasted like a lie." The final choice to break the seal is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in others' doubt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost—the narrator claims the hush despite doubt. Causal lens holds with clear because/therefore linkages from exploration to discovery. Orientation is early and clear, with no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, e.g., "rusted iron needle stitching the gray sea," and constrains choice by guiding the narrator to the door. The environment charges the final image with the lighthouse remembering him.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding a true story escalates through protagonist agency—discovering and breaking the suspended moment. Cost is legible in the narrator's acceptance of others' doubt, tightening options under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth and legacy emerges through events and images, not statement. Subtext is rich in the confessional screen and hovering men. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical and melancholic, e.g., "copperlight repose." Voice remains consistent under pressure, with no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, e.g., "a rusted iron needle," and clarity is maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is original—a lighthouse prison with suspended time—and transformed through specific details like the confessional lattice. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
