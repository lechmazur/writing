<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in his precognitive curse and promise to Elara, driving high-stakes choices. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as "slumped to his knees" showing cost. His final action to harness the tide is earned by prior causality, with visible struggle and endurance. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; contradictions act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot is causal with clear orientation early: who (Kael), where (tidal bluff), when (night under aurora). Closure is a decisive change—he diverts the tide using star dust—with felt cost in his exhaustion. The inferred causal lens holds without ambiguity, and the promise constraint shapes tactics. No teleporting props or outline sequencing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "magnetic boots clung to basalt" and "aurora shimmered." The tidal bluff and aurora pressure choices, supplying resources (star dust) and constraints (incoming tide). Environment constrains the climax by forcing the harness action. No generic placeholder or white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting the bluff from the tide—is signaled early and escalates through Kael's agency under the causal lens. His use of star dust narrows options and carries cost (last resort). Pressure tightens meaningfully from vision to action, with no coincidence resolving conflict. Cost is legible in his physical strain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of harmony through patterns emerges implicitly from events, like the spiral circuit bending fate. Subtext operates in Kael's struggle against visions. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "dawn felt like his own," reweighting prior material without moralizing. No thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "fluid economy born of necessity." Voice is poetic yet consistent, modulating under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift. Purposeful compression in high-stakes beats, like "poured the star dust," maintains clarity. Dialogue absent, so not evaluated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with varied sentence openings and no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language, like "celestial river," is purposeful and coherent. No overwriting or artifact issues in peak beats; clarity persists through closure. Read-aloud test passes smoothly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of eel herder, precognition, and mathematical patterns feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific details (star dust, aurora). Risk-taking in blending elements heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivative premise or template plots; authenticity of vision is strong.</comment>
