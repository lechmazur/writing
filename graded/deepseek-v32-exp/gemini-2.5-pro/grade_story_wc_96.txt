<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and rooted in his monthly persona changes, with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as stepping forward with a poem. The relationship with Elara serves as a crucible, deepening stakes. However, minor lack of contradictory impulses in scene slightly limits the peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the arrival of drifters, reconfiguring hope and community under the Accumulative lens. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in Silas's invitation. The lens holds without ambiguity, but the escalation is subtle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the library's decay shaping rebuilding efforts, and charges the final image with the moonlit dome. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Silas's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rebuilding against decay escalates meaningfully with the drifters' arrival, narrowing options through Silas's agency. Cost is felt in the risk of trust, but the tightening is understated under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of rebuilding through words emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in gestures like poem distribution. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though it leans slightly toward declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic diction and rhythmic control. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, but minor convergence in emotional peaks occurs. Elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm, avoiding artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, though slight over-reliance on metaphor in peaks causes minimal muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of monthly persona changes and poetic resistance, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Specific details transform tropes, but risk-taking is moderate.</comment>
