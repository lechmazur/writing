<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to "map empathy onto action" is clear and consistently drives his choices, with embodied emotion shown in moments like the "familiar pull of a schism." Mara and Jorn have distinct, credible emotional states under pressure, and the resolution earns Mara's shift to "weary understanding" through prior causality. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; micro-choices reveal value hierarchies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: Kael's investigation via the quartz fragment leads directly to the revelation and community mending. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost in Mara's "shuddering sigh" and the release of "weighted breath." Orientation is anchored early in the lighthouse orchard, and no plot amnesia or convenience breaks causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the "lighthouse orchard" and "shifting ice floes" mirroring internal fragility and charging the final image. Sensory details like "frost-rimmed apple boughs" are selective and POV-filtered. The vintage store mirror and quartz fragment act as micro-settings that constrain choice and reconstitute the past.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of community cohesion escalates through Kael's agency, tightening as visions reveal the truth. Cost is legible in Mara's emotional drain and the "cold, shared reality." Escalation is driven by protagonist action under the causal lens, with no coincidence; the resolution forecloses accusation via earned understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of empathy and truth emerges organically from events, not statement, with subtext in gestures like Jorn's "shock and relief." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "first step toward mending," avoiding moralizing. Recurring images (e.g., weighted breath) reweight meaning without tokenism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with Kael's perceptual signature evident in rhythmic prose like "a calmly intuitive sense." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in Mara's "deeper, more personal chill." No head-hopping; elision in visions is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "weighted breath" is purposeful and coherent. Sentences advance story efficiently, e.g., "The raw truth settled over the small crowd." No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of empathy-driven conflict resolution in a harsh setting feels inevitable, with specific details like the quartz fragment and vintage store mirrors. Tropes are transformed through grounded character choices; risk-taking in intuitive peacekeeping heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
