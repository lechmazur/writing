<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion like "anxious elation" and micro-choices such as gripping the clipping. Her rooted state sharpens senses, and the final choice to create a path is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the reconfiguration of options.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the new path vector, felt cost in the enduring broken covenant, and causal drive lens holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of her rootedness shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "cobalt glade" and "scent of ozone," integrating into action and constraining choice through Elara's fusion to the weirwood, charging the final image of the shimmering boundary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reknitting existence) escalates through Kael's warning and Elara's agency with the clipping, driving a meaningful tightening into the new path with cost legible in the "frayed edges" and psychic effort.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of connection through scars emerges implicitly from events and images, with subtext in the psychic link; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "shining thread" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic prose, rhythmic control under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., Dissonance scars) taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied syntax without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "sap-slowed blood" is coherent and purposeful, with clear propulsion in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of root-bound visionary, eclipsed covenant, and Dissonance scars, feeling inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
