<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo's motivation evolves credibly from survival to proving vulnerability as power, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. His adaptation trait is consistently shown, but Julian's on-page presence is brief and slightly flat, limiting relational depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from betrayal to decryption and outwitting. Closure is a decisive change with visible cost (Julian's terror, Leo's empowerment), anchored early in orientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the rusted library and stars constraining choices (acrophobia) and supplying key objects (cast). Sensory details are selective and pressure-driven, though spatial clarity is slightly loose during the shelf sequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal identity to confrontation, driven by Leo's agency in decrypting and triggering the failsafe. Cost is legible in Julian's downfall and Leo's trembling certainty, under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability as power emerges through concrete actions and objects (shell, cast), with subtext in the final image. Avoids moralizing, but the concept is slightly explicit in Leo's internal realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending professional stuntman lexicon with emotional urgency. Dialogue is minimal but natural; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("earthquake in my soul") is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of identity construction and stunt double tropes, transformed through specific details (child's cast, adaptive trait). Risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
