<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with embodied emotion (tears, trembling hands) and micro-choices under pressure. However, contradictory impulses (grief vs. hope) are more sequential than simultaneous in scene, slightly limiting depth. Final endurance is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost (tears, raw solace) under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and causality via phone calls guides the build-up to the signal's activation, reinforcing the theme.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (starlit station, obsidian sky) and constrains choices (antenna construction). The censer foot as a micro-setting object charges the final image, integral to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigating loss) escalates through Elias's agency in building and activating the signal, with cost legible in his tears. Under accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, though the turn is more gradual than causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of solace through loss emerges organically via images and events (e.g., signal as "road home"), with subtext in the reverse migration concept. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; poetic voice modulates with emotional intensity. Cryptic phone call dialogue advances plot naturally, and elision is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language ("geography of loss") is consistent and enhances clarity, with no artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes post-apocalyptic tropes with fresh specificity (reverse migration, patchwork navigator). Emotional truth and risk-taking in lyric style heighten stakes, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
