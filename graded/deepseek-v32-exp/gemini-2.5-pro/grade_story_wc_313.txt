<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation shifts credibly from duty to obsession, with embodied interiority like "the loss felt measured in ghosts." His final choice to correct the record is earned by prior discoveries, showing contradictory impulses under pressure. No diagnostic label-speak; micro-choices reveal values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost as Elias reconfigures community understanding. Causal lens holds firmly from discovery to action; orientation is anchored early. The final image of shared murmurs legibly demonstrates cost, and constraints from the setting shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, e.g., the dried reservoir bed exposes the town, driving the plot. Sensory details like "cracked mud" are selective and POV-filtered. The ridgeway and reservoir function as micro-settings that pressure decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from measuring drought to uncovering truth, driven by Elias's agency under the causal lens. A meaningful tightening occurs as photographs narrow options, leading to the expungement with visible cost. No coincidence; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory and storytelling emerges through particulars like the photographs and label, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via community understanding. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, e.g., the "mirrored hush" filled with meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "the abrupt silence... stretching the twilight into a thin, resonant wire." Voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping. Purposeful elision in discoveries pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, e.g., the opening sentence sets tone efficiently. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Read-aloud test passes with clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of memory and history feels inevitable, with specific details like the liqueur label transforming tropes. Risk-taking in structure (discovery arc) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
