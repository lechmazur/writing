<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation to uncover truth is clear and consistent, driving the plot through observations and actions like reassembling letters. However, interiority lacks deep embodied emotion under pressure, with emotions stated rather than fully dramatized. The final intuition step is earned by prior causality, but emotional complexity is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as the stillpoint's truth replaces superstition, with cost legible in the silent physical law revelation. Causal linkages are tight from investigation to climax, and the inferred Causal lens holds without ambiguity. Orientation is anchored early, and the structure supports a meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The wasteland-orchard contrast is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "irradiated soil" and "defiant green" filtering through Kaelen's POV. The setting constrains choices by limiting access to the station and charges the final image of the shimmering stillpoint. Specificity is high without ornamental breadth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kaelen's agency under the Causal lens, from reassembling letters to intuiting the diamond's use, tightening the stake of truth vs. lies. The cost is conceptual but legible in the replacement of folklore with fact. However, stakes remain more intellectual than visceral, limiting peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus comforting lies emerges organically through events like the diamond's analysis and Thorne's letters, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the stillpoint discovery. Subtext in the locals' superstition enriches complexity without moralizing, and the conceptual repricing feels earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, evidenced by Kaelen's analytical observations. Prose rhythm and diction control are strong, though absence of dialogue limits voice distinction tests. No head-hopping or register drift, and elision in the intuition step is paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density and varied sentence rhythms. Figurative language like "greasy smear" is effective and coherent, and no artifacts like loops or scaffold obscure causality. Line-level craft supports closure without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes post-apocalyptic and sci-fi elements freshly, with the stillpoint concept and cursed diamond transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in the quiet, intellectual climax pays off, and the integration feels inevitable in hindsight, avoiding derivative patterns.</comment>
