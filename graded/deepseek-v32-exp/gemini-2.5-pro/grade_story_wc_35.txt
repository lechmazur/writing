<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation to "sandpaper rough memories" is clear and consistently drives his actions, with embodied emotions like feeling the Warlord's grief as "a sharp, specific agony." His final choice to subsume the remorse is earned through prior causality, and internal conflict is shown in scene, such as when he processes the contagious touch. The transformation to "sturdy" peace has visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost: Kaelen's subsumption of remorse scours him clean, and the pavilion dissolves. Causal lens holds strong—because he tastes the fossil, he finds the pavilion and acts. Orientation is clear within 120 words: desert fortress, chef, post-rain. Cost is legible in "an agony that scoured him clean."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful—wet stone, bruised creosote, and the coral pavilion constrain choice by requiring digging and charge the final image with its dissolution. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, like the "faint scent of ancient brine." Spatial choreography is coherent during the discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Kaelen's internal conflict with memory and sorrow, escalating through his agency—tasting the fossil and choosing to subsume the motes. Cost is unmistakable in the "agony that scoured him clean." Pressure tightens under the causal lens, foreclosing his earlier dream with a trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory and redemption emerges through particulars like the tidal pool analysis and subsumption, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Kaelen's peace and the pavilion's dissolution. Subtext operates in gestures, such as the hand on the Warlord's arm conveying release.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, rhythmic prose that reflects Kaelen's mindset, e.g., "the dunes were weeping." No head-hopping; voice modulates under pressure, like in the climax where syntax compresses appropriately. Elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, e.g., "sandpapering his own heart," and clarity is maintained even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates during the subsumption, enhancing momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis—chef tasting memories, coral pavilion—that feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the tidal pool analysis. Risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
