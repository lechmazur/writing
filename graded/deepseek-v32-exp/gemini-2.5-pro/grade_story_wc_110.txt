<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to thaw mistrust is clear and intensifies under pressure, driving his decision to eavesdrop. Interiority is concrete and embodied, such as "the first delicate thaw around his heart." The final choice to share the lens is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the emotional thaw. Contradictory impulses act in scene, like eavesdropping versus desire for transparency, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as they stand together freed by honesty, with felt cost in Lena's tear and the thaw. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, building through symbolic tickets. Orientation is clear early, and causality is strong, with the eavesdropping leading to revelation. Persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, like the "crystal whispering forecourt" and park cenotaph, filtering through Elias's POV. Sensory details are selective and reflect urgency. The lens and tickets as micro-settings constrain choices and charge the final image, fulfilling the 9+ quick test by altering tactics and reweighting meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding Lena escalates under Elias's agency, from collecting tickets to eavesdropping. Cost is legible in the emotional thaw and shared sorrow. Under the accumulative lens, density increases with each ticket, narrowing options. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency with unmistakable cost, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of honesty without words emerges through symbols and actions, not direct statement. Subtext operates in doodles and silence, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. No moralizing; complexity embraces grief and reconciliation, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV (Elias) is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is lyrical and consistent, with purposeful compression in silence. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present, carrying subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "key with broken birds' wings." Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and clarity is maintained in peak beats. Meets the 9+ quick test with zero artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of silent communication and grief through cryptic doodles. Tropes are transformed via specific details like the lens and tickets. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
