<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, and her final choice to embrace her pulse is earned with visible cost in exhaustion. Contradictory impulses act in scene when she channels fear and hope, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost in Elara's trembling and the orchard's transformation; causal lens holds strong with clear because/therefore linkages from the locust shell discovery to the climax. Orientation is anchored early, and cost is legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details like "rustled leaves" and "ozone scent" filtering through POV; the orchard and Mother Tree constrain choices and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ test by shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes are dominant and escalate through Elara's agency under the causal lens; the Wardens' charge and her poured-out music create meaningful tightening, with cost unmistakable in her exhaustion and the reclamation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to breaking free through reclamation; slight explicitness in "she finally understood" prevents a higher score, but subtext operates effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision like "in the gap between knowing" is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and high information density without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "heartbeat became the song's true percussion" enhances clarity and propulsion in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh specificity in the heartbeat method and reclamation theme; risk-taking in lyric design heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
