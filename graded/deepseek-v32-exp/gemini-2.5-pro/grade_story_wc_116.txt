<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses like gripping reality loosely and seeing ghosts. The motivation to seek regenerative silence is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling the choice to use the origami swan. The final renunciation of duty for temporary peace is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the temporary peace and anticipated return to duty. The accumulative drive lens holds, with pressure building from absorbed histories to the escape. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the origami swan's use is a coherent turning point.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (dust, moss, ozone) and POV-filtered specificity. The library and obsidian refuge constrain choices and charge the final image, as the refuge "absorbs all light" and scrubs echoes from the mind, integral to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mental peace vs. duty escalates through protagonist agency—the decision to burrow via the swan—narrowing options and leading to a cost-legible temporary relief. Under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres and deepens with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of burden and silence emerges through particulars like the swan and river, with subtext in imagery. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the protagonist's suspended purpose and renewed observation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in rhythmic prose and selective attention. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and any elision (e.g., the swan's folds) is taught and paid off in the transition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful, and sentences advance story and atmosphere without obscuring clarity, even in peak beats like the burrowing sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of chronicle keeper and origami-based escape, transformed through specific details and emotional truth. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
