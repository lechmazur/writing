<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; his shift from auditory to visual perception is earned through prior causality, and his gentle strength constrains choices with visible cost in the final tuning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost—the redefinition of connection as light—under an accumulative/textural lens; orientation is immediate, and the miner's lens persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The laboratory and key objects like the lens and carillon constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elian's agency in questioning assumptions and building the apparatus; cost is legible in the shift from sound to light, foreclosing prior paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer to connection; subtext in "to see the echo" avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; poetic voice modulates with pressure, and elision (e.g., the clue's meaning) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or artifacts; figurative language is consistent and supports peak beats like the hologram's revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar elements with originality; the transformation of connection into light feels inevitable, and risk-taking in conceptual repricing heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
