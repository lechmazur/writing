<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her unique trait as a gazer of fractured time, compelling her higher-stakes choice to delve deeper into the memory. Her interiority is concrete and embodied, such as feeling the "celluloid cool and sharp against her fingertips," and her final realization is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the melancholic tone. Arthur's character, though accessed through vision, shows contradictory impulses of love and renunciation that act simultaneously in the reconstructed past.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the final image: "Unused love is never lost... It simply becomes the soul of a place." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory details to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the vision shard integrates seamlessly without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the projection booth and theater acting as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details like "dust tasted of rust and regret" and the absorption of love into the "plush red velvet" reflect internal states and become indispensable to the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding where unused love is stored) escalates under the Accumulative lens through Elara's agency in pushing deeper into the memory, leading to a tightening that forecloses options with cost. The revelation that love is absorbed into the theater reweights the stake with undeniable conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars, with the core concept of unused love becoming the soul of a place offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through imagery like "hushed thunder" and the final realization, avoiding abstraction and earning wisdom through concrete experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that filters detail through Elara's spatially imaginative mind. Voice controls rhythm and diction under pressure, such as in the vision buildup, and any elision (e.g., the transition into memory) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language like "silence was a specific frequency of absence" is purposeful and clear, and sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the vision without obscuring causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines through a non-obvious synthesis of psychometry, unrequited love, and place memory, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specific details like filming goodbye letters transform familiar tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
