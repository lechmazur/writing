<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and rooted in his trapped state, with embodied interiority shown through phrases like "the whalebone reverie of his existence deepened." His endurance is earned, and the cost of loneliness is visible, though his passivity is inherent to the character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in "a lonely warden in his stellar-lit prison." The accumulative/textural lens holds, orientation is anchored early, and the persistent constraint of entrapment shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early and escalate through Kaelen's agency in processing the burden, driven by the accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable in his loneliness and the mosaic's growth, with one meaningful tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the transformation of grief into stone, with subtext in the ritual. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
