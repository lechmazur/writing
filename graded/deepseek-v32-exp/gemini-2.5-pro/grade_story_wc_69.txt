<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices that reveal his values. His shift from resignation to expectation is earned through prior causality, and his flawed persistence complicates choices, driving the narrative. The final renunciation of his old method carries visible cost in the choir's transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the choir finds harmony, with felt cost in the release of tension. The causal lens holds strong from Elias's realization to the application of his new method. Orientation is clear early, and the structure tightens meaningfully around the stake of community healing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail, and the zither rosette functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Autumn imagery and the library atmosphere mirror internal states without overt symbolism, supporting the theme through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, moving from failure to realization to successful application of the "subtracting noise" method. The cost is legible in the choir's initial dissonance and final unity, with one meaningful tightening that forecloses Elias's old approach.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as the rosette metaphor, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of harmony, reweighting prior material through the choir's unified hum and avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature in Elias's lyrical, reflective voice. Prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, and any elision (e.g., the choir's past) is taught and paid off in closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, such as "carved away the unnecessary parts," and sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the climax without sluggishness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The concept of "subtracting noise" for harmony is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure (e.g., the breathing exercise) heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity in details like the rosette anchors universals.</comment>
