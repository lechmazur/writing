<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her backstory as an arsonist's daughter, driving her choices under pressure. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like her breath catching and calm sharpening. The final choice to use the thread for grafting is earned by prior causality, showing a credible endurance with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her rebellion against her heritage through unyielding compassion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with clear linkage from inciting incident (radio call) to closure (grafting). Orientation is anchored early by the obsidian lagoon and radio alert. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Elara's severance from the talisman and synthesis with the tree lands with felt cost. The lens holds without ambiguity, and her heritage persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Settings like the obsidian lagoon and fire scene are vivid and sensory, filtered through Elara's POV. The lagoon mirrors internal states and charges the final image, while the conservatory's destruction pressures choices. Objects like the black sand and coin are integrated into action and theme. However, the environment constrains choice indirectly rather than directly altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rewriting her inheritance escalates under causal lens through Elara's agency, from the fire call to grafting. Cost is legible when she sacrifices the talisman, foreclosing a path and enabling new growth. Pressure coheres and tightens with one meaningful deepening. Protagonist-driven escalation with visible price charges the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of healing versus destruction emerges through events and images like the graft and scars singing, without direct statement. Subtext operates in gestures, such as using the thread for synthesis. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of building from ashes. No moralizing; complexity arises from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical yet controlled prose. Voice modulates with pressure, from the lagoon's peace to the fire's urgency. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, such as the taught pattern of reflection anchored in present cues. Rhythmic control under pressure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "ghost ship on a glassy sea." Read-aloud test passes with clear propulsion. Minor overwriting in peak beats is balanced by clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of firefighter/arsonist duality with healing motifs, transforming tropes through specific choices. The graft and talisman use feel inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in lyrical prose that heightens stakes. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, and the premise commits fully to its implications.</comment>
