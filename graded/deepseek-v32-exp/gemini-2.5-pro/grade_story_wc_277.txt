<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Celeste's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final intervention is earned by prior causality, and her observant nature drives key turns without diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under the causal lens, as Celeste's revelation reweights her father's legacy with felt cost. Orientation is clear early, and the structure tightens logically toward the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory and rosewood pen nib serve as micro-settings that charge the final image, with vivid sensory detail filtered through Celeste's POV.
