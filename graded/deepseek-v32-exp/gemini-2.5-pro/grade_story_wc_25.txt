<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and consistent, driving his quiet competence against Kaelen's arrogance. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion (e.g., "smiled faintly") and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice is earned, but lacks strong contradictory impulses, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with cost: Silas's victory reconfigures authority, felt in Kaelen's defeated question. Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraints (storm, methods) shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details filtered through POV (e.g., "poisoned bruise" sky). The labyrinth and storm constrain choices, charging the final image. No generic description; environment actively pressures navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quiet vs. loud competence) escalates through Silas's agency under causal lens. Cost is legible in Kaelen's stripped arrogance and Silas's gained authority. One meaningful tightening suffices, driven by protagonist choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in gestures and silence. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("The walls listen") without moralizing. Coherent and earned through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., identifying walks). Voice is controlled and rhythmic, modulating with pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of geomagnetic storm and quiet competence, transformed through specific details (zodiac coin, key cipher). Risk-taking in style and elements heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
