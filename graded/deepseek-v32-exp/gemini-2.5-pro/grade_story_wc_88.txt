<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in his wiped mind, with embodied emotion like "hollow spaces between his thoughts." Interiority is concrete, and his final choice to build a future is earned by prior causality. Minor detachment in emotion description prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change—shifting from uncovering the past to building the future—with cost legible in the "tiny, fragile spark" of empathy. Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages, and orientation is clear early. Persistent constraint of his past shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, from the grey world to the bioluminescent lake, with sensory details like "cool, damp air" and "pulsing light." The lake constrains choice by requiring navigation to the islet, and it charges the final image as a metaphor for endurance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of kindling empathy escalates through protagonist's agency, such as descending into the fissure and reading the letter. Cost is unmistakable in the emotional spark. Under causal lens, one meaningful tightening narrows options from past-seeking to future-building.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of redemption and empathy emerges organically from events like the letter and lake, with subtext in the baseball's symbolism. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the realization to "build a future," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct introspective voice, e.g., "a shadow he couldn't see but felt." Prose has rhythmic control and perceptual signature. No dialogue, but elision is taught and paid off. Minor consistency in detachment holds it from higher band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and concise with high information density, advancing story through lines like "universe of soft blue and green light." No loops or scaffold issues; rhythm varies naturally. Figurative language is coherent and supports pressure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes amnesia trope with sci-fi elements like the time-traveler baseball, transformed through specific details and emotional depth. Turns feel earned, and risk-taking in the quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
