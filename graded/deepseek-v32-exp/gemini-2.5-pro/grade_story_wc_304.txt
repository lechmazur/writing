<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with embodied actions like "her fingers tightened around the emerald chip." However, the absence of internal conflict or contradictory impulses limits depth, and her competence lacks struggle, though Earned Stasis is valid. The final choice is earned but routine, capping the score below higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orientation is anchored early with Elara in the grotto and aurora. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, closure lands as a Charged Poise with cost legible in "oblivion had claimed its own, but she had managed to save one perfect fragment." The lens holds without contradiction, and the aurora as a persistent constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory details like "cosmic veils of green and violet aurora" are purposeful and integrated with action. The grotto and aurora constrain Elara's method by providing the static source and charge the final image with the softened dance, meeting the 9+ test for environmental impact on choice and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of capturing the spark is signaled early and escalates under the Accumulative lens through density increase as Elara sifts static and finds joy. Agency drives the infusion, with cost unmistakable in the soul's dissolution. One meaningful tightening forecloses options, but no major reversals limit a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of honoring memory against oblivion emerges organically through events and imagery, like the locket as a lotus. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the preserved sparks, avoiding moralizing. Subtext in the final image reweights prior material without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, evident in phrases like "symphony of noise without form." Perceptual signature is character-specific, and rhythmic control under pressure is maintained without head-hopping. Elision in the lucid watchfulness is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences like "She sifted through cosmic echoes..." advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, with no muddle in peak beats. Read-aloud test passes with clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise of a beautician mortician for souls is fresh and transformed through specific details like the emerald chip infusion. Synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking in the quiet, lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. However, it lacks groundbreaking innovation, capping the score.</comment>
