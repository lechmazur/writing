<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Julian's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with embodied emotion like the perfume bottle's weight and his gasped apology. Madame Vex serves as a functional secondary character, though her archetypal nature slightly limits depth. The final acceptance is earned through the séance's raw intensity, with visible cost in his lighter chest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in Julian's shifted emotional weight. The causal lens holds from desire to séance to resolution, and orientation is clear early. The orchard's impending destruction adds persistent pressure, though the climax relies slightly on paranormal mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like decaying paper and lilac, charging the final image. The archive and perfume bottle function as micro-settings that constrain the connection. Specificity is purposeful, though spatial choreography is minimal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (apology before destruction) escalates through the séance's intensity, driven by Julian's agency. Cost is legible in the "raw and agonizing miracle" and acceptance. Under the causal lens, options narrow meaningfully, but the climax's paranormal element slightly softens agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect miracles emerges through events and images, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gestures like Madame Vex's metaphors. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality, embracing complexity in the fractured absolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, such as "gravel wrapped in silk" for Madame Vex. Voice modulates under pressure with poetic yet grounded prose. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though Madame Vex's idiom occasionally edges toward archetype.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences like "a deluge: the phantom sensation..." doing multiple jobs. No loops or scaffolds; figurative language is consistent and purposeful. Read-aloud ear test passes with varied syntax and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of paranormal technology and grief feels organic, with specific details like the oscillator and perfume bottle. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, but the gossip-column exorcist concept leans slightly familiar. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
