<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and rooted in his relationship with Lyra, with interiority shown through embodied calm and fear of failure. His micro-choices under pressure, like the focused haste in encoding, reveal his values. The final weary smile and temporary success constitute an earned endurance with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the fleeting connection. The causal lens holds strong from action to response. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the timeframe constraint shapes tactics decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details (pearl-white stones, mist tasting of ozone) that pressure choices via the storm. The courtyard and bolt plate constrain actions and charge the final image, integrating environment into the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (articulating unspoken needs) is signaled early and escalates under the causal lens through Elian's agency against the lightning-thunder clock. Cost is legible in the temporary peace, though escalation lacks multiple reversals, fitting the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transient connection emerges through concrete images like the ghostly flower and fading melody, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to loneliness through Lyra's response, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, reflecting Elian's perceptual signature. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and purposeful elision (e.g., the graffiti's temporary nature) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language ("pencil-thin beam of silver light") is coherent and purposeful, maintaining clarity even in peak beats like the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of a balladeer interfacing with a weather-system ghost through graffiti is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Specific details like the hexagonal bolt plate and tinkersong wonder heighten stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
