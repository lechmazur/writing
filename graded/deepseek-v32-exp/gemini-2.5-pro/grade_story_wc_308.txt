<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelan's motivation is clear and consistent, with interiority shown through embodied actions like listening and humming. The final choice to guide the pulse is earned by prior causality, but internal conflict is minimal, lacking contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, as Kaelan's harmonic thought aligns the pulse, costing its energy and leading to stillness. The drive lens holds tightly, with orientation anchored early and causality coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with bone towers and rust-colored sky, constraining choices through the canyon's echoes and bird patterns. The environment charges the final image by shaping Kaelan's methods and the resolution's cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the discovery of the arrowhead and the bird-reading method, driven by Kaelan's agency under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the pulse's softening and the arrowhead becoming inert, though escalation is subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of guiding sorrow to rest emerges through concrete events like the bird flight and harmonic skimming, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the contented sigh and newfound peace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct, poetic voice that reflects Kaelan's perceptual signature. Rhythm and diction control heighten pressure, and any elision (e.g., the bird reading) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no major artifacts or loops. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though minor density in high-pressure beats slightly reduces clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of a harmonic stone skimmer and reading echoes is a fresh synthesis, transformed through specific details like the arrowhead's story. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
