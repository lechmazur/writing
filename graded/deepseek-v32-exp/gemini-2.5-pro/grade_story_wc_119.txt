<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "transpose life into a new key" is consistently rooted in his trait of seeking elegant harmony, compelling his high-stakes choices. Interiority is concrete, shown through embodied emotion like "the familiar weight of his unusual occupation," and his final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; his decision to leave forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Elias leaves the lighthouse, reconfiguring his role with cost legible in "stepping out... as a traveler." Causal lens holds tightly from his fortunes to the exchange and his departure. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of his watch shapes tactics. Cost proof is undeniable in the final image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in lyrical, selective observation.
