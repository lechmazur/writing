<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's grief and motivation are concretely embodied through actions like folding the origami from the tattoo stencil, showing internal conflict and micro-choices under pressure. The woman's progression from withering to purpose is earned through symbolic interactions. Minor swift transformation in her arc, but closure choice is motivated by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the shared constellations scene, costing Elias his personal artifact. Orientation is clear early; causality is tight with origami sequences leading to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Observatory setting constrains choices (e.g., curtains of intention parting only with curiosity) and charges the final image with the projected constellations. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of emotional healing escalates through Elias's agency under accumulative lens, each origami figure deepening the woman's engagement with cost visible in his use of the stencil. Final tightening forecloses isolation with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of grief and renewal emerges through images (paper crane, nebula) and actions without statement; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via the intertwined constellations. Subtext operates in gestures and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV (Elias) is stable with distinct perceptual signature; prose has poetic rhythm controlled under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but natural, with subtext in her whispered words.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "grief had been a smith," and closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief, origami, and artificial cosmos feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Concept of curtains of intention is fresh and integrated.</comment>
