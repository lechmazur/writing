<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interior conflict is concretely embodied (vertigo, trembling fingers) and her motivation to provoke conversation drives the decisive choice. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, and the final action is earned by prior causality with visible cost of betrayal. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost ("heavier with the weight of what was to come"). Causal lens holds tightly from discovery to action. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the archive's silence shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "frost-rimmed data-vaults" and "whisper of ventilation" filtering through Elara's POV. The library under snow charges the final image and constrains choice by necessitating the old terminal. Economy and integration are strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens, from discovery to encryption and release. The stake of truth vs. stability tightens meaningfully, with cost legible in her "pang of profound betrayal." No coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth and legacy emerges through particulars like the letter and Elara's act, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of a "blank page unaware," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature ("dizzying quiet," "ghost in the machine"). Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in lines like "Her body moved with an automaton’s purpose." No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "a ghost in the machine" is purposeful and coherent. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of cryogenic archivists and contraband truths feels fresh and specific, synthesized into a coherent whole. Risk-taking in the quiet, decisive act heightens stakes without gimmickry. Inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
