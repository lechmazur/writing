<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is deeply rooted and consistent, with embodied emotions like claustrophobic panic driving key choices. His internal conflict during the corridor collapse and use of phase transitions show contradictory impulses under pressure. The final renunciation of haunting is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his emotional relief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost as Elias releases the ghosts and feels "blessedly open." Causal lens holds tightly from motivation to ability use. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the tidal timeframe persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the collapsed corridor forcing phase transitions. Sensory details like "drip-drip-drip" and "crashing hush" are purposeful and charge the final image of silence. The facility functions as a micro-setting that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes are dominant and escalate under causal lens through Elias's agency, like using the gold fleck to overcome obstacles. Cost is legible in the emotional shift and silence after the release. Pressure tightens meaningfully with the tidal clock.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of remembering the forgotten emerges organically through images and actions, not statement. Subtext in the gold fleck and release avoids moralizing. The ending reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity in "alone, but no longer haunted."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic rhythm, e.g., "colorless vibration." Perceptual signature is character-specific, filtering setting through urgency. No head-hopping; elision in phase transition is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Sentences advance multiple elements, like "fossilized leviathans" conveying setting and tone. Figurative language is coherent and supports closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of spelunking, ghosts, and tech-magic feels organic and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the codex margin illuminant. Risk-taking in hybrid genre heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
