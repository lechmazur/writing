<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. yearning) acting simultaneously in scene. His final choice to map the constellation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his tear and the reconfiguration of his worldview. Motivation intensifies under pressure, and flaws complicate choices, leading to an earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with because/therefore linkages; closure is a decisive change (conceptual repricing) as Elias accepts the supernatural, with cost legible in the final image of the constellation. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity, shaping tactics through the tooth discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (hedge maze and secret garden) constrains choice and charges the final image, as digging leads to the tooth discovery. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV, with the environment mirroring internal states and altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict between rationality and belief) escalates through protagonist agency, with the tooth discovery forcing a tightening that forecloses options. Cost is unmistakable in Elias's emotional response and the final act, under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fractured certainty emerges through events and images, not direct statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the constellation mapping, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication and gesture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and consistent, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., reflection on bone setting) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats like the tooth discovery, without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of skepticism and changeling lore feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the constellation metaphor heightening stakes. Specificity in character and setting transforms tropes through grounded choices, and the closure image is fresh and non-obvious.</comment>
