<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "salvage something pure" is clear and consistent, driving her actions; interiority is concrete and embodied, as seen in "the weight of the tragedy has lifted." However, no internal contradiction or struggle is shown, limiting depth under pressure. Micro-choices, like deepening her trance, reveal values, but the character remains steadfast without flaws complicating choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with cost: the snow globe transforms into a memorial, and the soul's release is felt. Causal lens holds tightly, with Elara's actions (gathering glimpses, weaving truth) leading decisively to the resolution. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the snow globe shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "breath-hollowed space in the glacier" filtering through Elara's POV. The melted snow globe charges the final image as a memorial, constraining the narrative's emotional weight. Atmosphere supports theme without generic clichés, though the setting doesn't directly alter choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvaging pure truth—escalates under causal lens through Elara's agency, as she deepens her trance and exposes the lie. Cost is legible in the emotional release and object transformation. One meaningful tightening occurs when she weaves truth from dream cameos, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events, such as the snow globe's reconfiguration from prison to memorial, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in dream sequences and gestures, like the boy's smile, inviting reflection on truth and redemption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, evident in poetic diction like "walls weep history." Voice modulates with pressure, and elision in dream sequences is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift, though no dialogue is present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; lines like "the borrowed starlight of her work" are effective. Syntax varies purposefully, supporting momentum without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes ghost-whispering and dream-diving with originality, transformed through specific setting and stakes. Emotional specificity avoids tropes, and risk-taking in the dream-ocean concept heightens coherence. The closure feels inevitable, with fresh inflections in the snow globe's reweighting.</comment>
