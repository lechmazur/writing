<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's weary resignation and stubborn motivation to save travelers are concretely embodied through micro-choices like assembling the beacon despite his curse. His internal conflict between duty and despair is shown in scene, not summarized, and the final act of saving a life earns its cost through prior causality. The graceless beauty of his assembly method reinforces his character-specific struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elias saves a traveler but remains bound to his curse, with cost legible in the spent nut and the "treacherous, beautiful armor of ice." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through the impending frost and the beacon's assembly. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph, and the persistent constraint of the curse shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth and mechanical birds actively constrain choices, forcing Elias to act before the frost glazes the paths. The setting charges the final image through the "filigree of impending doom" and the spent nut, with sensory details like "copper-etched feathers" and "subsonic frequency" woven into action. Micro-setting elements like the nut and beacon are indispensable to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as the impending frost tightens time pressure and his assembly of the beacon narrows options. The cost is unmistakable when the nut cracks and the frost arrives, altering his tactics and foreclosing other paths. The dominant stake of saving a traveler is signaled early and deepened through the disorientation of the birds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Elias's struggle against his curse, with subtext in the "graceless beauty" of salvation and the cost of endurance. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the "cracked and hollow husk" and the "quiet, graceless beauty," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Complexity arises from the tension between duty and despair.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a weary, perceptive voice that filters setting through Elias's priorities (e.g., "shifting granite walls" reflect his burden). Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in the assembly sequence, and purposeful elision (e.g., the "forgotten blueprint" as instinct) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffolding artifacts. Figurative language like "a drop of solidified night" is purposeful and coherent, and syntax varies naturally with the scene's urgency. The final image of the "treacherous, beautiful armor of ice" lands with clarity, enhancing the closure effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes fantasy and emotional realism with a non-obvious angle, transforming the caretaker trope through specific details like the mechanical birds and inherited blueprint. Risk-taking in the magical assembly method heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
