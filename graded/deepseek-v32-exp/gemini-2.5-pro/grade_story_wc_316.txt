<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's emotional numbness and desperate curiosity are concretely embodied, driving his micro-choices under pressure. His final act of creation arises from contradictory impulses—ghostly love paired with void—earning the shift to responsibility. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains specific and earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the brain's activation and Kael's felt responsibility, cost legible in the final tremor. Causal lens holds tightly from setup to payoff, with Jin's opposition narrowing options. Orientation is immediate, and the persistent constraint of the jar shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo and temporal static constrain choice, charging the final image with the jar's luminescence. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Kael's perception. Micro-setting (the jar) actively pressures the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the causal lens, culminating in the vivification that forecloses his numbness. The cost of responsibility is unmistakable on-page. Dominant stake (defeating emptiness) tightens meaningfully through opposed forces.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from creation through wreckage, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the newborn consciousness. Subtext operates in gesture and image, avoiding moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars like the complementary opposites method.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with Kael's perceptual signature evident in poetic yet precise diction. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in exchanges with Jin. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Figurative language ("dust motes danced") is cohesive and voice-motivated. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the climax's energy coalescence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of ego death, clone custody, and vivification through opposites, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details like the jar's "DUPLICATE" label deepen irreplaceability.</comment>
