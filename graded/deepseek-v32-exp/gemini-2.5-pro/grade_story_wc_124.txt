<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority that is concrete and character-particular. His final choice to grieve is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in tears, and contradictory impulses (caution vs. seeking) act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with cost (tears and acceptance) under an accumulative/textural lens, held throughout. The persistent constraint of scents shapes tactics, and orientation is clear early, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly described with sensory detail and POV filter, constraining choices (e.g., UV light and greenhouse pressure the revelation). The environment charges the final image, enhancing specificity and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal grief) is signaled early, with escalation driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the climax, and one meaningful tightening occurs through the flower's blooming.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and grief emerges through events and images, not direct statement, with subtext in gestures. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, earned through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is coherent and poetic, with purposeful elision (e.g., UV revealing) taught and paid off, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original premise synthesizes elements organically, with a fresh angle on grief and memory. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight, avoiding derivative patterns.</comment>
