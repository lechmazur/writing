Contradictory impulses of grief and curiosity act in scene, satisfying the quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara's view of the archives transforms; accumulative lens holds firmly, cost is legible in her "tactfully hopeful" state. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the drive lens coheres without ambiguity.</comment>
