<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final act of lighting the orchid is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the foxglove regret. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the orchid lights, reconfiguring meaning with felt cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without contradiction, with the persistent constraint of the cracked bamboo shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory detail filtered through POV. The opal library and glass orchids constrain choices and charge the final image, integrating into action and theme without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving Simple Trust escalates through Elian's agency in lighting the orchid, with a visible cost in his regret. Under the Accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, foreclosing options with legible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of preservation and loss emerges organically through events and images, with subtext in the act of lighting. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic and consistent, with no head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure, enhancing emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and dense, with varied rhythm and sentence-level propulsion. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats like the lighting moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept is highly original, synthesizing extinct emotions and caretaking into a fresh, non-obvious angle. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, and turns feel earned through specific particulars.</comment>
