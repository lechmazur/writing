<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's guilt is a consistent, embodied motive that drives his actions; his internal conflict is shown through concrete micro-choices, such as etching the constellation to silence the sound, and the final renunciation of guilt feels earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as the hum ceases and peace is achieved; the accumulative/textural lens holds, with causality tight from letters to lab to resolution, and cost is legible in the final image of the amber as a tombstone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Settings like the studio and lab are vivid and purposeful; the amber constrains choice by being used to etch the constellation, charging the final image with reweighted meaning and supporting the tone of meteor hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes of internal guilt escalate through Elian's agency under the accumulative lens; his decision to etch the constellation narrows options and imposes a visible cost in the silencing of Lyra's voice, foreclosing his path of anguish.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of guilt and peace emerges through particulars like the amber and constellations without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the leather tattoo memorial, reweighting prior material with emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, reflecting Elian's mindset, and any elision (e.g., past life) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and clear propulsion; minor overwriting in dense figurative language (e.g., "city was a silent, sprawling nebula") doesn't harm closure, but prevents a higher score due to slight momentum drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes elements like haunted firmware and constellation tattooing in a fresh, non-obvious way; risk-taking in blending genres heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable from established patterns.</comment>
