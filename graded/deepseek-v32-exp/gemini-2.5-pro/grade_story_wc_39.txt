<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in character traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion like "familiar, positively wistful ache." However, lack of deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses in scene limits the highest band, though final endurance is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) and felt cost ("his small existence justified"); accumulative/textural lens holds strong from sound collection to symphony; orientation is immediate and clear by ~120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices (loft and dunes enable sound capture); sensory details like "grey silk of the morning sea" are selective and purposeful, charging the final image with the seashell on the music box.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving beauty) are clear early; escalation is driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens, from finding the music box to composing the symphony; cost is legible in overcoming "the sin of letting beauty die unheard."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of translation and redemption emerges organically from events and images; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the transfigured music box without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic with perceptual signature; POV is stable and controlled; rhythmic prose enhances pressure without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density; no loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats like the symphony description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of sound capture is fresh and well-integrated; synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
