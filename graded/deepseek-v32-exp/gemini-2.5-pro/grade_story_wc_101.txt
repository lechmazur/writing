<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation evolves credibly from suspicion to persistent investigation and finally to building intergenerational support, embodied in micro-choices like distributing food and declaring the garden. Her final renunciation of discovering the donor's identity is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in her focused resolve. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a decisive change with felt cost—the community's shift from passive receipt to active gardening—under a coherent causal lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure tightens through because/therefore linkages from donations to bell to declaration. The persistent constraint of sanctions shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting details like the "terra-cotta arbor" and "antique silver bell" are selective, purposeful, and charge the final image by constraining choices (e.g., the arbor as a meeting point). Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's POV, with crisis narrowing perception to immediacies like the bell's etchings.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens, from receiving donations to her declaration that forecloses passive consumption and enables community action. Cost is legible in the labor of gardening and the shift in stakes from survival to hope. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of intergenerational support emerges organically from events like the bell unlocking memories and the garden construction, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to despair through the image of shared labor, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical yet controlled perceptual signature (e.g., "monochrome of want"). Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in Elara's declaration. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is cohesive and voice-motivated, as in "amplified quiet." Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar tropes (anonymous donations, exile) through specific, grounded choices like the bell's symbolism and the garden's intergenerational effort. Risk-taking in the quiet ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
