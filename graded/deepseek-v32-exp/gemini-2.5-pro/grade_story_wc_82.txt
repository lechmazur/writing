<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's grief is embodied through specific actions like gem polishing and origami, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a hierarchy of values. The final transformation from drowning grief to a current is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the climax. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; interiority remains concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost when the dream reveals a "forever broken" promise, reconfiguring Kaelen's stance on grief. The causal lens holds tightly from ascent to transformation, and the orientation is clear within 120 words. The gem polishing and staircase ascent create because/therefore linkages that narrow options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The floating isles and glass basilica constrain choices, such as the "descends while ascending" staircase altering tactics, and charge the final image with refractive light. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Kaelen's grief, with the tea garden reweighted in the dream. No generic placeholder setting; environment actively mirrors internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kaelen's agency under the causal lens, as gem polishing during the ascent deepens stakes and forces a trade-off between enduring pain and gaining clarity. The cost is legible when the dream's "agonizing, sacred moment" transforms grief. One meaningful tightening from physical climb to emotional plunge suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transforming grief emerges through particulars like origami cranes and the dream's broken promise, offering a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in images like "sorrow was a formless, heavy water," and the ending reweights prior material with complexity. No thematic echo or summary in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature, such as "luminous torment" reflecting Kaelen's biased perception. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in clauses like "each upward step a plunge deeper into memory." No head-hopping or register drift; elision in the shadow detachment is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and propulsion, with sentences like "the grief was no longer a drowning sea but a current" doing multiple jobs. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats; rhythm varies naturally. Lyrical diction remains within the POV's lexicon, and closure image is undulled by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes floating isles, mnemonic gems, and shadow detachment into a non-obvious whole that feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the "descends while ascending" physics heightening stakes. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, and the core premise is transformed through grounded choices in character and world logic.</comment>
