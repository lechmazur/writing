<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, driving her from chaos to direct confrontation. Her steadfast attribute is embodied in persistent micro-choices, and the final lie feels earned by prior failures. Interiority is concrete, though emotions could be more deeply embodied in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Elara captures the sound and breaks the deal, under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and escalation is tight because/therefore linkage. The final image of dawn and the recorder warm in hand reconfigures options with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and pressures choices, with the pier and market shaping tactics. The fob as a micro-setting object constrains the climax. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, though some tactile elements could be sharper.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early and escalate through Elara's agency, narrowing options from failed attempts to the decisive lie. Cost is legible in the risk of exposure and the broken deal. Drive lens (causal) holds with meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of trust and deception emerges through action and image, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the captured sound reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures like Eva's disgust, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is atmospheric and controlled. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in Elara's plea to Boro. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, e.g., "metallic tang of unspoken agreements." Minor register drift in "comforting unease" but clarity intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Concept of capturing trust breaking is fresh and integrated organically. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the listening device. Risk-taking in the premise heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure feels inevitable.</comment>
