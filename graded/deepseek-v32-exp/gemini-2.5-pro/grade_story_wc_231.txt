<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's characterization is deeply rooted in consistent traits of solitude and duty, with his compulsion to decode the gesture intensifying under pressure. Interiority is concrete and embodied, as seen in "felt the man’s departure not as an event, but as a sudden, hollow space," avoiding stock phrasing. The final choice to place the boutonnière on the shelf is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his shared isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Silas's "weight of one less ghost," under the accumulative/textural lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear early with who, where, and when anchored by ~120 words. Causality is maintained through Silas's investigations, with no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details like "opal dock" and "nautical twilight" filtered through Silas's POV, constraining choices such as finding the boutonnière in the mist. The environment and recurring object (boutonnière) charge the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake in decoding the gesture escalates through Silas's agency under the accumulative lens, with deepening realization via borrowed memories. Cost is legible in his emotional response and the final act, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of isolation and memory emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in gestures like the boutonnière's placement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Silas's understanding, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical, rhythmic prose like "a metronome for his thoughts." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, e.g., "borrowed memories," with no muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of solitude and borrowed memories, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in quiet introspection heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
