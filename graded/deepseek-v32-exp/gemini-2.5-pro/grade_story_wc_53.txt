<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, and his final acceptance of fault is earned through prior causality with visible cost. The ghost interaction shows internal conflict in scene, and micro-choices reveal value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (acceptance of responsibility) with felt cost on-page; causal lens holds tightly from inciting incident (finding camera wheel) to climax, and orientation is clear early. Persistent constraint of regret shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the kinetic lagoon and Precipice Platform filtering through POV bias; the disposable camera wheel constrains choice and charges the final image, integrating detail into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict with past self) escalates through protagonist agency under causal lens; finding the camera wheel tightens options and leads to legible cost in acceptance, foreclosing a path with visible release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of regret and acceptance emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in gestures and silence; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through Kael's realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a perceptual signature; voice modulates under pressure, and elision (e.g., temporal confusion) is taught and paid off at closure. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control with no loops or artifacts; sentences advance story efficiently, and figurative language is purposeful without muddle in peak beats. Closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar tropes (regret, ghost) through specific world-building and character choices; risk-taking in nonlinear time and kinetic setting heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
