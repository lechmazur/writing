<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear and rooted in guilt, with interiority shown through embodied emotion like "fingers, stained with soil and sorrow." His final choice to offer a memory is earned by prior causality, demonstrating contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the shadow retreats and the tree responds, costing Aris a precious memory. The causal lens holds tightly, with the void as a persistent constraint shaping tactics, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard setting is vivid and sensory, constraining choices by providing resources (e.g., bones for roots) and pressuring Aris's actions. It charges the final image as the tree touches a femur, altering the outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Aris's agency under the causal lens, as the shadow's threat forces him to offer a memory, with cost legible in his sacrifice. The stake in healing Elara's soul tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of redemption through sacrifice emerges from events and images, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the tarot card's reweighting. Subtext operates in gestures like the memory offering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical prose and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, as in the burned card's significance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "phosphorescent moss" serves the atmosphere without muddle, and syntax varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes bartered destinies and inlaying meaning with specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the magical realism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional truth avoids templates.</comment>
