<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in his role, with embodied emotion under pressure.

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with coherent because/therefore linkages. Closure is a Decisive Change—memorizing the equation—with felt cost in the responsibility dawn. Orientation is strong early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the gravity inversion and grotto constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and integrated into action, enhancing tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of vigilance and knowledge emerges organically through events and imagery, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the burden of responsibility, reweighting prior material.</comment>
