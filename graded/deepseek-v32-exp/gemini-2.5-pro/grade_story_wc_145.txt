<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, though lacking strong contradictory impulses in scene. Micro-choices, like turning off the lamp, reveal values under pressure, and his final resolve is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual repricing and felt cost ("His life's work... a joke"), inferred causal lens holds tightly, and orientation is clear early. The frost map formation herald's the event, driving a decisive change in knowledge and role.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, filtered through POV; the outpost and window constrain choice and charge the final image. Atmosphere of "worrying tranquility" is maintained, with details integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from waiting to active documentation under causal lens, driven by Elias's agency; cost is legible in his recontextualized work. One meaningful tightening occurs with the frost map's appearance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of searching for origins emerges through events and images, not statement; subtext in the frost map and phrasebook deepens meaning. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is literary and wry, reflecting Elias's mindset. Minimal dialogue is natural, and prose rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and varied syntax; no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is purposeful, and momentum builds cleanly to closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and inventive, transforming tropes through specific details like the frost map method; emotional truth and risk-taking heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
