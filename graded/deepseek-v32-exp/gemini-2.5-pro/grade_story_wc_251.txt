<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with concrete interiority and micro-choices like cradling the stone. His final action—weaving hope—is earned by prior causality, and the cost is felt in the town's shift. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; contradictions (fear vs. hope) act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost—the future becomes a conversation, legible in Maya's thought and the stone's warmth. Causal lens holds tightly from setup to payoff, with no orientation debt. The magnetic grotto and displays create a coherent, inevitable arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective (cobalt library, magnetic grotto), filtering through Elias's POV. The grotto stone constrains choice and charges the final image, amplifying his ability. Sensory details are purposeful, and spatial choreography is clear across shards.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resistance vs. compliance) escalates through Elias's agency—organizing displays and using the stone—narrowing options. Cost is legible in the town's emotional shift from resignation to curiosity. One meaningful tightening under causal lens suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of quiet rebellion emerges through particulars like the window displays and Maya's thought, offering a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in images and silence, and the ending reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—poetic, rhythmic prose that modulates with pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., weeks of organizing) is taught and paid off. Internal voice remains coherent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("frozen sea," "amplified quiet") is consistent and purposeful. No register drift or scaffold in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of dystopian rebellion through quiet acts, with specific details (magnetic grotto, window displays) that feel inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric climax heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transforms tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
