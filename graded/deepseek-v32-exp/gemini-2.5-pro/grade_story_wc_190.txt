<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to teach silence is clear and consistently drives his actions; his fluid logic is embodied in his teaching method. The passenger's transformation from anxiety to peace is earned through specific, on-page micro-choices. However, Elian's character lacks internal contradiction or flaws, slightly reducing complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with Elian's role reaffirmed and the passenger's change felt. Orientation is anchored early, and the cost is legible in her deepened breathing and clear eyes. The lens holds without ambiguity, and the structure is tight for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the drifting prism terraces and Aether constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as "light striking the prism edges." The atmosphere of "vaulting hush" is integral to the conflict and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elian's agency under the Accumulative lens, as he guides the passenger's attention to subtle sounds, tightening the stake from fear to solace. Cost is legible in her physical relaxation and changed voice. One meaningful deepening suffices for this scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence as comfort emerges through particulars like the storm glass and whispered sounds, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the passenger's transformation and Elian's waiting. Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with Elian's perceptual signature shaping the lyrical, quiet prose. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in his low murmur. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure, with rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language, like "cathedral of peace," is purposeful and clear. Sentences advance story and atmosphere without muddle, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of silence as a transformative force, with specific setting and character details. The concept of "teaching silence" feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in quiet reflection pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
