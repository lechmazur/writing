<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene (scientific detachment vs. grief), and the final choice to join the process is earned by prior causality with visible cost in his emotional shift. Embodied emotion avoids diagnostic speak, and micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change with Resonant Reconfiguration (wiping the pane and seeking the shovel) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with felt cost in accepting messiness. Orientation is clear early, and lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image: the storm-damaged greenhouse pressures tactics, and the butterfly-dust pane acts as a micro-setting that enables his perceptual shift. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with cost legible in his realization of transfer and decision to engage. Dominant stake (internal conflict) tightens through density increase and pattern break, foreclosing detachment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to decay and renewal through the image of life flowing into weed. Subtext operates in implication, and epiphany is earned through concrete experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (scientific lexicon and rhythm under pressure). Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and purposeful compression (e.g., "a quiet prayer") is taught and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, and sentence-level craft supports accumulative pressure without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes scientific and emotional arcs through specific, non-obvious elements (butterfly dust as lens), transforming familiar tropes. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
