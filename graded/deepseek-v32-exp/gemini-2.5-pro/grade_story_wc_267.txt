<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Elias leaves the bolt, a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens. The staircase and memory shards are smoothly integrated, with orientation clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress and snowy atmosphere pressure choices, while the staircase and bolt constrain actions and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful.</comment>
