<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with interiority shown through despair and innovation. Her micro-choices under pressure, like jury-rigging the fragment, reveal hierarchy of values. The final earned success aligns with prior causality, though emotional depth could be more embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Elara finds the shard of hush, reconfiguring her understanding with felt cost in the tension and risk. Causal lens holds strong from her actions to outcome. Orientation is clear early, and the structure tightens coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the tower's height enabling the signal work and the fragment's use charging the final image. Sensory details like "cosmic dust" and "crackling pressure" are purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled with the lunar perigee escalating pressure, and Elara's agency in discarding assumptions drives meaningful tightening. Cost is legible in the system overload and her defiant practicality, narrowing options under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as potential emerges through events and images, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext in the "shard of hush" concept integrates deeply, avoiding moralizing for earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature that reflects Elara's expertise. No head-hopping; prose rhythm controls pressure well, and any elision in method is taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Concept of a "shard of hush" is original and well-integrated, with risk-taking in the method of discarding assumptions heightening stakes. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, and specificity avoids derivative premises.</comment>
