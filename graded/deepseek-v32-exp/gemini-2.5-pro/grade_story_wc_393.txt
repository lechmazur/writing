<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Arthur's interior conflict between faith and despair is concretely embodied, and his final renunciation of his old role is earned through the causal chain with Elias. The cost is visible as peace washes over guilt, satisfying the 9+ test with contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a conceptual repricing where Arthur's realization reweights his purpose, with felt cost in the guilt-to-peace shift. The hybrid causal-accumulative lens holds, and orientation is anchored early without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The music box shop and clockwork heart constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "vibrant hush" and light imagery woven purposefully through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the hybrid lens is driven by Arthur's agency in seeking the second opinion, tightening his internal stake through Elias's analogy, with cost legible in his altered readiness to act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grace emerges through particulars like the light-breaking metaphor and the clockwork heart, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext operates in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Arthur's poetic observations; dialogue carries subtext and goal-pursuit, and rhythmic control heightens pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold; figurative language like "dust motes, ancient and golden" is coherent and advances atmosphere without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The clockwork heart metaphor synthesizes familiarity with non-obvious emotional insight, feeling inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in lyrical metaphors elevates stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
