<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in atonement, with micro-choices like seed selection under bird guidance. Interiority is concrete, though contradictory impulses are subtle. Final renunciation is earned with visible cost in the aching back and lighter satchel.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in "his back aching, his satchel significantly lighter." Inferred accumulative/textural lens holds, orientation is clear early, and causality tightens through bird-guided planting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the jetty and blossoms constraining choices like fissure selection for planting. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, charging the final image of "a garden on a gravestone."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming the dead ocean escalates through protagonist agency under accumulative lens, with cost visible in effort and seed use. Bird calls narrow options and deepen stakes, foreclosing paths without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of redemption and harmony emerges implicitly from events like seed planting and bird communication, with subtext in "submerged concord." Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and lyrical rhythm. Voice remains coherent under pressure, and elision (e.g., bird language translation) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the planting sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic reclamation with ecological symbolism feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specific details like brine-gulls as librarians transform tropes.</comment>
