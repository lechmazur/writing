<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyel's motivation is deeply rooted in homesickness and guardianship, with embodied emotions like "the ice in his own veins." His internal conflict is shown through contradictory impulses when tempted by the pendant, and his final renunciation is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost when he rejects the portal, sealing it with his longing. The accumulative/textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early. Cost is legible in the final image of him making peace with the fog.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The frozen garden and mist are vividly specific and integral, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "skeletal roses" and "icy tears" are purposeful, mirroring Lyel's internal state and supporting the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of home vs. duty escalates under the accumulative lens through the pendant's temptation and portal opening. Lyel's agency drives the climax, with cost unmistakable when he sacrifices the chance to return home, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of acceptance and false hope emerges through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer as Lyel makes peace with uncertainty, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and feral, reflecting Lyel's state. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off, such as in the sleep transitions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story and atmosphere. No major artifacts; minor issues include slight register consistency in peak beats, but clarity and propulsion are maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of feral guardian, dimensional homesickness, and frozen setting feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in the quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the concept is fully committed to.</comment>
