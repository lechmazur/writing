<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's "mournfully eager" nature is embodied in contradictory impulses (sorrow and yearning driving action), with micro-choices like the spectral pulls on the cord earning the closure through visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority is concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory density to a Charged Poise closure where the wife's "pained, fragile smile" reconfigures stakes with felt cost. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the ghost's constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting elements like the "echo chamber tunnel" constrain choice by amplifying sound, charging the final image. Sensory details (e.g., "dust motes danced") are selective and purposeful, filtered through the ghost's POV to mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency (e.g., pulling the cord, directing the wind), tightening stakes toward the wife's response with cost legible in her "pained" smile. Dominant stake (restoring laughter) is signaled early and deepens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of grief and memory emerges through particulars like the leaf blower's hum, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer (the "seed of healing") that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature (e.g., "spectral fingers, more memory than matter") and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., ghostly nature) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language (e.g., "silence so dense it felt like a physical weight") is coherent and purpose-driven, with clear propulsion in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes ghostly haunting with leaf blower conduction in a non-obvious way that feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure is fully integrated.</comment>
