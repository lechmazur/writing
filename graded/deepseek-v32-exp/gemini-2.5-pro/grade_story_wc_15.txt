<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Kaelen's haunting optimism is consistently embodied and drives key choices, such as reinforcing the threads during the storm, with visible cost (bleeding hands). However, the character lacks significant internal contradiction or evolution, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is decisive with the threads securing a transformed labyrinth, cost legible in Kaelen's physical sacrifice and the storm's threat. Causal drive holds strong from the plate discovery to conscious reinforcement, with no orientation issues.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (red canyon walls, dust storms) and constrains choices—the labyrinth walls serve as the canvas for weaving, and the storm forces tactical action. Sensory details are purposeful and integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate meaningfully under a causal lens: the storm threatens the unconscious art, prompting Kaelen's agential response to secure it. Cost is clear in his frantic, bloody effort, narrowing options to preservation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of weaving hope from ruin emerges organically through images and actions, but the final line ("sew a new shoreline...") edges toward explicit moralizing, slightly reducing resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively poetic ("bone-white memories," "orchid solace"), with perceptual signature filtering through Kaelen's optimism. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied syntax and no scaffold loops. Figurative language enhances clarity without muddle, even in peak beats like the storm sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes post-apocalyptic decay with unique weaving magic, transforming tropes through specific details like sleepwalking collaboration. Risks heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
