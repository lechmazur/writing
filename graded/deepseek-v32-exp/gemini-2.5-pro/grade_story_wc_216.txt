<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied interiority like "thinning of the light within his own bones"; his final choice to activate the silo is earned by prior causality, and the cost of his transformed sense of time is felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Kael experiences the shared memory, with cost legible in "the gnawing sense of his own borrowed time had vanished"; orientation is clear early, and causality is intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the emerald silo and urn fragment constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details like "hummed with a light of its own" are filtered through Kael's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens: the message "willow" triggers a density increase, leading to Kael's agency in activating the silo; cost is visible in his replaced anxiety with timelessness, foreclosing his prior path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and time emerges through particulars like the urn and messages; ending offers a non-literal answer via the shared memory, reweighting prior material without moralizing; subtext in poetic exchanges enriches resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is poetic yet consistent, e.g., "a metallic wound spilling its secrets"; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "a river of decay" is coherent and purposeful; read-aloud test passes with clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-Collapse timekeeper, garage sale method, and resonant closure; premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in lyric accumulative design that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
