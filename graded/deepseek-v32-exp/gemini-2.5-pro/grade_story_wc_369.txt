<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris's motivation to discover what trees witness is clear and drives his actions, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. However, internal contradiction is subtle, and the final renunciation, while earned, lacks deep flaw exploration, slightly limiting character complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Aris places the shard, with felt cost in the sorrow's transformation. The accumulative/textural lens holds tightly, and orientation is clear early, with causality intact from sound to analysis to placement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the stormlit tower and labyrinth creating a rich atmosphere. The broken sextant and sorrow shard function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final mosaic image, enhancing thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes around understanding tree sorrow escalate through Aris's agency in investigating the sound and deconstructing the shard. Under the accumulative lens, density increases with the dream-map, and cost is legible in the sorrow's transformation, though escalation is more deepening than tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of giving sorrow a home emerges organically through images and events, with subtext in the sextant and mosaic. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material with emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice that reflects Aris's perception. Rhythmic control under pressure is strong, and purposeful elision in the dream-map enhances clarity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, and sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise of quantified sorrow and tree witnesses is fresh and organic, with specific details like the broken sextant transforming familiar tropes. Synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking in lyric design heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
