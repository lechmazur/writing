<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His final act of defiance is earned by prior causality, and the cost of isolation and risk is visible, though internal contradiction is subtle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elias imagines the stories enduring, with felt cost in his isolation. The accumulative lens holds, and orientation is clear early, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the ember alcove and radio glow constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving stories escalates through Elias's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in his fear and isolation. One meaningful tightening occurs as he completes the transcription, foreclosing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of resistance through art emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in hidden lyrics. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping, even under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, and peak beats avoid muddle, though minor overwriting exists.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Concept of hidden stories in music is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet defiance heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and execution is specific and grounded.</comment>
