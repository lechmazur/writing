<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear and rooted in loss, with interiority shown through concrete actions like tapping rhythms. His final realization is earned by prior causality, and the cost of his solitude is felt. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; emotional progression is realistic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strong; closure is a decisive change with cost legible in the fleeting vision of the reef. Orientation is clear early, and the delayed revelation that he summons the place transforms prior material. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the station's console and the dead reef charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Aris's POV, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding Lena's disappearance—escalates through protagonist agency, culminating in the rhythmic assembly during the environmental confluence. Cost is visible in the vision's transience, narrowing options under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and resonance emerges organically from events, with subtext in the map and tapping. The ending offers a non-literal answer through the reef's vision, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm mirrors the tapping motif. No head-hopping; diction remains character-consistent, and elision (e.g., map detail) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or artifacts. Sentence-level propulsion supports tension, and figurative language (e.g., "ghost of that reef") is coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept of rhythmic summoning is fresh and organic, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in magical realism heightens stakes, and the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with no derivative echoes.</comment>
