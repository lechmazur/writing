<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Amal's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, with embodied emotion (white knuckles, geode warmth) and micro-choices under pressure. The final trajectory of her grief is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive holds strongly from inciting incident to closure, with a decisive change in knowledge (coordinates found) and felt cost (grief's trajectory). Orientation is immediate, and closure lands with undeniable conceptual price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (orbital observatory, ticking capacitor bank) and pressures choices (circuit breakers cooling). The geode crystal as micro-setting constrains attention and charges the final image, integrating seamlessly with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (finding unused potential) escalate under causal lens via protagonist agency (data sifting against time). Discovery tightens options with legible cost (grief reconfigured), and no coincidental resolution undermines pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (cosmic theft of potential) emerges through particulars (geode, resonance coordinates) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal reweighting of grief and pursuit, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature blending poetic and scientific diction. Voice modulates under pressure (e.g., "bleak exhilaration"), and elision (e.g., perturbation theory) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density, no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("deathwatch beetle," "silent chord") is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes grief and theoretical physics with originality, transforming tropes through specific details (perturbation theory applied to trauma). Risk-taking in conceptual depth heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
