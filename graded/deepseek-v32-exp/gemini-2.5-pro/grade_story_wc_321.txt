<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Finn's motivation is clear and intensifies from observation to active resolution, with embodied interiority and an earned change that forecloses his ordinary life with visible cost. His resilient positivity is shown through micro-choices under pressure, though secondary characters remain functional but flat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost in Finn's "permanent transient" state and the restored hourglass; causal lens holds tightly from inciting incident to resolution, with orientation anchored early and no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and POV-filtered, with the spectral grotto and starlight patterns constraining Finn's choices and charging the final image; sensory details are selective and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from survival to merging timelines through Finn's agency, driven by his pattern recognition and radio manipulation; cost is legible in the climax and his altered awareness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of transience and parallel possibilities emerges organically through images like the hourglass and Finn's role, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature that reflects Finn's observations; dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent and advances momentum, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes parallel timelines with a fresh angle, transformed through specific details and Finn's cost; risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
