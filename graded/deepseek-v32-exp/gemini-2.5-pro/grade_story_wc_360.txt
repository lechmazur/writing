<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to understand emotion's mathematics is clear and consistent, driving his actions; Anya's grief is embodied and specific. Their interactions reveal micro-choices under pressure, with Elias's habitual borrowing shaping the climax. The final transposition is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in Anya's disorientation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively as Anya's grief is recontextualized, with cost legible in her disorientation; the causal lens holds from setup to end, reinforced by the halo fragment and press. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of the machine shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The topaz workshop and iron letterpress are vivid and purposeful, constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details like "light like honey" are filtered through POV, with the halo fragment and press actively shaping the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of emotional pain escalates through Elias's agency under the causal lens, culminating in the transposition with unmistakable cost in Anya's disorientation; the press operation narrows options and deepens understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of emotion's mathematics emerges through events and images, not statement; the fractal symbol offers a resonant, non-literal answer to grief, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and controlled under pressure, with dialogue advancing plot naturally. No head-hopping, and elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "vortex of lucid turbulence" is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise of transposing empathy is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable; risk-taking in style and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity in details like the halo fragment avoids template plots.</comment>
