<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority (e.g., "the world suddenly muted and thin") and micro-choices under pressure. The final comprehension is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her profound calm. Contradictory impulses, like the "fold in patience," act in scene, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (her understanding the sound of release) landing on-page with felt cost ("a profound calm"). Orientation is clear early, and the ice-calving sound provides a decisive reweighting of stakes without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory (e.g., "air tasting of salt and diesel fuel"), with the drift-ice marina charging the final image through the ice-calving sound. The environment constrains choice by shaping Elara's quest, meeting the 9+ test with purposeful detail integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (comprehension of endings) escalate under the accumulative lens via density increase in debris sorting and the ice sound, driven by Elara's agency in trawling. Cost is legible in her calm, but escalation relies slightly on external events, limiting peak score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of release and comprehension emerges organically from images and events (e.g., parasol tip and ice calving), with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext in objects avoids moralizing, and the final reconfiguration reweights prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "clipped-off sentences of interrupted lives"). Voice is poetic and consistent, with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping or elision issues; prose reflects Elara's mindset throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with minimal artifacts. Minor overwriting in metaphors (e.g., "masquerading as a saint") doesn't harm clarity or closure. No loops or scaffold; sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, transforming the euthanasia tourist concept through grounded details and emotional truth. Synthesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric introspection heightening stakes without gimmickry. Closure is organic and memorable.</comment>
