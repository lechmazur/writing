<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her lineage; interiority is concrete with embodied emotions like "heart hammered a nervous beat"; final choice to use the eclipse essence is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive holds strong from prophecy to action; closure lands on-page with Orrery's repair and purpose fulfilled; cost is legible in the use of the guarded eclipse essence, shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid setting constrains choices, such as the blinding light forcing eclipse creation; sensory details are selective and purposeful; micro-setting like the Orrery charges the final image with thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of repair escalates under causal lens; protagonist agency drives tightening via the uncapping action; cost is unmistakable in the expenditure of the precious eclipse essence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of repair and balance emerges from events without moralizing; ending offers resonant reconfiguration through the harmony of purpose fulfilled; subtext in shadow and light imagery deepens meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "water-smoothed wood"; lyrical voice controls rhythm under pressure; no head-hopping or elision issues, maintaining coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and supports closure, e.g., "frost cracking and falling away like shed skin."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith and eclipse concepts transforms tropes; specific choices in character and world build inevitability; risk-taking in conceptual framework pays off with organic integration.</comment>
