<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Marta's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion like "chest tightened." Her final choice to teach Lena is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the lost workshop and strained relationship. Lena's feistiness constrains actions, and their reconciliation bridges generational wisdom with credible endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a decisive change where Marta and Lena reconcile and decide to work together, with felt cost in the lost reputation and workshop. The causal lens holds strong, with events linked because/therefore, such as Marta's climb driven by the cryptic letter. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of past mistakes shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cathedral orchard setting pressures choices, such as climbing the ladder to the platforms, and charges the final image with apple blossoms falling on joined hands. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like "apple trees grew wild through the nave," reflecting POV bias and mirroring internal states of adaptation and persistence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, with Marta's decision to climb and teach narrowing options and deepening stakes. The dominant stake of generational wisdom tightens through Lena's challenge, and cost is legible in the forfeited workshop and reconciled relationship. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from events and images, such as "deciduous vows" redefined through the orchard's adaptation, offering a non-literal answer to change and tradition. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, like the ribbon fluttering, without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, like the grinding stone demonstration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV (Marta) is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in word choice and syntax, such as "deciduous vows" and "apple blossoms drifting." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in Lena's flat "You came." Purposeful compression, like the reflective blocks, is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language, like "branches threading between ancient rafters," is coherent and purposeful. Sentence-level craft supports momentum, and the final image recharges motifs without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes quartz-eye mending and cathedral orchard in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming tropes through specific details like the grinding stone. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The closure feels inevitable in hindsight, with originality in the redefined "deciduous vows."</comment>
