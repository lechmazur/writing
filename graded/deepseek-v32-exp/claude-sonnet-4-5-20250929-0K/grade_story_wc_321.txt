<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mateo's motivation is clear and consistent, driving key decisions like merging timelines. His resilient positivity is embodied in actions such as reassuring passengers, though his competence slightly reduces struggle. Interiority is concrete, with micro-choices under pressure, but lacks deep contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with tight linkages: the hourglass running out incites the crisis, and Mateo's agency leads to closure via timeline merger. Closure is a decisive change with cost legible in the ferry's solidification and sideways sand. Orientation is clear early, and structure coheres without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the spectral grotto and starlight filtering through action. The grotto and hourglass constrain choices and charge the final image, but environmental pressure could be more tactile. Sensory details are selective and enhance atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes around ferry stability escalate through Mateo's agency, such as radioing the captain and using the hourglass. Under the causal lens, one meaningful tightening occurs with the confluence turn, and cost is felt in the merged timeline. No coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of transience and balance emerges through events like the hourglass reprise and merged timeline, without moralizing. The ending's sideways sand offers a resonant, non-literal answer, but subtext is lightly developed. Emotional aftereffect is concrete.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "water that reflected stars at impossible angles." Dialogue is natural and advances plot, as in radio exchanges. Voice remains consistent under pressure, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic, with high information density and no artifacts like loops or scaffold. Figurative language, such as "phasing in and out of existence like a half-remembered dream," is controlled and enhances clarity. Sentence propulsion supports scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Concept of a vanishing ferry in colliding timelines is fresh and transformed through specific details like the hourglass map. Risk-taking in the premise heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable. Emotional truth anchors originality.</comment>
