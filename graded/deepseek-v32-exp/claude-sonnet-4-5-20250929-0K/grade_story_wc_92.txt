<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., interpreting Voss's body language) revealing her values. However, interior contradiction is minimal, and the final choice, while earned, lacks deep internal conflict, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as sparks of change glow, implying cost under a causal lens. The blackout and sundial activation are logically linked, and orientation is anchored early without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fort and blackout constrain choices (e.g., enabling luminous paint use), and the sundial as a micro-setting charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Maren's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maren's agency under the causal lens, from activating the sundial to confirming Voss's allegiance. The cost of revolution is legible but not deeply visceral, limiting the score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silent revolution emerges through particulars like the quill as a lockpick and the sundial's coded angles, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer ("some doors needed to be unlocked from the inside").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, and dialogue carries subtext (e.g., Voss's "winking hush"). Voice remains consistent under pressure, though not exceptionally rhythmic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful, as in "darkness settle like a conspirator's cloak," without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise of a silent revolution using coded sundial and luminous paint feels fresh and specific, with tropes transformed through grounded choices. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
