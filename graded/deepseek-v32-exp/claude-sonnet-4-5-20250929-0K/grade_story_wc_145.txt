<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her profession, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., tracing condensation) revealing her hierarchy of values. Her final decision to venture onto the ice is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the risk implied. Interiority is concrete and embodied, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Mira steps onto the ice, reconfiguring options with felt cost under the causal lens. Orientation is anchored early, and causality is tight, with every beat driving toward the discovery. The persistent constraint of the ice shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered through selective sensory detail (iced wings, rusted outpost) and pressures choices, as the frozen lake constrains Mira's drill-down attempt. The condensation pattern functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (finding the river source) and escalate through Mira's agency, culminating in her decision to act, which forecloses safety with visible cost. Pressure tightens causally from observation to commitment, though the escalation is somewhat linear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from patterns and discovery, with subtext in the condensation imagery and Mira's editorial eye. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the final image of ancient ice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Mira's professional bias. Voice is controlled and rhythmic, even under pressure, and dialogue is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops or scaffold; figurative language (e.g., "circles within circles") is purposeful and clear. Rhythm supports scene needs without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of cartography and climate change, transformed through specific details like the falcon's tracking. Emotional truth in Mira's obsession feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the quiet, resolved ending.</comment>
