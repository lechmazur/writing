<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as her precise work with oils and the final capture of the spark. The choice is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the transient beauty. Minor stock phrasing in interiority (e.g., "unfinished quality of youth") prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Charged Poise as the girl is suspended in radiant beauty, reconfiguring meaning with felt cost in its transience. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with patterns in the aurora and emerald chip escalating coherently. Orientation is clear early, and no causality breaks affect the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto and aurora setting constrains choices (e.g., threshold of stillness affecting Lyra's work) and charges the final image with vivid sensory details like "carved ice" and "green-gold light." Sensory selection reflects Lyra's professional priorities, integrating detail into action without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the Accumulative lens through the intensifying aurora and Lyra's agency in using mirrors and the emerald chip, leading to a cost in the fleeting beauty captured. One meaningful tightening occurs as the glow pulses in sync, narrowing options, but minor reliance on atmospheric escalation over active conflict limits a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transience and beauty emerges through particulars like the aurora patterns and emerald chip, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of captured spark. Subtext operates in implication, avoiding moralizing, and the final reweights prior material without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyra's POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature (e.g., reading patterns in static) and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and any elision (e.g., aurora's meaning) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "tiny star" is purposeful and clear, enhancing propulsion without muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level craft supports the accumulative drive seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes mortician work with arctic mysticism in a fresh, non-obvious way, with specific details like the emerald chip and threshold of stillness. Risk-taking in the skyborne setting heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
