<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and rooted in his trait of seeing ghosts and curiosity about hidden things, driven by his daughter's question. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion when he feels the "weightless burden" of the box. His final promise to the ghost is earned by prior causality, showing a micro-choice that reveals his values. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with clear linkage: ghost's appearance leads Marcus to investigate the ceiling, discovering the box and making a promise. Closure is a decisive change with cost legible when the ghost fades in relief and Marcus commits to his task. Orientation is anchored early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The ending reconfigures meaning with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly described with sensory details (flickering lights, warped counter, dust patterns) that pressure choices, such as climbing the chair to access the ceiling. The abandoned circus ticket office constrains tactics and charges the final image. Sensory selection reflects Marcus's professional bias, avoiding generic description. However, some details like the "electric sigh" are slightly ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is resolving the ghost's unrest, escalating through Marcus's agency under the causal lens: ghost's agitation prompts investigation, finding the box, and the promise. Cost is legible in the ghost's relief and Marcus's commitment. One meaningful tightening occurs when the discovery forecloses other options. No coincidence; escalation is driven by protagonist choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of hidden histories and carrying burdens emerges through events and images, not direct statement. Subtext operates in the ghost's silent pointing and the mainspring barrel's inscription. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Marcus's promise and the ghost's fading. Avoids moralizing, but the thematic echo in "cracks in the façade" is slightly explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflecting Marcus's professional observation and reflective tone. Dialogue with the ghost is natural and goal-driven. Voice modulates under pressure, such as when he examines the dust patterns. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and clarity, with high information density and no loops or artifacts. Sentences advance story and atmosphere, e.g., "the dust lay thick and undisturbed." Figurative language like "weightless burden" is coherent and purposeful. Read-aloud test passes with varied syntax and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost-seeing repair technician and abandoned circus setting feels organic and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific details like dust analysis and the mainspring barrel. Risk-taking in blending supernatural with mundane heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
