<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's internal conflict between counterfeit and authenticity is embodied through concrete micro-choices, such as remaking the blotter petal, earned by prior causality. Her professionally thorough trait constrains actions, and the final decision forecloses her previous path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost in Mara's shift from counterfeit to honest emotion, under a coherent Causal lens driven by amber's transformation. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of the grotto shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The amber grotto constrains choice and charges the final image through sensory details like "static electricity dance," influencing Mara's reflection and decision. Setting is woven into action with purposeful specificity, avoiding ornamentation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation under the Causal lens is driven by Mara's agency, tightening stakes from professional detachment to authentic empathy, with cost legible in her remake of the blotter petal. Dominant stake in internal conflict is meaningfully deepened.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of transformation between artifice and authenticity emerges through particulars like the amber's subsume action, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via Mara's revised half-truth. Avoids moralizing, relying on image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a perceptual signature filtered through Mara's professional lens, e.g., "static electricity flow through her nerves like a second nervous system." Rhythmic control under pressure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "cupped hands around flame" is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats, advancing story without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of emotion counterfeiting with amber transformation feels inevitable, heightening stakes through specific, grounded choices.
