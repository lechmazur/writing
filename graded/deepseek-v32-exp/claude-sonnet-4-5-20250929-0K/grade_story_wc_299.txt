<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with embodied emotion (trembling hands) under pressure. His final choice to trust instinct over facts is earned by prior causality, foreclosing his old path with visible cost. The ex-roadie background informs his micro-choices consistently, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (renouncing "confidently uncertain" for instinct) with felt cost in the final image. Causal lens holds: past experiences and present stimuli narrow options. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the grille cloth's recurrence charges the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting details (limestone dust, trailer draft) are selective and purposeful, reflecting Marcus's isolation. The speaker grille cloth and bottles constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy aligns with POV urgency, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (regaining purpose) escalates under causal lens via protagonist agency—his decision to trust instincts narrows options with cost. The Ming vase failure tightens pressure, and the bottle appraisal forces a trade-off between facts and feeling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (purpose after loss) emerges through particulars like the grille cloth and bottles, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the "echo of purpose" image, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature filtering through Marcus's bias. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (Sarah's impatience). Rhythmic control under pressure, with purposeful elision (e.g., past reflections anchored in present stimuli).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("prayer flag," "reverb after the lights") is coherent and voice-motivated. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ex-roadie and appraiser tropes feels inevitable, with risk-taking in quiet closure. Specific details (Marshall stack, German script) avoid template plots. Emotional truth and transformation through character choice heighten stakes.</comment>
