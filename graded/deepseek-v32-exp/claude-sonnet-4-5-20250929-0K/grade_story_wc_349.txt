<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vera's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with micro-choices under pressure, such as incising patterns into absence. The customer's motivation is clear and rooted in demonstrated transformation, compelling higher-stakes choices. The final choice to offer the bottle is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the trembling hands and parole band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the library's shift and the customer's hope. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with patterns of absence and possibility tightening meaning. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure coheres with one meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The glass orchard library constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "transparent fruit trees refracting clouds" integrated into action. Setting pressures tactics, such as the reading grove directing the customer's path, and mirrors internal states through "integrated fragmentation."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (customer's desire for a new beginning) escalates under the accumulative lens through Vera's agency in incising patterns and offering the bottle. Cost is visible in the parole band and the library's rebalancing, but escalation is more thematic than causal, limiting peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of clean slates and beginnings emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures like the incised darkness. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of clouds scattering and reforming, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical syntax and rhythmic control. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext, but minor register consistency in peak beats prevents a higher score. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "bottled moonlight" is purposeful and coherent, though slight overwriting in descriptive passages limits perfection. Clarity and propulsion are maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh, specific details like the glass orchard and quantified absence, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
