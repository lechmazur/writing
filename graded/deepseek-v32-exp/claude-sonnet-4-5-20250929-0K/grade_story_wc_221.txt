<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and rooted in her unique condition, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her earned stasis as the "blessed pariah" is credible, with visible cost in isolation, though internal contradiction is subtle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost legible in her cellular adaptation and continued exploration. The temporal flux constraint shapes tactics, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the observation deck and compass rose constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Maya's agency in navigating time zones, deepening her exploration. Cost is unmistakable in her inability to leave, foreclosing escape with felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges through images and events, with subtext in silence and sketches. The ending reweights prior material without moralizing, offering a resonant answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and rhythmic control. Perceptual signature is strong, and elision (e.g., echoed silence) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and enhances clarity, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of time dilation and personal cartography, with risk-taking in structure and emotional specificity. Transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
