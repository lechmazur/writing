<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply embodied, with somatic markers and micro-choices under pressure driving her arc. Her final stance—holding grief and hope—is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the closure. Internal contradictions act in scene, such as freezing mid-task while practicing stillness, avoiding diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as the "pearl of stillness" concept reweights prior material with felt cost. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the lighthouse and arboretum imagery charging the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The arboretum and lighthouse settings constrain choices and charge the closure, with sensory details like "salt-kissed air" and "waves against the cliff" filtered through Mira's POV. The environment actively shapes her tactics, such as using the space to practice stillness, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as somatic episodes deepen and her responses narrow options. The cost is legible when she freezes and chooses stillness, foreclosing paths with visible trade-offs. Pressure coheres through pattern intensification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the pearl metaphor and lighthouse obsolescence, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to trauma transformation, with subtext in gestures like releasing the photograph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in rhythmic prose and selective attention to horticultural details. No head-hopping; voice modulates under pressure, e.g., in the cereus bloom scene, with elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language, like "hope like jewelry," is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of trauma recovery with horticulture is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight, transforming tropes through specific details like somatic markers. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the pearl concept is fully integrated.</comment>
