<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., trembling while inserting the key) revealing embodied emotion. However, minor telling in phrases like "understanding flooded through her" slightly reduces interiority's concrete specificity, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (shadows transforming into luminous threads) and conceptual cost (key becoming permanent). Causal lens holds tightly via because/therefore linkages, and orientation is clear early. The persistent constraint of the key shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice—the floating observatory and orrery directly pressure Mira's actions and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her scholarly POV, with no generic placeholder elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens, from observation to actively closing loops with the orrery. Cost is legible when the key grows hot and is permanently integrated, narrowing options and reweighting stakes meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sealed awakenings emerges organically through events and the resonant final image of shadows as connecting threads, offering a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, such as the observatory's relearning mirroring Mira's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature reflective of Mira's scholarly focus. No dialogue, but internal voice remains coherent under pressure, though minor elision in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or artifacts. Sentences advance story and atmosphere efficiently, e.g., "The clockwork key grew hot in the orrery's lock," and figurative language is purposeful and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes original elements (spoon-bent reality, shadow awakenings) with inevitability in hindsight. Risk-taking in conceptual integrity heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specifics feel indispensable to the narrative arc.</comment>
