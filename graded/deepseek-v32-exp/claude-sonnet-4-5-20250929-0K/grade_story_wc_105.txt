<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. The final renunciation—destroying the crystal—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Interior contradiction is shown in her realization that some sounds aren't meant to be preserved, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Mira releases the crystal, reconfiguring her understanding of absence with felt cost. The causal lens holds tightly, with because/therefore linkages from her obsession to the climax. Orientation is anchored early, and the persistent constraint of her synesthesia shapes tactics. Cost is legible in the image of tears freezing and the ghostly shift felt by her daughter.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse and auroras constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory detail filtered through Mira's POV. The forge built from shipwreck iron and greenhouse glass is integral to the action, and the setting evolves consistently. Specificity is purposeful, avoiding generic description, and meets the 9+ test by altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens, from collecting absences to imprinting memory, culminating in a choice that narrows options with cost. The dominant stake—understanding trust breaking—tightens through her actions, and the cost is unmistakable in her decision to destroy the crystal. No coincidental resolutions; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, exploring memory's impact through Mira's journey without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—releasing the crystal—that reweights prior material with complexity. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, such as the daughter's unseen pause, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Mira's synesthesia, reflected in rhythmic prose under pressure. Voice remains coherent, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping. Elision is taught and paid off, as in the transition from cellular sounds to the final absence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Sentences advance story and atmosphere, such as "the sound of trust breaking was not sharp like glass," with clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes synesthesia, memory hunting, and a unique setting into a non-obvious, inevitable whole. Risk-taking in structure and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional specificity avoids templates. The closure reconfigures familiarity through lived detail, earning high originality.</comment>
