<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her role as a salvager of stories, with micro-choices under pressure revealing her values. The final choice to deliver the snow globe is earned by prior causality, though her internal contradiction could be more dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—Maya's promise to tell Evelyn—under a causal lens, with felt cost in the "ache of such meetings." Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glacier shrine constrains choice by thinning boundaries, charging the final image with frost and candlelight. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, integrated into action and POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maya's agency under the causal lens, from dream analysis to ghost confrontation, with cost legible in Katherine's anguish and Maya's ache. One meaningful tightening forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging love from loss emerges through particulars like the snow globe, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext operates in gesture and image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with lyrical prose ("borrowed starlight") and perceptual signature. Dialogue with the ghost is natural and goal-driven, though minimal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no major artifacts. Figurative language serves atmosphere without muddle, and closure is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost whispering and wreck-diving feels inevitable, with specific details like the melted snow globe heightening stakes. Risk-taking in blending supernatural and emotional depth pays off.</comment>
