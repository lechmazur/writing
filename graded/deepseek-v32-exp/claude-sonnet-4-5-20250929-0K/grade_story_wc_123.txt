<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marianne's characterization is strong with embodied emotion (pulse quickening but expression calm) and consistent traits driving her choices; her decision to record the zones is earned by prior causality, though minor lack of contradictory impulses under peak stress prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with tight linkages; closure is a Conceptual Repricing as Marianne reinterprets her world with cost felt in the "gathering darkness," and orientation is clear early without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and charges the final image (courtyard's tranquility reinterpreted as data), but it doesn't strongly constrain choices, limiting the score; sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Marianne's agency under the causal lens, from curiosity to commitment, with cost legible in her solitary recording; one meaningful tightening forecloses options and deepens the conflict.</comment>
