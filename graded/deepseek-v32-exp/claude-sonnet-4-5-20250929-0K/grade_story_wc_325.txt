<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her promise to Kove's daughter, with embodied emotion (e.g., "fighting the compression in her chest") and micro-choices under pressure (tracing the gold fleck, using sensors). Internal conflict between claustrophobia and duty is shown in scene, and her final decision to document and leave is earned with visible cost. However, minor single-mindedness slightly limits depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with cost (emerging with proof as facility floods), and the causal drive lens holds tightly from descent to documentation. The tide constraint shapes tactics, and orientation is clear early. Cost is legible in the final image: "the unremembered would have their monument... despite the crashing hush."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (saltwater-exhaling facility, concrete walls) and constrains choices through tidal pressure and flooding. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, charging the final image. The environment actively pressures Mara's actions, such as the race against time.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes (documenting Kove's discovery) escalate through Mara's agency during the phase transition, forcing a key choice to stay and document. Cost is legible in claustrophobia and risk, and the tide tightens options. Escalation is driven by causal linkages under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of remembering the unremembered emerges through events and images (codex, entities) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Mara's documentation and the final tidal cycle. Subtext operates in implication, such as "invisible guardians of connection."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "The facility exhaled saltwater"). Voice is rhythmic and character-specific, with purposeful compression under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful (e.g., "crashed hush"), and peak beats remain clear. Minor complexity in some sentences does not obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes undersea cables, phase transitions, and invisible entities in a fresh, non-obvious way. Specific details (codex, tidal mechanics) make it indispensable, and risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
