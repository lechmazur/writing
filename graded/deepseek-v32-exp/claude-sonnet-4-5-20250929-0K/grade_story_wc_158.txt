<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The poet's motivation to transform suffering into beauty is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion in "reef-shadow joy" and micro-choices like weaving fragments into verses. Her final acceptance of the ache in "blossom armistice" is earned through prior causality, showing credible endurance. However, internal contradiction is subtle rather than sharply dramatized, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure lands with cost as the poet finds peace with longing, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). The lens holds without ambiguity, and the shell's constraint shapes tactics throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the final image of her smiling and beginning again reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell constrains choice by amplifying her voice and inspiring her work, charging the final image with "reef-shadows." Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like the "off-key wind" threading through chambers. The postcard and shell evolve meaningfully, integrating into action and theme without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming pain into beauty escalates under the accumulative lens through density increase in poem accumulation. Agency is clear in her decision to continue, with cost legible in the acceptance of eternal ache. However, escalation is more gradual than sharply tightening, limiting a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through metaphors like photosynthesis and "blossom armistice," offering a resonant, non-literal answer to human longing. Subtext operates in imagery, such as the galaxy postcard mirroring patient spinning of stars. The ending reweights prior material without moralizing, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature filtering details like "wind sang badly." Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in varied syntax, and purposeful elision (e.g., centuries compressed) pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, as in "photosynthesized into beauty," accelerating with scene needs. Sentence-level propulsion remains clear even in peak beats, supporting closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes insomnia, poetry, and transformation with non-obvious ingenuity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative structure and lyrical metaphors heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The shell and postcard are irreplaceable, avoiding derivative templates.</comment>
