<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sera's motivation is deeply rooted in her role and personal history, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure; her final decision to preserve unpolished dreams is earned through causal realization, though minor hairline slips in interiority prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost under an accumulative/textural lens, as Sera's decision reconfigures stakes with palpable weight; the drive lens holds consistently, and orientation is clear early, though the conceptual repricing could be slightly more dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The blooming library and river stone constrain choices and charge the final image with sensory specificity; POV-filtered details like the glass petals and drifting clouds enhance atmosphere, but minor reliance on visual senses limits the score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Sera's agency through comparison of dream footage, narrowing options and reinforcing the cost of authenticity; under the accumulative lens, the stakes tighten meaningfully, though the conflict lacks a secondary pressure point.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images like the river stone and shadow metaphor, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to authenticity vs. optimization; subtext in "luminous regret" deepens without moralizing, and the final image reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature that reflects Sera's role; rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and purposeful elision in comparisons enhances clarity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts obscure causality, and figurative language like "curdling into something darker" serves purpose, though minor overwriting in peak beats prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of dream sharing and shadow metaphysics, transformed through specific details like the river stone; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes, and the concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
