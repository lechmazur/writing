<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maren's characterization is deeply embodied through her role as archivist, with consistent motivation and micro-choices under pressure. Her final realization is earned by prior causality, and the cost of her loneliness is felt. Contradictory impulses are less pronounced, but interiority remains concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost—Maren's understanding reweights the covenant's meaning. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with patterns of preservation culminating in the returnees' arrival. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight, with no breaks affecting closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The blooming jetty constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like jasmine scent and twilight air woven into action. Setting guides the climax, and specificity reflects Maren's POV, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Maren's agency in preserving moments, leading to the returnees' arrival. The stake in the covenant's meaning tightens, with cost legible in her emotional shift. However, the escalation is more density-based than causal, slightly limiting peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the locket and covenant, with subtext in gestures and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the concept of "steeping."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with stable POV and controlled rhythm. Perceptual signature is strong, though dialogue is minimal; elision is taught and paid off. Minor convergence in emotional peaks prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, and sentences advance story and atmosphere seamlessly. Read-aloud test passes with clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of memory and return, transformed through specific details like walnut ink. Emotional truth and risk-taking in the quiet climax heighten stakes, though it echoes familiar themes of preservation.</comment>
