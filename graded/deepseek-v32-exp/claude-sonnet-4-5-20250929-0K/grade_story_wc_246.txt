<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to find meaning is clear and intensifies under pressure, with micro-choices like unbending the pen revealing her hierarchy of values. Her final acceptance of "confident uncertainty" is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in relinquishing rigid certainty. Interiority is concrete and embodied, such as her hands stilling at the signal, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mara accepts her role in writing signals, with cost felt in her release of certainty. The causal lens holds tightly, with events like the signal editing history leading logically to her realization. Orientation is clear early, and the anomaly as a "bookmark" persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered through sensory details like the "wobble in spacetime" and the observatory tower, with the gravitational anomaly and pen constraining choices and charging the final image. Details are filtered through Mara's POV, such as her noticing the pen's bend, and spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding meaning escalates through Mara's agency, as she investigates the signal and catalogs changes, narrowing options under the causal lens. Cost is legible when she releases "rigid certainty" and forecloses her old path. Pressure coheres from the inciting incident to the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of order versus chaos emerges through particulars like the pen and signals editing history, with subtext in Mara's unbending mirroring her internal shift. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through her "confidently uncertain" writing, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical prose like "memories feel heavier on Tuesdays." Voice modulates with pressure, and purposeful compression (e.g., the concept of "contingent relationships") is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or artifacts. Figurative language, such as "history flexed like a poem," is coherent and purposeful, and syntax varies to support emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept of signals editing history through contingent relationships is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the premise heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity in details like the question-mark nib transforms tropes.</comment>
