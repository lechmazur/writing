<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei's motivation is clear and intensifies through her grief-driven actions; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, and her micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the counting of cranes and the "luminous torment."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise under an Accumulative lens, with Mei's continued work reconfiguring meaning; cost is legible in "luminous torment" and the crane count, and the lens holds without ambiguity. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the cranes shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the island's edge for releases; the environment charges the final image with the lanterns and basilica, and sensory details are selective and purposeful, reflecting Mei's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through accumulative density under the lens, with Mei's agency in folding and releasing cranes driving the conflict; cost is visible in her grief and the count, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of grief and transformation emerges through images and actions, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the cranes' paradox, and subtext operates in gestures like polishing and folding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic prose reflecting Mei's perception; rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision (e.g., dream recording mechanics) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or artifacts; figurative language is integrated without muddle, and sentence variety supports rhythm, such as in the release sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of dream recording, origami, and inverted physics; specificity in details like gem polishing makes it inevitable, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
