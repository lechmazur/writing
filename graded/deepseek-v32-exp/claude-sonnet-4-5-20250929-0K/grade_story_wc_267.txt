<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rielle's motivation is clear and rooted in physical and emotional trauma, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Silent-Choir's silence is a deliberate character trait that drives key turns. The final realization is earned by prior causality, though interior contradiction is subtle rather than stark.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost legible in the final image of playing music. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through imagery and reflection. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of nerve regeneration shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the cobalt fortress and snow pressuring choices. The piano bench bolt constrains action and charges the final image. Sensory details are POV-filtered and integrated into action, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Rielle's agency under the accumulative lens, tightening through her interaction with Silent-Choir and the piano. Cost is unmistakable in the climax as she plays through pain. The dominant stake of understanding safety's cost deepens with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the broken bolt and silent humming, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the cost of safety. Subtext operates in gesture and image, avoiding moralizing. The final reconfiguration reweights prior material without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic yet grounded in Rielle's perspective. Elision (e.g., Silent-Choir's past) is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven with subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("snow fell like eternal descent") is coherent and voice-motivated. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the climax, and closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality lies in the specific synthesis of war trauma and quiet grace, with tropes transformed through grounded choices. The silent character and broken bench bolt feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
