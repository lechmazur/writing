<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation evolves credibly from childhood curiosity to adult dedication, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. Madame Verity's consistent muteness and prophetic action deepen the crucible relationship, though her static endurance slightly limits internal contradiction. The final choice to accept the ledger is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from childhood incident to adult closure, with a decisive change (Marcus becoming scribe) landing on-page with felt cost in the final image. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the prophecy structurally bridges the time jump without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The skyscraper orchard garden constrains choice through isolation and silence, charging the final image with the foghorn's absence. Sensory details (e.g., "crystalline pavilion," "apple blossoms fell all at once") are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving emotional echoes) escalates under causal lens via Marcus's agency—learning dead languages and accepting the scribe role—with cost legible in the ledger's weight. One meaningful tightening (prophecy realization) forecloses other paths, though adult escalation is slightly compressed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of archiving emotional residue emerges through particulars (wax shavings, dead languages) without direct statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the ledger's transfer, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV (Marcus) is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control, especially in peaks like the prophecy scene. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven, with Madame Verity's dead languages serving as effective action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language (e.g., "words that seemed to taste of honey and ash") is purposeful and coherent, even in climaxes. No scaffolding or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes archiving, prophecy, and dead languages into a non-obvious whole that feels inevitable; risk-taking in structure (time jump) heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity (e.g., Linear A, Hittite) anchors universals.</comment>
