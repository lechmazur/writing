<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The Keeper's sentimentalism is consistently motivated and embodied, driving key choices; the mother's sacrifice reveals concrete interiority under pressure. However, the Keeper's omniscience slightly reduces character-specific struggle, though it fits their nature. The final renunciation by the mother is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, as the rescue reweights generational patterns with cost legible in the mother's plea. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The brass gear's return charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The nebula garden constrains choices and supplies resources, actively shaping the Keeper's tactics and charging the closure with luminous imagery. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the POV to mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of survival and love escalates through the pod's failure and the mother's sacrifice, tightened by the Keeper's agency under the accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable in the mother's willingness to darken herself, foreclosing a path with felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of generational patterns emerges organically from events and images, avoiding moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the Keeper's wisdom and the final light. Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic rhythm, controlled under pressure; sonar pinging and gear imagery are taught early and paid off. Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot, though the Keeper's voice dominates.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though slightly purple in peaks. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes generational patterns with a nebula gardener in a non-obvious way, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
