<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper's shift from preservation to witnessing is earned through concrete micro-choices like burrowing without tools, and her final renunciation carries visible cost in becoming part of the archive. Interiority is embodied (e.g., feeling the hum, gripping reality loosely), and contradictions act in scene, such as her initial duty clashing with newfound understanding. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression feels credible and flawed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with closure as a Conceptual Repricing via the origami swan's message and her smile, reweighting truth without pinning it down. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the descent sequence tightens coherence. Cost is legible in the final image of her crumbling alongside the library, foreclosing preservation with felt conceptual price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the finale—the obsidian refuge's silence guides meditation, and the overgrown library's dissolution pressures her arc. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered (e.g., "vines threaded through ancient shelves"). Spatial choreography remains coherent during the descent, and the environment evolves causally with her actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of witnessing vs. preserving escalates under accumulative lens through density increases (discovering swan, burrowing) that reweight options. Agency drives each turn, and cost is unmistakable in her acceptance of personal dissolution. No coincidence; pressure coheres from early stakes to closure, with one meaningful tightening in the descent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of letting go emerges organically from particulars like books becoming soil and the swan's folds, avoiding moralizing. Subtext operates in regenerative silence and crumbling peace. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through her vigil, reweighting prior material without stated thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, contemplative voice reflects the keeper's role. Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure (e.g., short sentences in climax). No head-hopping; purposeful elision (e.g., "untold seasons") is taught and paid off. Diction remains within character lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "silence pooled like water"). Sentences advance story and atmosphere; no redundancy or register drift. Closure image is sharp and unobscured by muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar tropes (seeker, archive) through specific details like the origami swan and mineral script. Emotional truth in acceptance of decay feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure reconfigures meaning boldly.</comment>
