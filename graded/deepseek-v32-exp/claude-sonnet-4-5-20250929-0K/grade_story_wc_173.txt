<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Celestine's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices (e.g., trembling fingers) revealing internal conflict. Her transformation from courtesan to liberator is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the climax. However, slight idealization in her flawless execution prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the prism sanctuary's explosion shatters silence with cost legible on-page. Orientation is immediate, and causality is tight, with no breaks; the final image of her laughing conducts the symphony of rebellion reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the silver courtyard and prism sanctuary constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details (e.g., snow catching starlight) are selective and filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defiance vs. conformity) escalates through Celestine's agency in untangling threads, narrowing options and culminating in a legible cost (explosion freeing echoes). Under the Accumulative lens, density increases coherently, though the escalation is slightly linear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of rebellion emerges organically through events and images (e.g., echoes as suppressed voices), with subtext in the web of control. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting silence and conformity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature consistent under pressure. No head-hopping; voice modulates effectively with emotional intensity, though absence of dialogue limits full range.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm, but slight overwriting in peaks (e.g., "bodily poetic grace" feels decorative) causes minor figurative muddle. No major artifacts or loops; closure remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and synthesized uniquely, with the harvest of echoes and prism sanctuary transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
