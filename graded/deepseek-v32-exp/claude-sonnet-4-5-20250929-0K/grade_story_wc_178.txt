<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The astronomer's frugality and devotion are consistent traits that drive her choices, such as using cheap tools and spending her last savings. Her motivation to "seal a covenant with the unknown" is dramatized through micro-choices under pressure, like quickly sketching symbols before guards arrive. Emotions are embodied, e.g., weeping at the end, showing cost. Minor tell-y moments in interiority prevent a perfect score, but the final renunciation of modern methods for kinship with the ancient observer is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with resonant reconfiguration as she finds the clay tablets, connecting past and future with felt cost (emotional response and financial sacrifice). The causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages: deciphering the tile leads to desert journey and alignment. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the cost is legible in the final image of her packing the tablets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, e.g., the palace observatory and desert coordinates, with sensory details like "dusky harmony" filtering through the astronomer's POV. The magic square tile as a micro-setting object constrains choices (deciphering under time pressure) and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve with the plot, supporting tone and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of seeking knowledge escalates through protagonist agency: deciphering the tile, traveling to the desert, and digging under the alignment. Cost is visible in her spent savings and emotional resonance, narrowing options under the causal lens. One meaningful tightening occurs as the prediction deadline approaches, forcing action with trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of encrypted devotion and cross-temporal connection emerges through events and images, not statement, e.g., the tile as a "love letter to the cosmos." Subtext operates in gestures like tracing the clay, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The final image of packing tablets reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "dusky harmony" reflecting her professional bias. Voice is poetic yet controlled, with rhythmic prose that heightens pressure. Minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or register drift, and elision (e.g., shadow-revealed symbols) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, e.g., "She knelt beside the tile, her fingers tracing the weathered clay." No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and character. Read-aloud test passes with clarity, and line-level craft supports momentum without artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ancient and modern astronomy feels inevitable, with specific details like the magic square encoding star positions. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, e.g., frugality as spiritual kinship. Risk-taking in structure (temporal bridge) heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure reconfigures meaning.</comment>
