<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kasimir's motivation is clear and rooted in his defunct revolutionary past, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure; his final reconfiguration is earned by prior causality, though minor tidiness in emotional arc prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a conceptual repricing with felt cost of failure legible in "Failed so completely"; orientation is immediate and causality tight without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid and crystal shard are vividly specific and charge the final image; sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered, constraining choice and enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake in interpretative conflict escalates through Kasimir's agency in devising his counter-argument; cost is unmistakable in his sorrowful realization but escalation is slightly internal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of integrating loss into beauty emerges organically from images and reflection; ending offers a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct poetic signature; voice modulates with emotional intensity, and perceptual bias is consistent, supporting closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear with varied rhythm and high information density; no loops or artifacts, and metaphors cohere in peak beats like "frozen music."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of temporal unveiling and archaeological dispute avoids cliché; specific details and emotional truth create a non-obvious angle with risk in lyrical style.</comment>
