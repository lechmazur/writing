<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her profession and grandfather's teachings, with embodied emotion (e.g., "her hands trembled") and micro-choices under pressure. The final decision to send an unsealed letter is earned by prior causality, demonstrating a moral choice with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with cost (political uncertainty) under a causal lens, as Mira's proposal reconfigures options. The plot progresses with because/therefore linkage from the letter to the solution. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the floodgates' configuration shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The amphitheater and volcano setting is vivid and sensory, constraining choices (e.g., floodgate channels) and charging the final image. Details are filtered through Mira's POV, with the environment guiding action. The surveyor's chain functions as a micro-setting that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency in measuring and redesigning the floodgates, with cost legible in the forced collaboration. The dominant stake (village vs. frescoes) tightens through her actions, narrowing options under the causal lens. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of harmonizing values emerges through events and motifs like the surveyor's chain and encrypted compassion, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the letter tampering and frescoes, inviting reflection through specifics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (technical yet poetic), and voice modulates with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., letter analysis) is taught and paid off. Prose reflects Mira's mindset under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful (e.g., "brass serpent"), and sentences advance story without obscuring clarity. Minor overwriting is absent in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes unique elements (floodgate machinist in ancient setting) with specific details, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
