<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kess's characterization is concrete with embodied contradictions (e.g., "awkwardly confident gait" and barefoot walking as philosophical statement). Her final choice to begin something new is earned by the stone circle's discovery, with cost legible in abandoning the old rebellion. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Kess's shift from failed rebellion to new purpose. Accumulative/textural lens holds, reinforced by the stone circle's hum and message. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful; the spaceport and stone circle constrain choices (e.g., barefoot movement and discovery) and charge the final image. Sensory details (cold metal, luminescent symbols) are filtered through Kess's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (search for meaning) escalates through Kess's agency in discovering the circle and interpreting its message. Cost is legible in her renunciation of old tactics. One meaningful tightening under accumulative lens suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (stone circle, opera glasses) without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Kess's realization about "seeing differently." Subtext in symbols enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "thunderous serenity"). Voice is consistent and poetic, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("thunderous serenity") is purposeful and clear. Sentences advance story and atmosphere seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sci-fi and mystical elements feels inevitable. Risk-taking in blending genres heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details (opera glasses, stone circle) transform familiar tropes.</comment>
