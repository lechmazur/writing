<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's root-bound nature and Marcus's scattered visions are concretely embodied, with interior contradictions like "anxious elation" braiding terror and joy. Their final choice to link through scars is earned by prior causality, foreclosing individual paths with visible cost in the topiary's dissolution. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, though Marcus's depth is slightly less developed than Mira's.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost: the shared dream growth reweights the premise of the eclipsed covenant. Hybrid lens holds, blending causal linkages (linking scars leads to merged consciousness) with accumulative texture (glade pulses, patterns form). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of scars shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cobalt glade constrains choice by pulsing in response to their merged consciousness, charging the final image of new growth. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like "blue grass grew in defiant, unnatural spirals," filtered through Mira's POV. However, the glade's role is more reactive than actively pressuring, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Hybrid lens: Mira and Marcus's decision to link through scars narrows options and deepens stakes, with cost legible in the topiary crumbling. The dominant stake of guiding the future tightens through their merged consciousness, foreclosing solitary paths. Anxious elation modulates pressure coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like scars and the topiary, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer to unity and renewal without moralizing. Subtext operates in wounds as navigation systems and the crumbled clipping as fertile soil. The final image reweights prior material through the shared dream's growth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mira, with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, dense prose that reflects her visionary nature. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, advancing the plot through subtext ("Link with me"). Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, though minor overwriting occurs in phrases like "anxious elation braided together." No loops or scaffolds obscure causality; figurative language is purposeful, such as "root-bound" visions. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the connection jolt, but peak beats have slight decorative density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of scars as navigation and the eclipsed covenant, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in poetic abstraction heightens stakes without gimmickry, transformed through specific details like the topiary clipping. The premise is fresh and fully committed, with emotional specificity.</comment>
