<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kira's numbness and Clone-Kira's emotional intensity are embodied through concrete micro-choices, such as Kira's admission "I don't love her" revealing internal contradiction. The final balance decision is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in their compromise. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are filtered through specific perception and action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from ego death incident to closure, where the agreement to balance reconfigures options with felt cost in the line "your fire melts me." Orientation is clear within 120 words; history rewriting subtly charges the final image without breaking causality. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that makes before/after legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo constrains choice and charges the final image, as its rotation mirrors the thematic balance. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, like the "cold glass" of the jar reinforcing Kira's numbness. Setting is integral to tactics and closure, avoiding ornamentation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (daughter's custody) escalates through protagonist agency, with Kira's admission narrowing options and forcing the balance compromise. Cost is legible in Clone-Kira's warning "if this cold vision freezes her." One meaningful tightening under causal lens drives escalation to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of complementary opposites emerges through particulars like the brain jar and dojo rotation, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the balance concept, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures, such as the handclasp across the jar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV (Kira) is stable with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., history rewriting as "neural pathways." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in Clone-Kira's defensive rise. Rhythmic control under pressure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density—e.g., "vivify" action advances character and theme. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentence rhythm varies naturally. Closure image ("whole") is clear and charged without artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes clone custody, ego death, and brain jar with non-obvious ingenuity, transforming tropes through specific stakes. Risk-taking in conceptual repricing (balance as vivification) heightens coherence. Feels inevitable in hindsight, with bold choices that avoid middle-ground hedging.</comment>
