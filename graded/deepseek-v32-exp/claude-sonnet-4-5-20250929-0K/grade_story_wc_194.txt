<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cassian's motivation is clear and rooted in penance, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure; his final decision to share the truth is earned by prior causality with visible cost, as seen when he "stood motionless in the gathering darkness, understanding flooding through him like cold water."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Decisive Change with cost as Cassian resolves to bring the cylinder to the tribal council; the Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages from intuition to discovery; orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible in the ending image of him carrying the truth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the gramophone constraining choice and charging the final image; sensory details like "vanilla and dust" and "brass horn catching the dying light" are filtered through POV, and the archive pressures the discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering truth escalates through Cassian's agency in finding and listening to the recording; cost is unmistakable as he muses on reparations, and the tightening forecloses options with a felt price under the Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths and legacy emerges through events and images like the gramophone, not direct statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "bridge of intuition" without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is poetic yet precise, as in "sepia twilight," and any elision is taught and paid off without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion with varied rhythm; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats, and sentences advance story efficiently, e.g., "He began to muse on what this meant for the reparations."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of "bridge of intuition" and resonance encoding, feeling inevitable; risk-taking with the gramophone mechanism heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specific details anchor the premise.</comment>
