<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's grief and motivation are deeply embodied, with micro-choices under pressure, such as teaching Senna to "make permission to feel," revealing a hierarchy of values. Senna's arc from trembling hands to steady creation shows credible endurance, earned by prior causality. The relationship serves as a crucible, forcing choices that alter both characters' states with visible cost. No stock phrasing or diagnostic self-awareness; interiority is concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the final image of "curtains of intention parted slightly," reconfiguring options for healing. Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through patterns of grief and art. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality is tight, with Mara's actions leading to Senna's growth and mutual return to possibility. Cost is legible in the subdued ardor and the observatory's symbolic weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The observatory as micro-setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "copper dome green with age" filtered through Mara's POV. It supplies resources (telescope, star charts) that affect outcomes, and the body/tool focus (mourning jewelry, stencil) deepens thematic resonance. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve with the emotional arc, avoiding static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency, with Mara's decision to teach Senna tightening the stakes around grief and healing. Senna's brooch creation represents a meaningful deepening that changes knowledge and options, with cost legible in her "gradually steadying" hands and Mara's "quiet fierce joy." Pressure coheres through art-making and shared vigil, foreclosing isolation without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like "curtains of intention" and origami cranes, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to grief through transformation. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, e.g., Senna's brooch revealing "parts I'm not ready to share." No moralizing; the final image reweights prior material with complexity, embracing ambiguity without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mara, with a distinct perceptual signature in lyrical, selective observation like "stars wheeled overhead... genuinely artificial." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in Senna's whispered confession. Rhythmic control under pressure varies with emotional beats, and any elision (e.g., Senna's backstory) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "mourning jewelry walked the line" is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with emotional intensity, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats, such as the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes mourning jewelry, observatory, and origami cranes into a non-obvious, inevitable whole. Risk-taking in accumulative structure and lyrical imagery heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, and the core concept of "curtains of intention" transforms familiar grief tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
