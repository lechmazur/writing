<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Marcus's amoral calculus and latent sentimentality are concretely embodied through micro-choices like tracing cracks and releasing the egg; his final renunciation of control is earned by the father backstory and the map's symbolic weight, with visible cost as rain erases his design.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (rain after egg release) under a causal lens; cost is legible in salt dissolving and grace "fracturing" through him, and the map constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The salt flat environment actively constrains choice—the crack pattern forms the map that drives Marcus's climax—and charges the final image with erasure; sensory details (alkaline dust, warm rain) are filtered through his POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marcus's agency under the causal lens, from studying the map to the irreversible egg release; cost is unmistakable as rain washes his ruin and he forfeits drought control.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through resonant subtext—the egg as fossilized echo, drought as deliberate ruin—with the final image of grace offering a non-literal answer to redemption without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature biased toward cartographic and economic lexicon; rhythmic control under pressure heightens closure, and elision (e.g., pilot's questions) is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits zero loops or scaffold, high information density, and varied syntax; figurative language ("dense as grief") is coherent and peaks without muddle, propelling momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes amoral capitalism and paleontological nostalgia with ingenuity; the egg release transforms familiar redemption tropes through specific, inevitable cost, and risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes.</comment>
