<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Margot's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. The townspeople's specific griefs add depth, though some are lightly sketched, but this doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the factory ruins symbolize renewal, with felt cost in the emotional shift. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lavender field and factory ruins are vivid and purposeful, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and reflect POV, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes of collective healing escalate through communal drawing under the accumulative lens, driven by Margot's agency. Cost is legible in the emotional transformations and renewed hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of healing through collective imagination emerges from events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the factory's reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, perceptively calm voice that modulates under pressure. Dialogue is natural and advances plot, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet clear, with strong rhythm and high information density. No major artifacts or loops; minor purple phrasing doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of subtle puzzle archivist and collective healing is fresh and specific, with emotional truth. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
