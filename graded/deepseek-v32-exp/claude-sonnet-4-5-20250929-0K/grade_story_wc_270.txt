<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Naja's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final transformation is earned by prior causality, though the plant telepathy introduction feels slightly abrupt but integrated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive holds with clear linkages; closure is a decisive change with legible cost in the transformation. Orientation is anchored early, and the lens remains stable throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and specific, constraining choices (e.g., hot springs leading to cavern) and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and integrated with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early and escalate through Naja's agency, with cost visible in her transformation. Pressure coheres under the causal lens, foreclosing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of evolving tradition emerges through events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext in plant whispers and script decoding enriches without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice remains consistent under pressure. No head-hopping, and elision (e.g., decoding process) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and integrated, transforming tropes through specific choices. Synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking in premise heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
