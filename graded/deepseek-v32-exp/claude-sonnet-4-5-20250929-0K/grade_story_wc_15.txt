<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The weaver's motivation is clear and intensifies, with concrete interiority shown through sleepwalking and waking studies. Micro-choices under pressure, such as embedding stones and sewing knots, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her departure and the transformed labyrinth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing) where threads mirror the map, transforming the labyrinth's purpose with cost legible in the final image. The accumulative/textural drive lens holds throughout, with orientation anchored early and no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The labyrinth setting constrains choices by guiding sleepwalking paths and charges the final image with threads transforming red stone into rose gold. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, filtered through the weaver's POV, with no generic placeholder elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming ruin to reverence escalates under the accumulative lens through repeated sleepwalks and sewing, driven by the weaver's agency. Cost is unmistakable in her devotion and the labyrinth's renewal, with one meaningful tightening foreclosing prior options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, exploring repetition as wisdom and transformation through art, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of tended labyrinths, reweighting prior material with purposeful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and poetic rhythm that heightens pressure. No head-hopping; elision in sleepwalking is taught and paid off at closure. Voice remains coherent under stress, with no register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with clear propulsion in key beats like the circuit completion. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of weaving and sleepwalking to transform a labyrinth, with risk-taking in structure that heightens stakes. Specific details feel inevitable in hindsight, and the concept is fully committed without gimmickry.</comment>
