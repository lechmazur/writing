<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Maya's characterization is deeply rooted in consistent traits of uncertainty and desperation, with embodied emotions like trembling fingers and burning lungs. Her micro-choices under pressure, such as persistently matching pockmarks, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final earned certainty and renewed purpose are motivated by prior causality and cost, including near-drowning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the statue's golden map reconfigures Maya's understanding, driven by a hybrid causal-accumulative lens. The cost is legible in her seared throat and darkening vision. Orientation is anchored early, and the structure coheres with a single shard transition, maintaining pressure throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The acid sea and floating workshop constrict choices through urgency and decay, with sensory details like grinding gears and sulfur smell. The statue and charm function as micro-settings that charge the final image, influencing Maya's tactics and the closure's luminous map.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes of survival and meaning escalate through Maya's agency under the hybrid lens, with oxygen debt tightening options. The cost is unmistakable in her near-drowning and poisoned air, forcing a trade-off that deepens the dominant stake and leads to transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of kintsugi emerges organically through Grandma's advice and the statue's transformation, offering a non-literal answer to loss. Subtext operates in golden veins and memory quilting, resisting moralizing for resonant ambiguity in the final image of luminous scars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and limited to Maya, with a distinct perceptual signature of urgency and alchemical focus. Voice modulates under pressure through poetic yet grounded diction, such as "gears grinding" and "golden pulse," without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with varied sentence structures and strong verbs. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language like "pockmarks like a star chart" enhances clarity without muddle, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes acid sea apocalypse with kintsugi philosophy in a non-obvious way, transformed through specific details like the charm and pockmarks. Risk-taking in lyric elements heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
