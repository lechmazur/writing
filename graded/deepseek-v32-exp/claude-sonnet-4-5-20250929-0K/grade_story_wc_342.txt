<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Artist's face blindness and tactile method are concretely embodied; micro-choices under pressure (tracing coin, adding stars) reveal hierarchy of values; final endurance forecloses perfection with visible cost, earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a conceptual repricing (adding stars reweights limits) with cost legible in "still unable to recognize"; orientation anchors early; persistent constraint (face blindness) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tree trunk library and demolition deadline pressure choices; sensory detail (touch, starlight) is selective and POV-filtered; micro-setting (coin, canvas) constrains action and charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (portrait completion) tightens via agency-driven realization that precision isn't enough; cost is felt in renunciation and unresolved blindness; escalation under accumulative lens deepens stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (limits define more than gifts) emerges organically from particulars; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through star reflection image; subtext in touch versus sight avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature (touch-based observation); voice coherent under pressure; purposeful compression (e.g., "fractally precise") taught and paid off; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has varied rhythm and high density; no loops or scaffold; figurative language ("stars fractaling") serves clarity and momentum; peak beats avoid muddle with clean propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes face blindness and artistic precision with non-obvious depth; turns feel inevitable; risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry; specific details anchor universals.</comment>
