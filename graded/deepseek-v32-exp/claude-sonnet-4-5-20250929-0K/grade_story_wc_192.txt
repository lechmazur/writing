<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The girl's internal conflict and transformation are earned, though her rapid shift borders on tidy resolution. The final choice to teach burning bridges has visible cost in the scars and sanctuary imagery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the girl learning to exhale and the threshold sealing. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pattern breaks in the fading threshold and scar imagery tightening stakes. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality is intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ashen sanctuary constrains choices and charges the final image, with selective sensory details (e.g., "blackened pillars," "charcoal remains") filtered through POV. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the setting pressures the narrative arc, embodying the theme of emptiness holding necessity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of personal liberation escalates under the Accumulative lens through the girl's agency and Mara's guidance. Cost is legible in the scars and the burning bridges metaphor, narrowing options with a meaningful deepening that reweights the stake at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of self-liberation emerges through concrete images and actions, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the sanctuary and exhalation metaphor, avoiding moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the silent doorknocker and scar meeting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic diction and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. No head-hopping; elision in the threshold dissolution is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, e.g., "sanctuary stood like a confession in ash." No loops or scaffold; sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of sanctuary and self-liberation tropes through specific, grounded choices. The concept of "suffocating breathe" is transformed with emotional truth, and risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
