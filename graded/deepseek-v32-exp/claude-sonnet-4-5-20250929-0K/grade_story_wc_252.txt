<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira and Kael exhibit concrete interiority and embodied emotions, with micro-choices under pressure revealing their hierarchies of values. The final decision to detach is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in forsaking duties. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as Kael's combative tenderness and Mira's graceful servitude versus longing for freedom. Minor swiftness in Kael's transformation prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a decisive change with felt cost—leaving responsibilities for freedom—under a consistent causal lens. The scrimshaw discovery and whale's call create because/therefore linkages that narrow options. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of societal roles shapes tactics. No causality breaks or teleporting props.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with the sublittoral fringe symbolizing transition and the scrimshaw acting as a key object. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's POV. The whale's call and dock environment pressure decisions, but slightly over-reliance on visual imagery prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, with the whale's call and scrimshaw map tightening stakes from duty to freedom. Cost is legible in their renunciation of anchors. One meaningful deepening occurs when Kael confesses his longing, forcing a trade-off. No coincidental resolutions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of embracing true nature emerges through particulars like the Tide Dancer motif and disappearing island, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of sailing toward horizons. Subtext operates in gestures and silences, such as their joined hands on the scrimshaw.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV from Mira is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic yet grounded in labor. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit, as in Kael's defensive raw-ness. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, but minor ornate phrasing in peak beats slightly limits elevation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "bioluminescence in dark water" is coherent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the whale's call, though a slight purple tinge in descriptions prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines through specific synthesis of the disappearing island and Tide Dancer concepts, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed via grounded character choices and emotional truth. Risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure reconfigures meaning.</comment>
