<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and rooted in post-surgery change, with embodied interiority showing contradictory impulses (fear vs. solace). Her final choice to stay and volunteer is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in her embrace of dissolution. The parasol's evolving use deepens character under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost—Vera's realization that change is about listening to life—under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the hum as a persistent constraint shapes tactics. Cost is unmistakable in the final image of her gripping the parasol smoother.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective (e.g., "salt and diesel," "drift ice"), with the marina and parasol constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details reflect POV bias, and environment pressures Vera's understanding of endings without generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding endings) escalates under accumulative lens through Vera's agency in volunteering and conversations. Cost is legible in her decision to postpone consultation and stay, foreclosing other paths. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars (parasol, hum) without moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer in the final realization. Subtext operates in imagery and implication, and the ending reweights prior material with emotional honesty against sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (e.g., with Dr. Henriksen), and elision is taught and paid off. Voice remains coherent without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent, with clear propulsion in peak beats (e.g., "like holding water"). Sentence-level craft supports momentum and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in fresh synthesis of mortality themes through specific details (parasol, hum) and accumulative structure. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
