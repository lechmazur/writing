<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kenji's motivation to harness the ephemeral is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal his values. His shift from resisting to embracing change is earned through prior causality, and the backstory with his grandmother adds depth without flattening momentum. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the acceptance of the moon's departure, under a causal drive lens that holds. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the plot escalates through because/therefore linkages from tremors to Kenji's adaptation. The final image of the moon receding charges the ending with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The lunar observatory setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details filtered through Kenji's POV. The spinning clock hand and tremors are integrated into action, shaping tactics and atmosphere. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details like "titanium struts" and "alpine light" are purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kenji's agency under the causal lens, moving from resistance to adaptation, with cost legible in the "bittersweet recognition" of loss. The dominant stake (capturing change vs. preserving stasis) tightens through his restructuring, foreclosing old options. No coincidence or static conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of ephemerality and acceptance emerges through concrete images and events, like the spinning clock hand and moon's decay, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of "capturing light across the growing distance." Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Kenji's professional lexicon and lyrical rhythm. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. No head-hopping or register drift; elision (e.g., grandmother's lesson) is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "clockwork heart" is coherent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene urgency, and the final line resonates without muddle. Minor overwriting in peak beats is negligible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise of the moon's orbital decay offers a fresh angle, synthesized with character-specific detail through Kenji's expertise. Tropes are transformed via grounded choices, and the closure feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical tone heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
