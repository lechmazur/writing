<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and rooted in her acoustic perception, driving her to play unfinished pieces; her interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, though some feelings lean abstract. The final choice to pass the bowl and the realization about incompleteness is earned, with visible cost in the shifted silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as the fruit drop reconfigures meaning; the accumulative lens holds, with the chronic hush as a persistent constraint. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the living quiet.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting vividly pressures choices (wading, sound resonance in greenhouse) and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, with the environment constraining tactics and enriching atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (finding beauty against the hush), escalation driven by Maya's agency in playing music, leading to a shift in silence; cost is felt in the emotional reconfiguration, under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in incompleteness emerges organically from events and images; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the fruit drop, avoiding moralizing and embracing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice; perceptual signature is strong in acoustic focus, and rhythmic control under pressure supports the accumulative drive without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats, supporting momentum and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic hope and acoustic focus; originality lies in emotional specificity and risk-taking with quiet resolution, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
