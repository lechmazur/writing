<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Moth's motivation to articulate unspoken needs is clear and consistent, driving her actions with embodied emotion under pressure. Her interiority is concrete, such as her "driftingly alert awareness" masking precision, and the final choice to help the ghost earns credibility through prior causality. However, some emotional descriptions lean slightly toward stock phrasing (e.g., "pulsed with something like gratitude"), slightly reducing specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, as Moth's communication reweights the ghost's isolation with felt cost ("no longer quite so alone"). The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and orientation is clear within 120 words. The ghost's thank you in the final image charges the ending with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated, with the misty courtyard and flower press constraining choices and charging the closure. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, such as "stone met vapor in endless embrace," and the environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism. The courtyard's role as a network node directly shapes the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Moth's agency, as her painting intensifies the ghost's emotional stakes, narrowing options toward connection. The cost is legible in the ghost's loneliness and subsequent gratitude, foreclosing isolation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the mural encodes the ghost's needs, reweighting the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of communication and isolation emerges organically through particulars like the graffiti and ghost's coded presence, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the ghost's response and Moth's new ballad, reweighting prior material with complexity. Subtext operates in implication, such as the ghost's "thank you in the language of electricity and light."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with Moth's perceptual signature filtering details through her poetic sensibility. Voice controls rhythm and diction under pressure, as in "her tinkersong wonder infusing every brushstroke." No head-hopping; purposeful elision (e.g., the ghost's origin) serves closure without confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, though minor template cadence appears in phrases like "lightning split the sky... thunder finally arrived." No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a balladeer communicating with a ghost through encoded graffiti is fresh and non-obvious, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the core premise transforms familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic.</comment>
