<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her grandmother's wisdom and her own dissatisfaction with the system. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like feeling the "hollowness" in dishes, and her final choice to share the fruit is earned by prior causality. The closure shows a meaningful change from personal tending to active rebellion, with visible cost in the authorities' notice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with clear orientation early on. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as seeds spread and the girl tastes the fruit, charging the final image with cost (authorities' notice but irreversible change). The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and the persistent constraint of banned seeds shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse constrains choices (secret planting) and charges the final image of "rust and regeneration." Sensory details are vivid and selective, filtered through Mara's POV, with the setting evolving from neglect to growth. Micro-setting as the tree itself alters tactics and symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of freedom vs. control escalates through Mara's agency: planting, sharing, and pruning drive the rebellion. Cost is legible in the risk of authorities and the transformation of communities. Under the causal lens, one meaningful tightening occurs as seeds spread, foreclosing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory as freedom emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the girl's experience and Mara's pruning, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the "stored starlight."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled, modulating with emotional intensity. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., synaptic plasticity) is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts. Sentences advance story and atmosphere efficiently; figurative language is purposeful and coherent. Read-aloud test passes with varied syntax and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes memory-tasting, rebellion, and celestial elements with freshness and specificity. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in quiet rebellion heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
