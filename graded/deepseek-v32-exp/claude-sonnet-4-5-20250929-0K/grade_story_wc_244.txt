<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply rendered with clear motivation rooted in loneliness and professionalism; her final choice to stay with the group is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in foreclosing her solitary path. Interiority is concrete, such as her dialogue with the moon rock, and emotions are embodied without diagnostic speak. The attribute "desperately jocular" is shown through her laugh, constraining emotional deflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal drive lens with coherent linkages: the moon rock arrival incites Emil's finding, leading to group formation and closure where combining fragments reconfigures their approach to loneliness. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in their decision to "stay found." Orientation is clear early, and no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with the ivy-covered station serving as a micro-setting that charges the final image by becoming their permanent anchor. Sensory details like "ivy that crept through broken windows" are purposeful and filtered through Mara's POV. However, it does not heavily constrain choices, limiting the score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes of loneliness vs. connection escalate under a causal lens through protagonist agency, as Mara and others choose to combine fragments and build a network. Cost is on-page in their renunciation of solitary movement. One meaningful tightening occurs when the fragments shift their understanding, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocity and loneliness emerges organically through events and images, such as the moon rocks redefined as "permission." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures like the combined fragments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mara, with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic yet controlled prose. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in Emil's introduction. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure, with purposeful compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variation without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language, like "nature reclaiming its due," is purposeful and clear. Sentences advance story and atmosphere seamlessly, with no artifacts obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes disaster relief and loneliness through a fresh, non-obvious angle, with the moon rocks as catalyst feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure (rumor chains) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
