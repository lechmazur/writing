<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure, such as her shaken hands from absorbed anger. Her final reconstitution of Thomas's purpose is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the changed shadows. However, contradictory impulses are not fully dramatized in scene, limiting the peak score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Maren's shadows change texture, under a causal lens where her mirror use leads to a decisive change. The orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the crystal fragment shapes tactics. The cost is legible in the final image of starlight-shot shadows.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The vintage mirrors constrain choice by enabling Maren's insight, charging the final image with reweighted meaning. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like the "impossible blossoms" reflecting choice. The lighthouse orchard atmosphere is vivid but less directly pressuring than the mirrors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maren's agency under the causal lens, as her use of the fragment and mirrors deepens stakes to uncover the Astrid secret. Cost is legible in her altered state and the foreclosed path of standard methods. One meaningful tightening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images like the crystal prism and weighted breath, offering a resonant answer on choice without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material through the blossoms reflecting remembrance, avoiding abstraction. Subtext operates in glimpses of past moments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Maren, with a distinct perceptual signature in lyrical, selective noticing. Rhythm controls pressure, as in "the glimpses came faster." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language, like "shadows clung like oil on water," is coherent and voice-motivated. Peak beats remain clear without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of peacekeeper magic with emotional architecture, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in magical realism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the core premise is transformed through specific detail.</comment>
