<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Miriam's characterization is deeply rooted in her backstory and current role, with clear motivations and interiority shown through micro-choices like studying dust patterns. Her final decision to preserve the story is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her enduring heartbreak. However, some emotional states are summarized rather than fully embodied in peak beats, slightly reducing immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Plot follows an accumulative/textural lens, building through dust patterns and file discoveries to a resonant reconfiguration closure. Orientation is clear early, and closure lands with cost as Miriam's decision to bear witness forecloses her passivity, felt in the button's weight and her broken heart. The lens holds without ambiguity, and the cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the file room's decay and dust patterns constraining Miriam's choice by leading her to the hidden file. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, charging the final image where the room symbolizes accumulated neglect and hope. The environment actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes center on uncovering lost histories, escalating through Miriam's agency in discovering the file and letters, under the accumulative lens. A meaningful deepening occurs as she reads Samuel's persistence, narrowing options to her decisive act of preservation. Cost is visible in the irreversible separation and her emotional response, though the escalation relies slightly on discovery over active conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of small kindnesses and bearing witness emerges organically from particulars like the button and teacher's notes, without moralizing. Subtext operates in dust patterns and echoed losses, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Miriam's actions. Complexity embraces both loss and survival, with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, literary voice reflective of Miriam's perception; syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional pressure. No head-hopping or elision issues; perceptual signature is strong in details like "dust rise in a thin column." Dialogue is absent, so not evaluated, but internal voice remains coherent and specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density and varied sentence rhythm that supports momentum. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle; lines like "the dust had settled thicker in some places" do multiple jobs. Read-aloud test passes, and closure image is sharp with "feeling its weight."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality lies in the specific synthesis of historical archive work with personal grief, transforming tropes through grounded details like the brass button and dust patterns. The non-obvious angle on emancipation cases feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
