<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Carta's motivation is clear and rooted in obsession, driving key choices; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, though some peaks like "somber marvel" lean slightly abstract. The final understanding is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her transformed perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Carta traces constellations, reweighting horizons with cost; causal lens holds tightly from descent to revelation, and orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices; the benthic city's luminescent depth and the chain link as micro-setting constrain tactics and charge the final image of starlight navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Carta's agency, from curiosity to active learning; the chain link interaction tightens options, and cost is legible in her foreclosed simpler geometries.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through edge geometry and unfolded horizons; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image of shared navigation, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct with a lyrical, professional perceptual signature; POV is stable, and dialogue with Current-Through-Stones carries subtext and advances plot naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts, and figurative language like "water-memories" enhances clarity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality is high with a fresh synthesis of deep-sea aliens and navigation physics; the premise feels inevitable, and risk-taking in conceptual depth heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
