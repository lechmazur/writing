<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is concrete and consistent, with embodied emotion (trembling hands from exhaustion) and micro-choices under pressure (bartering, forging). Her quiet determination drives key turns, and the closure shows earned endurance with visible cost (silk spent). However, minor lack of contradictory impulses in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with clear because/therefore linkages; closure is a decisive change (trees reviving) with felt cost (silk's memories spent). Orientation is anchored early, and the magician's involvement tightens options. The persistent constraint of the silk shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (floating rock arches, mine shafts) and pressures choices (dying orchards force action). The environment constrains tactics (using mines for conduits) and charges the final image (arches framing hope). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving the planet) escalates under causal lens through Mira's agency (bartering, forging conduits). Cost is legible on-page (silk faded, effort spent). One meaningful tightening occurs when the trees revive, foreclosing abandonment as an option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (resilience, memory) emerges through events and images (silk's memories, revived trees) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to survival, reweighting prior material through the planet's renewal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (Mira's quiet observation). Voice is controlled and rhythmic, with purposeful compression (e.g., "working in the timeframe between understanding and confusion"). Dialogue, when present, is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and supports pressure (e.g., "floating stone arches drifted like sleeping giants"). Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh, specific details (crystallized sap, bartered awakenings). Risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The solution feels inevitable in hindsight, grounded in character and world logic.</comment>
