<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority shown through precise actions. The final demonstration feels earned by prior causality, though minor lack of contradictory impulses keeps it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual cost via the recalibration demand, and the causal lens holds tightly from tracking to revelation. The persistent constraint of sideways time shapes tactics and the final image, making the ending indispensable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices, such as the magnetic nexus enabling the key demonstration. The station's "icy warmth" and twilight atmosphere charge the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the causal lens, from tracking anomalies to the lever-pull demonstration. Cost is legible in the need to recalibrate everything, foreclosing prior assumptions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the discovery of sideways time, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to linear time's illusion. Subtext in the Ephemera's existence deepens without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature blending mechanical and scientific lexicon. Dialogue advances plot naturally, though minor convergence in emotional peaks prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "crystalline facets" enhances clarity without muddle, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes sideways time and silicon-based life with originality, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in conceptual repricing heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
