<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies through embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure; her final realization is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her artistic shift, though Father Benedict's secondary role is functional but not deeply crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early; accumulative/textural lens holds with coherent causality; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with legible cost in Mara's new purpose, shaped by persistent constraints like the postcards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory-specific, with the amber pavilion and cathedral windows constraining choices and charging the final image; details are purposefully integrated through POV filter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake in understanding beauty escalates through protagonist agency in dialogue; cost is legible in Mara's foreclosed old perspective, tightening under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars like the flowers and windows, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext deepens via imagery and dialogue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with no head-hopping or register shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats, supporting propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar themes through specific details like postcards and cathedral windows; risk-taking in quiet, reflective style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
