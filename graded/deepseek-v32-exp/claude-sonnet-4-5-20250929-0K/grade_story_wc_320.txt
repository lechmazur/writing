<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her professional disillusionment, with concrete interiority shown through her actions and micro-choices. Her final shift to detecting silence is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her renewed purpose. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; emotional embodiment is strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where silence is revalued as potential, with cost legible in Mira's transformed work. Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, driven by her perspective shift. Orientation is clear early; structure is coherent with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices (e.g., climbing the spire, navigating debris). Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, charging the final image of the city as chrysalis. Atmosphere supports theme without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (search for meaning) escalates through Mira's agency in discarding assumptions, leading to a pivotal choice with cost in her altered methods. Under accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, foreclosing old paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of beginnings in endings emerges organically through events and images like the shard of hush. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in silence as canvas deepens reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet consistent, reflecting Mira's expertise. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., silence as message) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats. Sentences advance story with concision and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes celestial interpretation and philosophical themes with freshness; tropes are transformed through specific details like the shard of hush. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
