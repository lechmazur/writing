<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and an earned change when she realizes joy is method not subject. Her laugh and subsequent painting decision show micro-choices under pressure, and the final stance is credible with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where Mara reweights joy as inherent in the fog, with cost legible in her smile and imagined mural. Accumulative lens holds, orientation is clear early, and the fragment's insight drives the turn without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, pressuring Mara's art through the fog and charging the final image with luminescence. Sensory details like "cracked like exposed film" are selective and purposeful, constraining choices and reconfiguring meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake in creating meaningful art escalates through Mara's agency: her frustration, fragment study, and realization tighten options. Cost is felt in her hollow prior work and new commitment, under accumulative lens with one meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of joy within persistence emerges through images and events, not statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in "living inside joy all along," with earned epiphany from concrete particulars and no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature focused on light and color. Lyrical prose reflects Mara's artistic mind, and elision in daydream is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "cracked like exposed film" is purposeful, and sentence variety supports momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of dystopian setting, artistic block, and ancient artifact feels inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet, introspective plot pays off with specific details and authentic vision, transforming familiar tropes.</comment>
