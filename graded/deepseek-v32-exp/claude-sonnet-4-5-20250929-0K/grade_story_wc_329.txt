<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. Her internal conflict between knowing and understanding is embodied in her actions, and the final choice to continue playing despite the violin cracking earns the closure with visible cost. However, interiority could be more nuanced in peak beats, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with cost (violin cracks, statues crumble) under an accumulative/textural lens, reconfiguring the world's state. Causality is strong from inciting incident to climax, with orientation anchored early. The persistent constraint of the mechanical world shapes tactics, and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the sky-bridge and enchanted orchard constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Mira's POV, integrating into action. The environment pressures decisions, such as sneaking past statues, and evolves causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the accumulative lens, with her music intensifying conflict and leading to transformation. Cost is unmistakable through the violin's destruction and statues' weeping. Stakes are clear and tighten meaningfully, though the escalation could be more granular in middle beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges through events and images like the locust shell and blooming orchard, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, and the ending reweights prior material with complexity. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Prose is lyrical and voice-consistent, with elision taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction remains within Mira's lexicon. Dialogue is absent, so not evaluated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Sentences advance story and atmosphere efficiently, and the final line resonates with earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements like the sky-bridge violinist and locust shell form a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific choices, and risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth and authenticity are strong.</comment>
