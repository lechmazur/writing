<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her physical reaction to lies, with embodied emotion (e.g., "tightening in her chest") and micro-choices under pressure. Her final decision to deliver lost words is earned by prior causality, foreclosing her old life with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent causal chain from map discovery to Archive journey, with closure as a decisive change (Mira's commitment to deliver words) that lands with felt cost. The Causal lens holds without ambiguity, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (greenhouse city, toxic sky) and pressures choices through environmental lies and resource scarcity. The Archive as micro-setting constrains the final image, charging Mira's transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes of truth vs. dishonesty escalate through Mira's agency under the Causal lens, from piecing the map to journeying down, with cost legible in her commitment to riskier honesty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of candor emerges through particulars like map annotations and the Archive, with a resonant, non-literal answer in Mira's decision to deliver words, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, and perceptual signature (e.g., "words we swallow don't disappear") remains coherent under pressure. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language (e.g., "skies the color of spoiled milk") serves clarity and momentum in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concept of a Listening Archive for unspoken words is fresh and synthesized with specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in theme heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
