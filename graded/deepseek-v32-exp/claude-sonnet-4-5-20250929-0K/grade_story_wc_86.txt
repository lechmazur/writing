<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Katrin's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as handling the drawer pull. However, contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene, limiting the highest band. The final endurance feels earned but lacks deep internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in Katrin's exhale and solitary figure, under a causal lens that holds throughout. The moon phase method acts as a persistent constraint, shaping tactics. Orientation is clear early, and the exchange proceeds with logical causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The storm-worn parapet and mist actively pressure choices by adding tension and limiting visibility. The drawer pull recurs with charged meaning, constraining Katrin's actions and enriching the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Katrin's agency through the mistrust dialogue and moon phase timing, with cost legible in the risk of failure. The dominant stake of successful exchange tightens meaningfully, though the resolution is slightly predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of recycling mistakes into wisdom emerges organically from the drawer pull and exchange, offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gestures and silences, but the phrase "recycle mistakes into wisdom" leans slightly explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, lyrical voice and rhythmic control. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Sentences advance story and atmosphere cohesively, e.g., "silvering the mist." No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prisoner exchange negotiator using moon phases offers a fresh synthesis, transformed through specific details like the drawer pull. Emotional truth resonates, but the concept isn't groundbreaking, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
