<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and internal conflict shown through frozen hands and reflections. Her final choice to scatter ashes and reconnect is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in acknowledging her withdrawal. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Maya reconfigures grief through insights, with cost legible in her realization of withdrawal. Orientation is clear early, and structure is single POV with one scene, teaching patterns that pay off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Braided ravine and micro-settings (foam patterns, chrysalis) constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details filtered through Maya's POV. Specificity is purposeful, avoiding generic description, and environment shapes tactics in scattering ashes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict between grief and reconnection) escalates under Accumulative lens through density increases from insights. Protagonist agency drives tightening, with cost visible in her decision to foreclose withdrawal path. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of connection/separation emerges organically from particulars (foam patterns, chrysalis, scattering ashes), with subtext in implication. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the final image of flowing grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with perceptual signature rooted in Maya's scientific and musical lexicon. Purposeful compression in reflections is taught and paid off, and rhythmic control under pressure supports clarity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language (e.g., foam patterns) is coherent and serves closure, and syntax accelerates with insights without obscuring cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief narrative with polymer chemistry and musical motifs feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific character choices. Risk-taking in thematic depth heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure is legible with cost.</comment>
