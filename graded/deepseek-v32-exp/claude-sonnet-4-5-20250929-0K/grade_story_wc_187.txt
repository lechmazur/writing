<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elden's motivation to preserve the archive's integrity is clear and drives the narrative, with her preemptive nostalgia trait embodied in actions like pressing palms against crystals. Her final choice to be absorbed is earned through prior causality, though internal contradiction is subtle. The cost of her transformation is legible when the quill falls.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orientation is anchored early; accumulative/textural lens holds with closure as Conceptual Repricing—the archive's self-awareness reconfigures memory and identity. Cost is unmistakable in Elden's absorption and the dropped quill. The solidified fog constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with stormlit observatory and crystals constraining choices via shadow examination. Sensory details like refracted lightning are purposeful. The environment charges the final image of Elden becoming part of the collective memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes around archive integrity escalate through Elden's agency under accumulative lens, from troubled shadows to recursion realization. Cost is legible in her transformation, narrowing options. One meaningful tightening occurs with the central crystal's looped shadow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory and identity emerges through particulars like shadow lengths and crystal whispers, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with Elden's absorption reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control under pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., predecessor's vanishing) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "fog solidified into translucent bridges." Sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative drive, and closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes solid fog, memory crystals, and temporal depth with freshness; concept feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specific details anchor universals.</comment>
