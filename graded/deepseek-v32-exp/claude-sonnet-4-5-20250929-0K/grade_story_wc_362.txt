<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's mystic pursuit and Hartley's shattered assumptions show contradictory impulses in scene; Hartley's final choice to help is earned by his emotional breakdown and the frost evidence, with cost visible in his trembling and grief. Internal conflict is embodied, not summarized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Hartley agrees to help, under a causal lens; cost is legible in the frost patterns representing his wife's memory, and orientation is clear early. The persistent constraint of the frost shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quartz arbor and frost patterns are vivid and purposeful, constraining choice by enabling the revelation through light refraction; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, charging the final image with absorbed memories.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving emotion absorption) escalates through Hartley's frost revelation, driven by Elena's agency with the prism; cost is unmistakable in the emotional weight and foreclosed options, tightening under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of objects witnessing emotions emerges through particulars like the frost patterns and car memories, with subtext in "truthful lies"; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with Elena's perceptual signature; voice is distinct and poetic, dialogue natural and goal-driven, with no head-hopping; elision (e.g., prism use) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful, and sentences advance story without muddle in peak beats like the frost revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise of objects absorbing emotions is fresh and synthesized with specific details like the frost patterns; risk-taking in blending science and mysticism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
