<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aria's motivation is clear and rooted in loss; her interiority is concrete with embodied emotion under pressure, and her final choice to open the door is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the boundary crystallization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the brother's return, cost legible in the fog settling peacefully; causal-accumulative lens holds from start to end, with the persistent constraint of boundaries shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the fog erasing boundaries and the frost used in mirror-making; it charges the final image where boundaries are illuminated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Aria's agency in synchronized breathing and mirror-making, narrowing options to the climax; cost is unmistakable in the cold fire and translucent return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of boundaries emerges through events and images without direct statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the illuminated lines between worlds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a poetic, perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure, such as in the breathing sequences, enhances clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of mirror-making and boundary erosion; risk-taking in style and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
