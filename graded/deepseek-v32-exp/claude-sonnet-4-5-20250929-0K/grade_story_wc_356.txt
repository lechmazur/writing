<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's ambition and internal conflict are concretely embodied through her olfactory sensitivity and journaling; her final realization is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in her endurance of the stench. The shift from ambition to acceptance feels inevitable and character-driven.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a conceptual repricing—Mira's understanding that ambition and acceptance bloom together—felt in the shared journals and framed doodles. The accumulative lens holds, with cost legible in the line about enduring what cannot control. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The treetop village and workshop constrain choices, such as the suspended pot that sways with the trees, charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, dominated by smell, reflecting Mira's POV and professional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the accumulative lens, as the flower's growing scent tests her resolve and leads to her realization. Cost is unmistakable in her endured discomfort and changed perspective, tightening the stake of serenity within motion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the corpse flower's transformation from stench to serenity, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through Mira's shared wisdom. No moralizing; subtext operates in the flower's symbolic weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—Mira's herbalist focus filters sensory detail. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., the weeks passing) is taught and pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("wildflower hush") is purposeful and clear, and sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes unique elements—corpse flower in a treetop village—with specificity that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in focusing on olfactory experience heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
