<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Adelaine's mechanical arm and academic rigor are consistently embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., adjusting the compass while stalling the duel). Harwick's anger and shifted motivation feel earned, though his rapid conversion from duelist to collaborator is slightly tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal drive holds strong: Adelaine's decoding directly averts the duel, culminating in a decisive change to collaboration. Closure lands with cost—foregoing violence for intellectual partnership—anchored in the final image of the atrium as a "cathedral of questions."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The glass atrium and sundial constrain choice and charge the closure; sensory details like "fractured beams" and the brook's murmur are selective and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography remains clear during the collaborative chaos.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from physical duel to intellectual decoding under the causal lens, driven by Adelaine's agency. The cost is legible in the transformed relationship and foregone violence, though the tension softens slightly mid-scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of "questions into destinations" emerges through particulars like the sundial's musical angles, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the decoded overture and reconfigured conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with Adelaine's perceptual signature; dialogue is natural and goal-driven ("You're stalling"). Prose rhythm modulates with pressure, and elision (e.g., Bellini's backstory) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propelled, with varied syntax and minimal artifacts. Minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "cathedral of questions without answers") slightly dulls closure, but line-level craft is strong overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of philosophical duel, mechanical arm, and hidden music feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in blending genres heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors the premise.</comment>
