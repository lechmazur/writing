<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Martin's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion in his scarred hands and trained eyes. His epiphany is earned through the pond scene, showing contradictory impulses between hollow work and seeking meaning. The final choice to return with new seeing is motivated by prior causality, with cost in his shifted perspective. Quick test satisfied: contradictory impulses act in scene, and renunciation is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in Martin's realization that his work is about "creating passages for sight." The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through imagery and reflection to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear by ~120 words with harbor, mist, and atrium. Cost is legible in the final image of him turning toward town with "everything shifted."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the prism atrium and pond constraining choice—the stone throw and ripple patterns directly lead to Martin's epiphany. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, like "mist still clung to the water like breath on glass." Environment charges the final image as a "temple to clear complexity." Quick test met.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal—finding meaning in work—escalating through the pond ripples and Martin's agency in throwing stones. Under accumulative lens, density increases with interference patterns, leading to a deepening that changes knowledge. Cost is visible in his realization that work "remained the same; the seeing was different." Quick test: escalation driven by agency, cost unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, not statement, with the core idea of finding value in attention woven into the ripple patterns and light. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Martin's realization, avoiding moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like pocketing stones and turning toward town. Quick test satisfied.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Martin's professional eye for fractures and light. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, using controlled syntax and rhythm. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure. Quick test: distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, e.g., "mist still clung to the water like breath on glass," and clarity is maintained in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative build. Quick test: zero loops, clear propulsion, no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of mundane craftsmanship with profound epiphany, using specific details like the prism atrium and ripple patterns. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in quiet, lyric resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry. Quick test: specific, non-obvious synthesis with risk that enhances clarity.</comment>
