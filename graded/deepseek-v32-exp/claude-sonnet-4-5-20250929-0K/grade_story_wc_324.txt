<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her backstory anchors her present actions, and the final choice to help Lily is earned by prior causality with visible cost (Lily's bruise and emotional state). However, minor lack of contradictory impulses in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost (Lily's isolation and the need for protection), under a causal drive lens that holds throughout. The plot escalates through because/therefore linkages from the pulse signal to Mira's intervention, with orientation anchored early. The hearing aid as a persistent constraint shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and atmospheric, with sensory details like "bruised hour" and "spiderweb shadows" filtered through Mira's POV. The atrium and hearing aid contribute to tone, but the environment does not directly constrain choices or charge the final image beyond mood, capping the score below 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (Lily's safety) escalate under the causal lens through Mira's agency, from investigation to confrontation, with cost legible in Lily's bruise and emotional breakdown. The tightening forecloses options and forces a trade-off, but the escalation relies slightly on Lily's arrival, which, while earned, limits peak agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of love beyond death emerges organically through events and images (e.g., the hearing aid's pulses, the photograph), with subtext in emotional resonance. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the final image of "hearts never stopped trying to save each other."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure; voice is poetic yet coherent, with dialogue (e.g., Lily's whispers) natural and goal-driven. Purposeful elision in the hearing aid's messages is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and purposeful figurative language (e.g., "twilight poured through the glass ceiling like spilled ink"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats; rhythm accelerates with scene needs, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concept of a "contact tracer for hearts" is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like emotional resonance detection. Risk-taking in blending supernatural elements with emotional stakes heightens coherence without gimmickry, and the closure reconfigures meaning.</comment>
