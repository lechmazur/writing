<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as a resolute scavenger is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions like "Regret tasted like cloud-mist." Internal conflict is shown through her collection of fragments and interaction with the ghost, earning the final acceptance. The closure choice is credible and forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as Mira accepts her ghost, reconfiguring meaning with cost legible when "The camera wheel fell from Mira's fingers." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds with fragments building pressure, and orientation is clear early without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details like "water spiral upward in defiance of gravity" mirroring internal states. The camera wheel as a recurring object evolves in use, enhancing atmosphere and specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Accumulative lens, with fragments and the ghost's approach tightening stakes. The cost is visible in her decision to take the ghost's hand, foreclosing her previous path and altering options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of acceptance emerges from events and images like the ghost and fragments, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "Acceptance was," reweighting prior material through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic rhythm and perceptual signature like "Fragments. Pieces. Words floating on the wind." Elision is taught and paid off, and dialogue, though minimal, carries subtext naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and supports pressure, as in "fractured stillness," without muddling peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines through a non-obvious synthesis of memory, identity, and surreal elements like the kinetic lagoon. Risk-taking in structure and imagery feels organic, with transformation of tropes through specific details and closure.</comment>
