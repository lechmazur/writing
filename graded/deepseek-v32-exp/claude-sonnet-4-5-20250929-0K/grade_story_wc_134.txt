<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her transformation from oracle to student is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in losing her foresight but gaining wonder. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as doubt versus confidence during the pilgrim's arrival.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost: Mara's inability to see futures reconfigures her role. The causal lens holds tightly, with events linked because of her actions. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of her gift's cost shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The musical crystal cave constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "frequencies Mara could taste" filtered through her POV. Shadows and the cave pearl evolve to pressure tactics, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens, from the pilgrim's discordant arrival to the pearl's explosion. The cost is legible in her lost foresight, and the stake—her role versus mystery—tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from events, with subtext in images like "bright darkness." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the cost of knowledge, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, such as noticing "copper and starlight." Voice is poetic yet controlled under pressure, and dialogue advances plot naturally. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, as in "shadows grew teeth," and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of the oracle trope, transformed through specific details like the cave's music. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
