<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Nelle's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority ("flutter in her chest") and micro-choices that reveal values. The final confrontation is earned by prior causality, and her steadfastness balances competence with genuine struggle. No diagnostic label-speak or stock emotions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as the truce reconfigures stakes ("broken trust was a death sentence"), under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and the plot's because/therefore linkage tightens options. The persistent constraint of trust as currency shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful ("lantern-light filtering through the pier's gaps"), with sensory detail integrated into action. The market pressures choices, and the watch fob constrains tactics, charging the final image. No generic or static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Nelle's agency, using the recorder to force a truce, with cost legible in the threat of exposure. Stakes are signaled early and tighten meaningfully under the causal lens. No coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of trust and betrayal emerges through particulars like the "truce of hush" and the recorder, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the reconfigured silence. Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with rhythmic control ("carrying her father's silence like armor"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Rhythm supports pressure, and closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of historical setting with technology feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific character choices. Risk-taking in the confrontation heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
