<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's guilt and motivation are deeply embodied, with micro-choices under pressure, such as ignoring the baby's cries, leading to an earned final choice to rewrite her constellation. The internal conflict is concrete, and the resolution forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost as Vera rewrites her past and the wasp completes its flight, under a causal lens that holds throughout. The plot is tightly linked from inciting incident to resolution, with clear orientation early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds and the amber constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like "moth wings and rust" being selective and purposeful, integrated into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Vera's agency under the causal lens, as she engages with the machine to resolve her guilt, with cost legible when the crying resolves into harmony and the amber clears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of listening and redemption emerges through events and images like the amber and wasp, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, supported by subtext and character arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, poetic yet controlled voice, and no head-hopping; elision like time folding is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity and propulsion, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of concepts like constellation tattooist and lost sounds feels organic and inevitable, with risk-taking in structure that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional specificity.</comment>
