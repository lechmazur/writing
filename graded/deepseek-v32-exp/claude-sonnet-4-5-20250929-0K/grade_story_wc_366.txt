<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's reticence and internal conflict are embodied through micro-choices like clutching the sea glass and writing with shaking hands; her final decision to join the letter chain is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in exposing her loneliness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with Vera's letter addition reweighting isolation and connection; cost is legible in her "hands shaking," and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices—e.g., the haunted lantern room constrains Vera's discovery of the letters—and the sea glass charges the final image as a talisman for transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes of emotional connection escalate under the Accumulative lens through Vera's agency, from observing to protecting and writing; cost is felt in her foreclosed reticence, though escalation is more deepening than causal tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of loneliness and transformation emerges through particulars like the sea glass and stone messages, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature (e.g., "luminescent ache") and rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high density and propulsion without loops or scaffold; figurative language (e.g., "frozen chrysanthemum") is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of the letter chain concept feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the quiet, emotional resolution; specific details like the stone messages avoid template plots.</comment>
