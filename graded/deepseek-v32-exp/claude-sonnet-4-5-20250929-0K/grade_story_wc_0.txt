<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Helena's characterization is deeply embodied, with consistent traits like preprocessing reality shown through specific actions (spreadsheets, cataloging). Her internal conflict between analysis and presence drives micro-choices under pressure, and her final endurance to rebuild is earned with visible cost in the closure image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure is a conceptual repricing where Helena's realization about transformation reweights prior material with felt cost ("the scales glowed like stars"). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality remains intact through patterned reflections.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details (shattered glass, waterlogged plants) filtered through Helena's POV. Micro-setting (workbench, scales) alters tactics and supports the thematic arc without ornamental description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, escalation occurs through density increase in Helena's study of scales, narrowing options from mourning to understanding. Agency in documenting scales drives stakes, with cost legible in her "kindled humility" and decision to rebuild.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of transformation and decay emerges organically from particulars (butterfly scales, neutron stars), with subtext in imagery rather than statement. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through earned insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature blending scientific lexicon and emotional depth. Voice modulates under pressure ("her hands moved with the same precision"), and purposeful compression (e.g., reflection interleaved with action) teaches pattern paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("scales glowed like stars") is coherent and peak-beat clarity is maintained, with syntax accelerating in step with reflective moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of scientific and personal themes feels inevitable, with risk-taking in blending neutron star decay with butterfly transformation. Specific details (androconial scales, pulsar timing) create freshness, and the closure reconfigures meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
