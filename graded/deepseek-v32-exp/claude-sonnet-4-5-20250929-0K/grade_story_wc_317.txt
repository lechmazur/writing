<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Margot's characterization is strong with clear motivation rooted in her trait of receptivity to patterns; her internal conflict between curiosity and protection is shown in her decision to discard the seed, and the final choice is earned by prior causality with visible cost when she forecloses the mystery path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is achieved through a decisive change as Margot drops the seed, with cost legible in the peace that follows; the causal drive lens holds consistently from inciting incident to resolution, and the seed's nature as a trap shapes her tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like the brook's murmur and storm-born silence, and it actively constrains choice by providing the means for discarding the seed, charging the final image with thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Margot's agency under the causal lens, from receiving the seed to realizing its sabotaging nature and taking action; the cost of renouncing the mystery is felt in her protected peace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as the seed's disposal representing resistance to distraction; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent with Margot's perceptive POV, using lyrical phrases like "across the hush of a possibility just born"; no head-hopping or register drift, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; sentences advance story and atmosphere, as in the closure image where the seed tumbles away, maintaining clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise of mystery seed mail as creative sabotage is fresh and well-integrated, transforming tropes through specific details like the corpse flower; originality shines in the synthesis, though it lacks extreme risk-taking.</comment>
