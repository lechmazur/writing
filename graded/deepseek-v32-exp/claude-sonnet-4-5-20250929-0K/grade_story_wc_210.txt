The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the sealed bottle's enduring presence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with the town reviving through memory and imagination, cost legible in the sealed bottle's eternal dance. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the bottle's warmth pulsing like a heart catalyzing the vision.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical prose and rhythmic control under pressure.
