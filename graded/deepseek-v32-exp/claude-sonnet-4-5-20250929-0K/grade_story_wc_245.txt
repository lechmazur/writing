<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sera's characterization is deeply embodied and consistent, with her blindness and sensory perception driving her actions. Her motivation to navigate grief is clear and intensifies, culminating in an earned realization that grief is home. The final choice—accepting grief as territory—is rooted in prior causality, with visible cost in her kneeling and mapping decision. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; interiority is concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, with coherence in Sera's journey to the stillpoint via dowsing rods and the melody. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where she reconfigures grief as inhabitable territory, with cost legible in "the quiet blaze of love that survives." Orientation is anchored early; the drive lens holds without ambiguity, and the stillpoint concept pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest is vividly rendered through non-visual senses, constraining choices and charging the final image. Micro-settings like the dowsing rods and ring evolve with action, shaping tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Sera's POV, with no generic placeholder elements. The environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are internal—navigating grief—signaled early and escalated through accumulative density of sensory details and the trail of notes. Protagonist agency drives escalation under the Accumulative lens, with cost legible in the realization that grief is familiar territory. No coincidence; pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully to the closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of grief as territory emerges organically through events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image of mapping loss, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in the familial melody and forest dialects, inviting reflection without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in Sera's sensory language. Voice is poetic yet controlled, modulating with emotional intensity without head-hopping. Prose rhythm supports pressure, and any elision (e.g., mentor's disappearance) is taught and paid off. No dialogue, so not evaluated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density, advancing story and atmosphere. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, with no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Rhythm and syntax accelerate with scene needs, and closure image is clear. Minor risk of overwriting in peak beats, but controlled and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of blind mapmaker, ultrasonic perception, and stillpoint concept, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. Bold risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
