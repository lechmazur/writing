<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's internal conflict is concretely embodied and drives her decisive choice; her motivation intensifies under pressure, with micro-choices like hovering over the panel revealing a hierarchy of values. The final action to wake Dr. Chen is earned by prior causality (the letter and archived knowledge) with visible cost ("ending her own life as she'd known it").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change under a Causal lens, with Maren's choice to wake Dr. Chen reconfiguring stakes and incurring cost ("she was ending her own life"). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity, reinforced by the letter's trigger and dormant networks' activation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cryogenic archive setting constrains choice through the vault controls and frost-webbed visor, charging the final image of thermal stress and liberated ash. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Maren's professional POV, with the "dizzying quiet" mirroring internal tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maren's agency under the Causal lens, from receiving the letter to overriding safeties, narrowing options and raising the cost of truth versus survival. The dominant stake is signaled early and tightens meaningfully, with the choice foreclosing her former life.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the letter and vaults, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to "What do we owe the truth?" without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures (incinerating the letter) and the final image of "liberated ash," inviting reflection on cost and memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, using compressed diction under stress ("The decision crystallized within the blink") and rhythmic control. Elision (e.g., the letter's contents) is taught and paid off in the climax, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("frost webbing her visor") serves atmosphere without muddle, and the closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes cryogenic preservation and suppressed truths with specificity, transforming tropes through grounded choices like the dormant networks. Risk-taking in the quiet, decisive climax heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
