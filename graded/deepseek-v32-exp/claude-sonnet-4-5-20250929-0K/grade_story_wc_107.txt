<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing contradictory impulses; his final decision to reach out is earned by prior causality with visible cost in abandoning old pain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost when Marcus decides to bring the sphere to his sister; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, reinforced by the river imagery reconfiguring meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image; the control room's panels and river ice mirror internal states, while the glassblowing tools and bookmark actively shape tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marcus's agency under the Accumulative lens, with cost legible in his release of the bookmark; the stake in reconciling with his sister tightens through the thaw motif and his narration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the thawing ice and glassblowing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on release and transformation without moralizing; subtext operates in imagery and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a perceptual signature filtered through Marcus's profession; voice modulates with emotional pressure, and elision (e.g., the argument backstory) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or artifacts; sentences advance story and atmosphere, e.g., "ice fragments glittering downstream like messages," with clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes glassblowing and emotional thawing in a non-obvious way; specific details feel inevitable, and risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
