<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira's claustrophobia and silence-collecting are concretely embodied, with internal conflict between bunker legacy and sky freedom driving micro-choices. Her final decision to stay in the trellis is earned by prior causality, foreclosing the bunker path with visible cost—shattered silence-vessels and rejected maternal teachings. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are specific under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in Mira's choice to "sprout upward," reconfiguring options with cost legible in her rejection of bunkers. Orientation is clear within 120 words; gravity inversion tightens coherence. Closure unit lands on-page with felt cost of abandoning mother's legacy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Xenial trellis and gravity inversion constrain choices (e.g., vine-swinging during inversion) and charge the final image of "sprout upward." Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, such as clouds pressing against lattices. Micro-setting (silence-vessels) recurs to shape tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of internal freedom vs. claustrophobia escalates under Accumulative lens through density increase—inversion, lost silences, doll rescue. Agency drives escalation: Mira's kick and swing narrow options. Cost is legible in shattered "silence of disappointed sighs" and her renunciation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of self-hospitality emerges through particulars like gilded hush and inverted gravity, offering a non-literal answer at closure. Subtext operates in silence-vessels as curated expansion vs. bunker contraction. No moralizing; resonance arises from Mira's embodied realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, biased diction (e.g., "intangibly tangible space"). Rhythm modulates with pressure, like inversion lurch. No head-hopping; elision (silence types) is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density without loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful (e.g., "silence-vessels like strange fruit"). Syntax varies naturally, accelerating during inversion. No register drift or artifact obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravity inversion and silence collection transforms tropes through specific lived detail (claustrophobia, gilded hush). Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
