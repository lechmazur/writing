<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The summoner's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her values. Her solitary nature and endurance (Earned Stasis) are earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her continued loneliness. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, the plot coheres with because/therefore linkages from prophecy to resolution. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: the prophecy is hushed, but the summoner's solitude and constant work persist. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory details (e.g., "candlelight that burned with unnatural stillness") that reflect the POV's priorities. The brook and origami wing function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image, integrating into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the summoner's agency under the Causal lens, as she actively decodes the prophecy and implements her plan. The dominant stake (preventing chaos) tightens through her choices, with cost legible in her solitary victory. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as silence versus chaos, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the wing dissolving into "pure silence," reweighting prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; the poetic voice reflects the summoner's mindset and modulates with pressure. Purposeful compression (e.g., "whispered the spaces between words") is taught and pays off at closure, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is coherent and purpose-driven, enhancing clarity without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of origami, prophecy, and silence feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the lyrical style that heightens stakes. Specific details (e.g., "pressed starflowers") anchor universals, and the concept is fully committed to without retreat.</comment>
