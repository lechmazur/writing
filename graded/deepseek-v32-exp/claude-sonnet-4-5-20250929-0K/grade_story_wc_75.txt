<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Celeste's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as a preserver of culture, with interiority shown through embodied actions like baking bread and using the lens. Micro-choices under pressure reveal her values, and her endurance feels earned. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies detract from her characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the community thawing the ice, reconfiguring options and hope. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with cost legible in "dwindling supplies" and fading traditions. Causality is tight from the beekeeper's death to Celeste's actions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The grotto city and frozen waterfall pressure choices through dampness and ice, constraining tactics. Sensory details like mist and ice are vivid and purposeful. Recurring objects (lens, bread) charge the final image by transforming perception and symbolizing identity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes of survival and preservation escalate through the freeze and dwindling resources, driven by Celeste's agency with the lens and bread. Cost is unmistakable in deaths and limited flour, forcing a trade-off under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of displacement and continuity emerges through particulars like the displaced persons exhibit and bread-making, not statement. Subtext operates in the lens transforming ice to hope. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, lyrical voice reflective of Celeste's cultured perspective. Perceptual signature is clear in her selective attention to artifacts and ice. No head-hopping or register drift; dialogue is natural but minimal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variation, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "rosewater dread" is controlled and purposeful, enhancing momentum without obscuring clarity. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of frozen waterfall, museum, and displaced persons feels inevitable, with specific details like the opera glass lens and bread-making. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure reweights prior material.</comment>
