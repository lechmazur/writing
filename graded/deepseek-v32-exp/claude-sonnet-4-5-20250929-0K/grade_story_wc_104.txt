<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in resilience and strategy. Interiority is concrete, e.g., "worked with the calm of someone who understood," and her final choice to plant seeds is earned by prior causality. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; emotions are embodied under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing as Mira plants seeds, reweighting the premise with cost legible in "each seed a promise." Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages (decoding keys leads to arrow, escape, planting). Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraints (chains, keys) shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "dust motes danced" filtering through Mira's POV. The abandoned carnival constrains choices (piano bench, prize wheel) and charges the final image. Micro-setting elements (keys, arrow) directly alter tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberation and resilience) escalates under causal lens through Mira's agency (decoding, escaping). Cost is legible in her actions and the planting, narrowing options. External pressure (wall demolition) complicates but does not resolve; one meaningful tightening occurs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of resilience and sustainability emerges from events and images, not statement. Final image of planting seeds offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like "the slow, certain return of abundance," reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "the staggering grace of seeds splitting concrete." Voice is consistent and purposefully lyrical, modulating with pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., mentor's backstory) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "roots finding purchase" is controlled and purposeful. No artifacts obscure causality or closure; sentence-level propulsion is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of dystopian elements with seed vault and carnival setting feels organic and inevitable. Specific details (arrow fletching from banned texts) transform tropes. Risk-taking in lyrical tone heightens stakes without gimmickry, supporting closure.</comment>
