<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and consistent, with interiority shown through embodied states like "drowsy alertness." His religious skepticism creates a compelling contradiction, enabling his method of appraising psychic calls. Micro-choices under pressure, such as turning valve wheels, reveal his values and drive the narrative. The final renunciation—understanding the ghost shift as psychic impressions—is earned by prior causality, though his agency feels slightly passive in middle beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost: shadows lighten, and confessions release decades of pressure, reweighting the premise. The accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with pattern buildup from radio calls and valve wheels leading to Marcus's realization. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the final image. The persistent constraint of valve wheels shapes tactics and the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory specificity—ceramic beads, dripping darkness, water hammering—filtered through Marcus's POV. The valve wheels function as micro-setting, constraining choices and charging the final image by altering the ghost shift. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details are integrated into action, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the truth about Tommy Reeves—escalates through Marcus's agency in turning valves and interpreting radio calls. Under the accumulative lens, density increases with confessions, narrowing options. Cost is unmistakable when shadows lift, showing release from swallowed truths. One meaningful tightening occurs, though the escalation relies heavily on external revelations.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of swallowed truth and guilt emerges organically from radio confessions and ghost shift imagery, without direct statement. Subtext operates in gestures like valve wheels as prayers and the hush after confessions. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the conceptual repricing of confession's power, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—Marcus's skeptical, analytical voice filters details like "beads clicked" and "drowsy alertness." Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and dialogue from radio calls feels natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; elision in pattern recognition is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is purposeful, such as "weight of a swallowed truth," and peaks avoid muddle. Read-aloud flow is smooth, and closure image is sharp, with no artifacts harming clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of ghost shift, radio psychics, and valve wheels feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific details like beaded wheels as prayers. Risk-taking with accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, though the concept leans on familiar horror elements.</comment>
