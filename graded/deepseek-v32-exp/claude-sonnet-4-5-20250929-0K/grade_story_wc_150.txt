<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Miriam's motivation is clear and rooted in her diaspora experience, with interiority shown through concrete actions like wandering the orchard. Her final decision to stay is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the transformation of her faith. Minor weakness: some emotional states are summarized rather than fully embodied in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Miriam's decision to stay reweights past and present. Cost is legible in the final image of the sundial casting a shadow. Orientation is clear early, and structure coheres with meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the catacomb orchard constraining choices (e.g., roots breaking through ceilings) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Miriam's POV, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring faith escalates through Miriam's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in her weeks of labor and foreclosed options. Pressure tightens via discoveries in the catacomb, leading to a decisive choice with felt trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of restoration and interconnectedness emerges organically from particulars like the sundial inscription and root imagery, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of intertwined past and present, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical prose and rhythmic control. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., grandmother's letters) is taught and pays off at closure. Voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats like the sundial's placement. Rhythm supports momentum, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of diaspora return, catacomb orchard, and sundial mythology feels inevitable, with risk-taking in accumulative structure heightening stakes. Specific details avoid cliché, and emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
