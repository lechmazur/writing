<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Chen's observant nature is embodied through concrete micro-choices, such as noting Mira's twisted jacket hem, and his tangential approach creates credible internal conflict. Mira's anger and softening are shown through embodied gestures, and their final reconciliation is earned by prior causality with visible cost in Chen's admission of failure. The relationship serves as a crucible, forcing a stance shift that forecloses the path of direct confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as they lean together, with cost legible in Chen's admission and Mira's request for stories. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through emotional density rather than causal turns. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the jade cicada's revelation tightens options naturally. Persistent constraint of observation shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The grotto and tidal pools constrain choice and charge the final image, mirroring transitions through sensory details like "salt-thick air" and mineral deposits. Setting is woven into action, as Chen uses the pools to illustrate his theme. Micro-setting (tidal pools) alters tactics by providing a metaphor that resolves the conflict. Specificity is purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens, as Chen's tangential approach deepens the stakes from personal hurt to thematic understanding. Cost is unmistakable in Chen's admission and their physical leaning, foreclosing direct confrontation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the cicada's backstory reweights options. Dominant stake (relationship) is signaled early and paid off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transition emerges organically through the cicada and tidal pools, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like Mira's hovering hand and shifted breathing. The final image of Chen speaking reweights prior material with emotional honesty. No thematic echo or summary; complexity is embraced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV (Chen) is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, evident in observations like "the water level in the western pool had risen a centimeter." Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit, as Mira's accusations conceal deeper needs. Rhythmic control under pressure, with no head-hopping or register drift. Elision (e.g., foresight) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms that accelerate with emotional beats. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; metaphors like "the grotto breathed" are coherent and voice-motivated. Read-aloud test passes with purposeful compression, such as Chen's foresight blending observation and theme.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of tidal pools, jade cicada, and transition theme, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, as the father-daughter dynamic is grounded in lived detail. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative premise or echo.</comment>
