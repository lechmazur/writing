<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation to discover time's texture is clear and rooted in her retrocognitive condition, driving key choices like pressing the halo fragment. Her final acceptance of her recursive existence is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the disintegration of her photographs. Interiority is concrete and embodied, though minor diagnostic language ("retrocognitively trapped") is dramatized through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with Lyra's realization reweighting time's nature and her role, cost legible in the loss of photographs. The drive lens holds consistently, and orientation is clear early. The halo fragment's persistent constraint shapes tactics, and the ending image charges prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The living bridge garden constrains choices and charges the final image as it reorganizes based on Lyra's actions, with sensory details filtered through her POV. Specificity is high, and the setting evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lyra's agency under the Accumulative lens, as her interaction with the halo fragment tightens stakes and leads to disintegration, with cost unmistakable in the loss of photographs. The dominant stake (discovering time's texture) is signaled early and deepens through geometric revelations.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as fading photographs and hyperbolic geometry, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer (time as soil) that reweights prior material. Subtext operates through implication, avoiding moralizing or abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in Lyra's lyrical, introspective voice. Prose rhythm and diction reflect her state under pressure, and any elision (e.g., time unreliability) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative design, and clarity is maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes retrocognition, hyperbolic geometry, and mystical elements in a fresh, non-obvious way that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in abstract concepts heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the integration is organic, not derivative.</comment>
