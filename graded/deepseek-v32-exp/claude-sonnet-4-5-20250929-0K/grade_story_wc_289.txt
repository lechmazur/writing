<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Margot's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure, such as her throat tightening at the realization of shared humanity. Her final act of adding her own letter is earned by prior causality, foreclosing her isolation with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, e.g., her hollow feelings versus the transformative insight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a conceptual repricing with cost legible in Margot's act of tying her letter, reconfiguring her role under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity. The thrush's nest as a persistent constraint shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lotus temple setting constrains choice and charges the final image, with sensory details like "steam rise from the heated stone petals" filtered through Margot's POV. The environment evolves causally with the rain and prismatic light, supporting the thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Margot's agency under the accumulative lens, as the installation's density deepens her stake in connection, leading to her decisive action with cost on the page. The tightening forecloses her passive role as a mere conduit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of interconnectedness emerges through particulars like the thrush's nest and secrets spiral, offering a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, e.g., Sena's smile and the letter's addition, inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Margot, with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic yet controlled prose. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, e.g., Sena's explanation advances plot without head-hopping. Elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language like "cupped palm holding silence" is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Sentence propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in the non-obvious synthesis of ghostwriting and public art, transforming tropes through specific lived detail. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
