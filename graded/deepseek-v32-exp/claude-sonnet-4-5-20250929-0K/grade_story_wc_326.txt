<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in guilt, with embodied emotion (e.g., breath misting, heartbeat counting) and micro-choices under pressure (spilling ink). Her internal conflict is shown through contradictory impulses, and the final realization is earned by prior causality, foreclosing her guilt with visible cost in tears and peace. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; characterization is deeply integrated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages: Mira's guilt drives her to the observatory, her ink method recovers data, leading to revelation. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where she reinterprets her role, with cost felt in her peace and the porcelain shard image. Orientation is clear early; no plot amnesia or teleporting props.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: observatory under snow with sensory details (e.g., moonlight, old paper smell) that reflect Mira's POV. The environment constrains choice (snow creates silence, observatory as solace) and charges the final image with the porcelain shard. Micro-setting (ink, shard) alters tactics and deepens theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict over guilt) escalates under causal lens through Mira's agency: her ink pattern method narrows options and leads to revelation. Cost is legible in her tears and newfound peace, foreclosing her self-blame path. No coincidence; escalation is driven by protagonist choices with meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events: wisdom from failure through reinterpretation, with subtext in images (porcelain shard, ink patterns). Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material. Earned epiphany arises from concrete particulars, avoiding abstraction or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., rhythmic "one-two-three" counting). Voice is consistent under pressure, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping. Diction matches Mira's professional and emotional state; prose reflects her mind without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful (e.g., "opal observatory gleamed"), and syntax accelerates with scene needs. Clarity and concision maintain momentum; no artifacts or mixed metaphors in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise offers fresh synthesis: death certificate error combined with data recovery via chaos theory. Tropes are transformed through specific choices (ink patterns, porcelain shard), feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure (lyric closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional specificity avoids templates.</comment>
