<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's interior contradictions are concretely embodied, such as her theoretical rebellion versus her acceptance of her father's actions, and her final choice to visit the hospital is earned through prior causality with visible cost in the persistent melancholy. Her emotions are specific and non-diagnostic, shown through actions like tracing symbols and carrying the hospital bracelet. The resolution forecloses her narrow perspective with a felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the final image of melancholy as "fertile ground," under the accumulative/textural lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of symbols decoding leads to a decisive change in stance without causality breaks. The cost is unmistakable in the ending's emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rainwashed library and candle lantern with mica pane constrain choice by enabling the symbol decoding, charging the final image through the amber distortion that reveals "WIDEN YOUR VIEW." Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Maya's POV, with the micro-setting actively shaping tactics. Meets the 9+ test by altering options.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maya's agency under the accumulative lens, as her discovery of the symbols as questions deepens the internal conflict, leading to a tightening of stakes with cost in her transformed melancholy. The dominant stake of reconciling love and resentment is signaled early and reweighted through her realization, though the escalation is more gradual than sharp.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the symbols and koans, offering a non-literal answer to questions of forgiveness and perspective without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material through the image of sunlight as "possibility," and subtext operates in gestures and silence. Avoids thematic echo or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice has a distinct perceptual signature reflective of Maya's academic background, with controlled rhythmic variation and no head-hopping. POV is stable and filters detail through her bias, such as noticing patterns and probabilities. Elision in symbol decoding is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax without loops or scaffold issues; figurative language like "melancholy felt alive, growing like clover" is purposeful and clear. Momentum is maintained through concise advances, and read-aloud rhythm supports emotional beats. No artifacts in peak moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the non-obvious synthesis of probability theory with personal grief, transforming familiar themes through specific details like subway symbols and the lantern. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight. Fresh inflection in the "widen your view" insight.</comment>
