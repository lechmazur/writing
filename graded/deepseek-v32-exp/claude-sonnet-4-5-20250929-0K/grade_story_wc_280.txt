<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Margaux's motivation is clear and rooted in her spectral existence, with interiority shown through synesthesia and temporal fragmentation. Her final choice to perform and fade is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in her dissolution. However, some emotional beats rely on abstract description rather than embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens, with Margaux's fading into the garden offering a felt cost. The fractured timeline is taught early and pays off, maintaining coherence. No orientation debt or causality breaks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Margaux's agency under the accumulative lens, as her performance produces echoes that lure an audience across time.

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, exploring memory and art through echoes and performance.

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic voice that reflects Margaux's synesthetic perception. Rhythm and diction control heighten pressure, and elision (e.g., fractured time) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, without loops or scaffolds. Sentences advance story and atmosphere seamlessly, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of ghostly synesthesia, fractured time, and mystical objects.
