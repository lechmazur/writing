<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Celeste's characterization is strong with concrete interiority and embodied emotions; her "diligently curious" nature drives micro-choices under pressure, such as decoding the hopscotch sequence, and her final decision to investigate is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her cautious approach.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal drive with clear linkage from discovery to decoding; closure is a decisive change as Celeste smudges the marks and plans to investigate, with cost legible in her need for patience; orientation is anchored early, and the lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory details; the airship and hopscotch board constrain choices and charge the final image, while starlings' murmurations mirror thematic patterns without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the causal lens through Celeste's agency; her decoding tightens options, and the cost is felt in her strategic patience, foreclosing immediate action with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from patterns and secrecy; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the starlings' wisdom, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct with a poetic, perceptive signature; POV is stable and filters details through Celeste's bias; elision in the hopscotch discovery is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control; no loops or artifacts obscure clarity, and figurative language like "murmurations breaking apart like a secret" enhances peak beats without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of cartography and mystery; the hopscotch encoding feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in the quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
