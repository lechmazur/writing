<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to honor overlooked histories is clear and consistent, driving her choices. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion like "throat tight," and her final action to exhibit the paintings is earned by prior causality. However, internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, with closure as Conceptual Repricing via the exhibition anchoring forgotten names. Orientation is clear early, and the mosaic structure (market, studio, exhibition) is taught and coherent. Cost is legible in the final image of rainbows casting on names.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the alchemist's market and lighthouse lens fragment constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as the lens transforming the market's view, enhancing thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes of preserving overlooked histories escalate through Mira's agency with the lens, under the Accumulative lens. A meaningful tightening occurs as hidden details are revealed, foreclosing options with cost in the exhibition. However, escalation relies more on revelation than active conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory and translation emerges organically through images and actions, with subtext in the lens and paintings. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though it leans slightly toward thematic echo in the vendor's dialogue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, lyrical voice and perceptual signature. Prose rhythm controls pressure, and any elision (e.g., time jumps) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping, but dialogue is minimal and functional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, such as "splitting sunset into impossible colors," and closure clarity is maintained without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes translation, memory, and hidden histories in a non-obvious way, feeling inevitable. Risk-taking in mosaic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors universals, though it echoes familiar literary motifs.</comment>
