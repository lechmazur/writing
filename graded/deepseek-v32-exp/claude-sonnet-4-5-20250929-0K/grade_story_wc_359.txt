<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her synesthetic traits, driving her to prove wonder's necessity. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like "frost-numbed fingers" and sensory perceptions. However, the lack of internal contradiction or flawed decision-making under pressure limits depth, though her final realization feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as the sculpted hush redefines wonder's value, with cost legible in Mira's realization. The hybrid lens (causal and accumulative) holds, with the ice cavern and amber sheet creating coherent pressure. Orientation is clear early, and the ending reweights prior stakes effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ice cavern setting is vividly described with sensory details like "organ-pipe columns" and aurora light, constraining choices as Mira interacts with it. It charges the final image by being integral to the hush's unfettering, though some descriptions border on ornate without harming momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mira's agency, such as using the hammer to strike the ice, narrowing options and leading to measurable proof. Cost is legible in the data recording and her realization, under the hybrid lens. However, the Council's off-page resolution slightly softens the on-page pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events like the hush's liberation, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to wonder's necessity without moralizing. The final image reweights beauty's role in survival, supported by particulars like the bells guiding travelers home.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature from Mira's synesthesia, filtering details through her unique senses. Prose rhythm and diction remain consistent under pressure, with purposeful elision in moments like "the sculpted hush revealed itself." No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and dense with high information density, advancing story through sensory imagery. Minor overwriting occurs in phrases like "geometric voids that nonetheless possessed weight," but no major artifacts, loops, or clarity issues harm closure. Rhythm supports emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story synthesizes synesthesia, ice caverns, and a sculpted hush into a fresh, non-obvious concept that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical abstraction pays off with coherence, and the core premise transforms familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices in character and setting.</comment>
