<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is strong with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure; her internal conflict between certainty and doubt is shown in scene, and her final choice to embrace nuance is earned with visible cost when she clips the mirror shard.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with clear linkage from Vincent's case to Mara's crisis; closure is a decisive change on-page as she decides to offer questions instead of answers, with cost felt in her renunciation of certainty.</comment>
