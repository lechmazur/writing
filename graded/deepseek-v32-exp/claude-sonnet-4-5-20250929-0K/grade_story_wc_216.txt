<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as embedding coded messages. Her endurance as a timekeeper is earned, with visible cost in the risk from Fluid Timers, and contradictory impulses between nostalgia and danger act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orientation is anchored early; closure lands with conceptual repricing in the final image of visitors carrying "fixed time," with cost felt through loss and nostalgia. The accumulative lens holds, and the silo's constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the emerald silo and urn fragment constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are filtered through Mira's POV, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving linear time) escalates through Mira's agency in secret sessions, with cost legible in the trade-off between freedom and certainty. Pressure tightens under the accumulative lens, foreclosing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events, such as the urn fragment and silo light, with subtext in implication. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to time's value without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic yet concrete perceptual signature. Rhythm and diction control heighten pressure, and any elision (e.g., time fluidity) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats like the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of time and memory, transformed through specific details like the garage sale method. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
