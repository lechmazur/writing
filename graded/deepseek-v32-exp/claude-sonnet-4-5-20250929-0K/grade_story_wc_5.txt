<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and rooted in her traits, with physical patience demonstrated through deliberate actions. Her interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing, and her final choice to seal the maps feels earned by prior causality. However, minor lack of internal contradiction in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Vera seals the maps, reconfiguring hope under an accumulative lens. The drive lens holds consistently, with orientation anchored early. The persistent constraint of the orchard's dying state shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices, such as the frost-silvered orchard constraining Vera's patterns. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, charging the final image. The crater environment functions as a micro-setting that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Vera's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in her hours of patient work. The dominant stake of mapping heartbeats tightens through density increase, leading to a meaningful deepening. No coincidental resolution undermines earned causality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the storybook plate and flash-paper, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to persistence and hope. Subtext operates through implication in gestures and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Vera's patience. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, supporting momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The core concept of safekept starlight is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity in details like the copper plate transforms familiar tropes.</comment>
