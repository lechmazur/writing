<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is concrete and evolved; her rational foraging contrasts with her emotional shift when pocketing the eye, and her final choice to host others is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her isolation. Internal conflict is embodied in micro-choices, such as dismissing the impulse yet keeping the relic, revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with clear orientation; the closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the final image of the glass eye as a beacon reweights the premise with felt cost in community reconciliation and Mira's changed stance. The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and the relic's integration tightens options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The hanging orchard setting constrains choices through rope bridges and storms, charging the final image and shaping tactics like foraging and meetings. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's POV, with the environment acting as a micro-setting that alters outcomes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens, from finding the eye to deciding to help others, with cost legible in her foreclosed isolation and the community's careful interactions. The dominant stake of psychological safety tightens through a meaningful turn that narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, exploring rationality versus human ritual through the relic's symbolic role, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer on the grace between truth and lies. Subtext operates in gestures and implications, avoiding moralizing while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—Mira's rational, observant voice—and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present, and any elision is taught and paid off without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level rhythm varies purposefully, and diction remains within Mira's lexicon, avoiding artifacts even in peak beats like the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines through a non-obvious synthesis of the empathy virus and relic folklore, transformed by specific character choices and setting. Risk-taking in the quiet, conceptual closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
