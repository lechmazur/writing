<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Moth's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; her social perceptiveness and artistic drive create credible micro-choices. The final endurance in drawing is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the collective search for meaning. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; interiority is concrete and embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative lens; the final image of the "meaning-wheel" reweights prior material with conceptual cost. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity. The tile flake and grotto acoustics shape tactics consistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful; the grotto's limestone walls and mist constrain choices through acoustics and atmosphere. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, charging the final image. The grotto functions as a micro-setting that alters tactics and supports theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Moth's agency in drawing and the emergent collective attention, deepening under the accumulative lens. The cost of unlearning is legible in the pattern's creation. One meaningful tightening occurs as the hush reweights options, foreclosing paths without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, not statement; the mandala pattern offers a non-literal answer to memory loss. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, resisting moralizing. The ending reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and rhythmic control under pressure. Diction matches Moth's perception; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure. Dialogue is minimal but natural, carrying subtext in the interjection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and enhances clarity; no loops or scaffold obscure causality. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and synthesized through specific details; the unlearning concept and chalk art combine with inevitability. Risk in lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation of tropes through grounded choices makes the story memorable.</comment>
