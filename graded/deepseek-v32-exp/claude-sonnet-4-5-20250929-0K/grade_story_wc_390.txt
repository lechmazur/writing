<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Meris's characterization is strong with concrete interiority and embodied emotion; her final choice to adapt the key is earned by prior causality, blending logical engineering with protective fury, and the cost of her vigil is felt on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Meris adapts the key to her heartbeat, locking her into the guardian role with visible cost; causal lens holds tightly from inciting incident to resolution, and orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the lighthouse's harmonic calibration; sensory details like "cutting wind" and "amber light" are purposeful, and the environment charges the final image of protective vigil.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Meris's agency under the causal lens, as she actively rekeys the frequency to counter the approaching threat; the cost of her lifelong commitment is legible in the climax, tightening the stakes meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of sonic absolution and the cost of erasure, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer about protection and sacrifice without moralizing; subtext operates in images like the key resonating with bone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, blending engineering lexicon with poetic introspection; voice remains consistent under pressure, and perceptual signature is sharp, as in "her engineer's mind racing through the physics."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or artifacts; sentences advance story and atmosphere, such as "The lighthouse hummed a frequency calibrated to match the vibrational signature," and closure is clear and propelled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes lighthouse engineering with sonic absolution in a fresh, non-obvious way; specific details like the key's wavelength patterns and vibrational matching create inevitability, and risk-taking in tone heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
