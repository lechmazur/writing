<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's characterization is concrete and consistent, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing patterns and confronting Galloway. Her adaptability drives key decisions, and the final choice to create from fury is earned by prior causality. The cost is visible in the binding of Galloway and her return to the kiln, fulfilling the quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with clear orientation early; closure is a decisive change (Galloway bound, Vera creating) with felt cost in the confrontation and resilience. The lens holds without ambiguity, and persistent constraints (her adaptability) shape tactics. Cost is legible in the final image of frost melting as the kiln roars.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail, such as the canyon and frost patterns, which constrain choice by leading Vera to the cave. The environment charges the final image as frost melts with the kiln's ignition, meeting the quick test for constraining action and resonating at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the causal lens through Vera's agency, from investigation to confrontation, narrowing options and revealing cost in the risk taken. The dominant stake (survival and truth) tightens meaningfully, and the resolution is earned with visible price in Galloway's capture and her renewed purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges through concrete images like glass and frost, with subtext in dialogue and actions; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer by transforming fury into light without moralizing. Epiphanies are earned through struggle, and the final image reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, poetic yet controlled rhythm, and natural dialogue. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., patterned tracing) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift, fulfilling the quick test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or scaffolds; figurative language is integrated, and propulsion supports scene needs. No artifacts obscure causality or closure, and the final line resonates with clarity, passing the quick test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of glass artistry with a mystery plot, transforming tropes through specific details like frost patterns and adaptive traits. Risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
