<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maris's characterization is deeply rooted in her past and present, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as offering the scroll, revealing her hierarchy of values. The visitor's shift adds depth, and the final endurance is earned with visible cost in the smelting action. Contradictory impulses are shown in her acceptance of routine and mystery, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual repricing via the visitor's realization and the mobile's image, reconfiguring wonder without the future; cost is legible in her smile and Maris's response. The accumulative/textural lens holds, reinforced by lunar cycles shaping tactics. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and no causality breaks occur.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The tidal atrium and lunar mechanisms constrain choices and charge the final image of the migrating mobile, with sensory details like moonlight silvering water. Micro-settings like the creel and forge are integral to action, and specificity avoids cliché, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving wonder escalates through the visitor's entry and scroll choice, driven by Maris's agency under the accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable in the identity transformation and visitor's shift, but escalation is slightly muted by the quiet interaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images like the mobile and creel, with subtext in gestures and silence; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The conceptual repricing reweights prior material, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
