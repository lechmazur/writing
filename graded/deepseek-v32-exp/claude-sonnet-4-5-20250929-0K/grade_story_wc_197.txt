<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is concrete and resourceful, with embodied micro-choices under pressure, such as photographing the puddle-map and hiding in the vault. Her motivation to "hold the line" is consistent and intensifies, compelling her actions. However, the absence of strong contradictory impulses in scene slightly limits depth, though her final endurance is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise, reconfiguring options and stakes as Mira waits in the dark, planning her next move with felt cost. The hybrid causal-accumulative lens holds strong, driven by because/therefore linkages from the raid to her tactics. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of evasion shapes the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The auric lagoon and maintenance hatch constrain choices and charge the final image, with vivid sensory details filtered through Mira's urgency. Setting is woven into action, such as the puddle-map revelation and hatch use, altering tactics. Specificity is purposeful and cohesive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake against tyranny escalates under the hybrid lens through Mira's agency, forced by the searchlight to vanish, narrowing options with visible cost. The tightening is driven by her resourcefulness, and the cost of continued resistance is legible in her hiding and planning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resistance through small, persistent acts emerges organically from events and images, like the puddle-maps and obsolete key, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mira's charged poise, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in selective attention to the lagoon and coded freedom. Voice is controlled under pressure, with purposeful compression in high-stakes moments. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere efficiently, such as "the truth had a way of persisting in overlooked places." Read-aloud ear test passes smoothly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of revised histories and resourceful resistance feels inevitable and fresh, with risk-taking in the quiet, persistent climax. Specific details like the phone booth key and auric lagoon transform tropes through grounded choices, heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
