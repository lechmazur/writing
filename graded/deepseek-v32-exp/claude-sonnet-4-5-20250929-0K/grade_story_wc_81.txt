<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her profession and desire for truth. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as "her pulse quickened with dappled resolve." Micro-choices under pressure, like navigating the stacks, reveal her values. The final renewal of purpose is earned, though contradictory impulses are mild.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Mira's realization reconfigures her purpose, under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the blackout constraint shapes tactics. The stamp discovery leads logically to cross-referencing, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and pressurized, with the sunken library and blackout forcing handwritten work and affecting navigation. Sensory details like "water dripping" are selective. The stamp as a micro-setting object constrains choice and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes of uncovering truth escalate through Mira's agency, from stamp discovery to journal cross-referencing. Cost is legible in her renewed purpose and the irony of the blackout. Under Accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth preservation emerges through events and images, like the stamp's phrase and blackout irony. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in "darkness enough to see" deepens reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in rhythmic prose like "tranquilly perceptive." No head-hopping; voice modulates with pressure, such as in the climax. Elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language, like "swimming shadows," is purposeful. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, supporting momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes sunken library and alternative history with specificity, feeling inevitable. Tropes are transformed through grounded details like the stamp. Risk-taking in quiet internal plot heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
