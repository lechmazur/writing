<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her sister's disappearance, with embodied emotion in clutching the hair. Her micro-choices under pressure, like unwinding the ribbon, reveal her values. The final transformation into the locksmith is earned by prior causality, though the locksmith remains slightly archetypal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Mara becomes the new locksmith, reconfiguring her role with felt cost. The causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages from her actions to the revelation. Orientation is clear early, and the nexus shift pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "cobblestones gleamed like dark water," and the nexus actively constrains choices by disorienting Mara. The environment charges the final image of the room of doors, integral to the plot's logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unlocking secrets escalates through Mara's agency under the causal lens, with cost legible when she scatters the hair and takes on the new role.

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of secrets and transformation emerges through particulars like the ribbon and city's nature, without moralizing.

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending poetic diction with Mara's urgency.
