<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and rooted in his negative luck score, driving his quest for answers. The vine dresser's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion in her polishing and storytelling. Her final stance—proving the garden knows her—is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the garden's behavior. Contradictory impulses are less prominent, but micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing via the garden's impossible blooming and withering, reweighting luck measurement with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with accumulation of marble details leading to Marcus's realization. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the final image. Persistent constraint of the garden's behavior shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like polished marbles and off-season blooms filtered through POV. The garden maze pressures choices and charges the final image by opening paths for the vine dresser. Micro-setting elements (marbles, garden) constrain choices and integrate with action, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of quantified luck vs. personal truth escalates under the Accumulative lens through density increase in the vine dresser's stories. Agency drives escalation, with her actions forcing Marcus's realization. Cost is legible in the garden's recognition, foreclosing the path of relying on luck scores. One meaningful tightening occurs as understanding dawns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as cracked marbles and the garden's behavior, without direct statement. Subtext operates in implication, e.g., marbles mending deception. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through "some truths can't be quantified, only cultivated," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Marcus, with distinct perceptual signature in lyrical observations like "caught the light like broken teeth." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Voice remains coherent under pressure, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping. Elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; lines like "blooming and withering in impossible simultaneity" serve multiple jobs. Syntax varies purposefully, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines through a non-obvious synthesis of quantified luck and personal cultivation, transformed via specific characters and setting. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, with particulars like marbles commemorating lies. Inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
