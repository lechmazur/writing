<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Potter's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, e.g., "she did know, in the wordless way her hands knew." Final choice to take the lantern glass is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the final image of carrying the lantern glass; Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong with pattern shifts; orientation is clear early, and structure is coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the lantern glass constraining choice and charging the final image; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, e.g., "dust motes hung suspended."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, with cost legible in her realization and decision; stakes tighten through interaction with beekeeper and lantern glass, foreclosing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, not statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the accumulated light of gentle acts, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and rhythmic, e.g., "phototropic across time"; dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "timelines fractured and overlapped like cracks in twice-fired clay."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable; risk-taking in non-linear timelines heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; specific details anchor universals.</comment>
