<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply rooted in consistent traits and embodied emotion, with micro-choices under pressure driving her investigation and revision of the oracle. Her internal conflict between certainty and doubt is dramatized in scene, and her final choice to embrace uncertainty is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Chen provides secondary pressure without flattening her agency. The only minor slip is a slight over-reliance on diagnostic language in peak beats, but it doesn't undermine closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Plot operates under a clear causal lens, with events linked by because/therefore logic from Mira's fever to her rewriting the oracle. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the new advisory "conditions uncertain, recommend caution" reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The persistent constraint of uncertainty shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and purposeful, with the mountain weather station and frost patterns filtering through Mira's POV to pressure choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, such as the console glow and rising dawn. The environment constrains choice by isolating the characters and amplifying the stakes, directly supporting closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Conflict centers on the dominant stake of safety versus certainty, escalating through Mira's agency under the causal lens. Her investigation and rewriting of the oracle constitute a meaningful tightening that forecloses the path of blind trust with felt cost. The escalation is driven by her choices, and the cost is legible in the advisory and the acknowledgment of irreversible loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the botanical illustration and marginalized data, exploring certainty versus wisdom without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the oracle's new advisory, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, avoiding abstraction or tidy resolutions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a lyrical yet precise perceptual signature that reflects Mira's expertise and post-fever clarity. POV is stable and single, with dialogue natural and goal-driven. Elision in the fever dreams is taught and paid off at closure. Minor register consistency in peak beats prevents a higher score, but no head-hopping or voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language, like "auroral sorrow," is coherent and voice-motivated. No artifacts obscure causality or closure; propulsion is maintained through varied syntax and concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality lies in the specific synthesis of AI fault-tolerance and human uncertainty, transformed through grounded character choices and setting. The core premise offers a fresh angle on familiar tech-ethics themes, with risk-taking in structure and theme heightening stakes without gimmickry. The closure feels inevitable in hindsight, supported by vivid particulars.</comment>
