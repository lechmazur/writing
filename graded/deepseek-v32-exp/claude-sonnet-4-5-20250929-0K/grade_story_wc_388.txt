<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot from investigation to a nuanced final choice. Her internal conflict is embodied in the decision to protect the diamond, earning the closure with visible cost. The trait of being a debunker shapes her actions and the stakes, with no stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost as Vera reburies the diamond, reconfigured under the causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and events follow because/therefore linkages. The persistent constraint of the diamond's location shapes tactics, and cost is legible in the final image of leaving lies behind.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the wasteland orchard and radioactive dust pressuring Vera's choices. The diamond as a micro-setting object constrains her actions and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, reflecting POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes of truth vs. hope escalate through Vera's agency under the causal lens, culminating in a choice that forecloses full disclosure with cost. The tightening from investigation to decision narrows options meaningfully, and the cost is unmistakable in her reburial act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth and comfort emerges implicitly from events, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through Vera's decision. Subtext operates in her actions and the final image, avoiding moralizing. The concept integrates seamlessly with character arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature that reflects Vera's analytical nature. Rhythm and diction control under pressure, and any elision (e.g., in reassembly) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops or scaffolds; figurative language is purposeful and clear. Sentence-level craft supports momentum without obscuring causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes post-apocalyptic and scientific elements with originality, transformed through specific character choices. The stillpoint concept feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in the quiet ending heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
