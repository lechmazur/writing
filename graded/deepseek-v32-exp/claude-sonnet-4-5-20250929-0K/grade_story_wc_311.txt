<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses acting in scene, such as her trembling fingers and crystallized memory of Daniel. Her renunciation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her grief. The final choice forecloses a path with felt cost, scaled to the length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Mira's acceptance and naming of fears. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, reinforced by the atlas page's reprise. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The observatory and atlas page function as micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, e.g., "cracked lens" and "fractured rainbows," filtered through Mira's POV to mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Mira's agency, deepening through reflections to a tightening where she forecloses love for duty. Cost is legible in her grief and the echo of sacrifice, with one meaningful reweighting of stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the sea monsters and echoes, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to sacrifice without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and images, e.g., the atlas page reweighting meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Elision (e.g., the predecessor's phrases) is taught and paid off, enhancing the accumulative design without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "crystallized the memory," without muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports the lyrical tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes the reaper trope with cartography and sacrifice in a non-obvious way, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyrical heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and specific details anchor the vision.</comment>
