<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in idealism, with embodied emotion like "spongey dread" and micro-choices under pressure, such as deciding to explore the wound-door. Her internal conflict between nervousness and confidence is shown in scene, and the final choice is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Dr. Kao applies secondary pressure, enhancing the crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise with Mira and Dr. Kao heading to the airlock, reconfiguring options with felt cost under a Causal lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the wound-door as a persistent constraint shapes tactics. The cost is legible in the risk of the unknown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like "violet clouds" and "synthetic coffee," and the weather station environment pressures choices. The copper nail and journals recur, constraining decisions and charging the final image. Specificity is purposeful and integrated with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake in proving reversible exile escalates through Mira's agency, from decoding journals to deciding to act, under the Causal lens. Cost is legible in the risk taken, and one meaningful tightening forecloses options. Dr. Kao's involvement adds secondary pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of exile and permanence emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures like Mira holding the nail. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the wound-door exploration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is literary and controlled, with dialogue that feels natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure. Rhythm supports pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise and vivid with high information density, varied sentence rhythm, and no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "impossible geometries" is purposeful and coherent, and propulsion is maintained through peak beats without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of Arctic exploration, coded journals, and reversible exile, transformed through specific character choices. Risk-taking in the metaphysical concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
