<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and micro-choices like reopening scars to access memories driving the narrative. Internal conflict is shown through contradictory impulses, such as picking at scars despite promises, and the final shift to seeking justice is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with visceral cost as Mara accepts justice over closure, supported by causal linkages from plant communication to Dr. Venn's revelation. The hybrid drive lens (causal dominant) holds, and orientation is clear within the first lines, with the meteor's hush as a persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tower's meteor-induced hush and tactile objects like the coffee rings and hourglass actively shape Mara's investigative options and charge the final image. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, with the table's memories constraining choice at the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara's active tunneling through plant memories and examining coffee rings escalates the conflict under causal agency, with cost legible in her reopened wrist and emotional resolve. Stakes tighten meaningfully from seeking closure to pursuing justice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of reading stories in scars and displaced miracles emerges through concrete images like the hourglass and coffee rings, with the final line "Some wounds opened themselves" offering a resonant, non-literal reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with a distinct, lyrical voice that reflects Mara's pain-heightened perception. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off, such as in the gradual revelation of plant communication.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with varied syntax and rhythm advancing multiple narrative layers without loops or artifacts. Figurative language, like "morphine fog," serves pressure and clarity even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The fusion of plant telepathy, forensic coffee-ring reading, and a frozen hourglass creates a unique synthesis that feels inevitable, with risk-taking in magical realism heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
