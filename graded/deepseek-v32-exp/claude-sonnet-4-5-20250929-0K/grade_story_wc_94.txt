<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied, with contradictions like "angry and still" acting simultaneously in scene. Her motivation to map scars drives consistent micro-choices, such as using the timer, and her final resolve feels earned by prior causality with visible cost in her continued vigil.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with Mara's determination crystallizing; the accumulative lens holds, building through imagery and reflection. Cost is legible in "the cartography of scars required patient mapmaking," and orientation is clear within the first 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory constrains choice and charges the final image, with sensory details like "copper dome catching lightning" filtered through Mara's POV. The setting pressures her actions and mirrors internal states, avoiding cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Mara's agency in writing and disseminating poems, tightening the stake of resistance. Cost is unmistakable in her disciplined vigils and the network's "conspiracy of whispers," foreclosing easier paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the darkroom timer and scars metaphor, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to censorship and resistance. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, such as poems passed hand to hand, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature like "electrical veins split the sky." Rhythm modulates with the storm, and any elision is taught and paid off in closure, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, as in "cartography of scars," and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a censored poet in an observatory feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightening stakes. Specific details like the darkroom timer transform familiar tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
