<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The queen's characterization is deeply embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., steadying her fingers) revealing internal conflict. Her disenchantment and past actions are woven into the present, making the final realization earned. The shift from cold command to vulnerable terror feels inevitable and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the queen carries the bleeding starlight inside, a felt cost that reweights her journey. The accumulative lens holds, with dreams driving causality to a decisive internal change. Orientation is clear early, and the grotto's revelation tightens stakes meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto constrains choice and charges the final image, with sensory details like "walls wept light" filtering through the queen's POV. Setting pressures her confrontation with memory, and the elevated micro-setting above clouds shapes the entire narrative arc with purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the queen's agency under the accumulative lens, as the grotto experience deepens her internal stakes. The cost is unmistakable in her disenchantment and terror, foreclosing her former numbness. A single meaningful tightening—the shared exhale and fireflies—reweights options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images like the bleeding starlight, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to self-discovery without moralizing. The final reconfiguration—carrying the wound as potential healing—reweights prior material with complexity. Subtext operates through gesture and silence, such as the grotto's dialogue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects the queen's mindset. Rhythmic control under pressure avoids head-hopping, and elision (e.g., the oracle's warning) is taught and paid off. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, sustaining coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure.
