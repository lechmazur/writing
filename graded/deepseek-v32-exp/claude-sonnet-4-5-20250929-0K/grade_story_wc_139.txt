<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of honesty versus deception emerges through events and symbols like the ink pot, without direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mara's mathematical analogy and Vincent's tears. Subtext operates in gesture and setting; no moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV from Mara is stable with distinct perceptual signature, using mathematical analogy. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with subtext in the confrontation. No head-hopping; voice modulates under pressure with purposeful compression. Elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.
