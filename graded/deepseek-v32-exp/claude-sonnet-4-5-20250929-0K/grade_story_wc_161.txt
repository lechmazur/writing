<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Clara's characterization is deeply rooted in her reinventions and search for authenticity, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. Her final decision to stay and build an honest paper trail is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in overcoming the instinct to flee. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with closure as Charged Poise when Clara places the meteorite and commits to documentation, reconfiguring her stance on trust. Cost is legible in the final image of balancing "what blooms and what withers." Orientation is clear early, and the single-scene structure coheres.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the attic's dust and skylight shaping Clara's realizations. The meteorite and cylinders charge the final image, with sensory details filtered through POV. Environment actively pressures tactics and supports theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on trust and preservation, escalating through Clara's internal conflict and culminating in her agency to stay rather than flee. Under the accumulative lens, density increases with reflections, and cost is felt in her renunciation of self-imposed reinvention.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of identity and trust emerge through particulars like the meteorite and dust motes, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Clara's decision to document, reweighting prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Clara's professional bias and rhythmic prose. Minimal dialogue is natural, and elision (e.g., past reinventions) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops or scaffold issues; figurative language (e.g., dust motes as galaxy) is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements like pigeon training and meteorite feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the quiet, reflective closure. Specific details avoid tropes, and the premise is transformed through grounded character choices.</comment>
