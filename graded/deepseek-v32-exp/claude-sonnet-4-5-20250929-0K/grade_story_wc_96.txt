<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply integrated with the molting trait, showing contradictory impulses in scene (e.g., smiling feels borrowed); final choice to plant seeds is earned with visible cost in forgetting and shifting selves.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration under accumulative lens; cost is felt in the acceptance of impermanence ("remember, hazily"); orientation is clear early with who, where, when anchored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices (library used for planting) and charging the final image; sensory details (rusted metal, desert sky) are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate meaningfully through protagonist agency (decision to plant seeds everywhere); cost is legible in the effort and acceptance that she will forget the specific joy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (seeds, ruins, molting); ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting beauty and anarchy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic with stable POV; dialogue natural and goal-driven (Kai's laughter and requests); perceptual signature is strong in rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with clear propulsion; no loops or scaffolds; figurative language ("luminous fracture") is consistent and purposeful in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and ingenious; molting personalities and blooming resistance are synthesized with specificity and risk, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
