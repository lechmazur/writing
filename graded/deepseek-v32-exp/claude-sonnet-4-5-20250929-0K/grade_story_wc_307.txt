<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Researcher's backward aging and careful truth-weaving create compelling interiority; micro-choices under pressure, like withholding revelation until readiness, are earned and cost-legible in her forgetting. Student's fear and growth are embodied, with no stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration where student understands vanishing, with cost in researcher's forgetting. Orientation is clear early; persistent constraint of aging shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Floating platform and magnetic grotto are vivid and purposeful, charging the final image; sensory details like "blue-black minerals hummed" are filtered through POV, but environment constrains choice only indirectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of teaching vanishing escalates through student's trance-induced perception shift; agency-driven deepening under accumulative lens, with cost legible in aligned readiness and researcher's loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of vanishing/appearing emerges organically from pond ripples and backward aging; ending offers non-literal resonance without moralizing, reweighting prior material through conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "sycamore hush"); voice is poetic yet controlled, and dialogue advances plot naturally; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; lines like "phantom spaces where the water seemed to vanish" advance story and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Backward aging premise is fresh synthesis with teaching motif; risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without gimmickry; specifics feel inevitable and transformative.</comment>
