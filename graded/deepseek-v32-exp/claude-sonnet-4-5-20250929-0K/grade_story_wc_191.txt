<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kaida's motivation is clear and rooted in her traits as a lore keeper, with interiority shown through embodied emotion (e.g., "pulse quicken"). Her final choice to descend is earned by prior causality, but lacks deep contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (descending into the archive) and felt cost (risk of autocrat discovery). The causal lens holds tightly from discovery to ascent, with orientation anchored early and no breaks in causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the orchard and throne room constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are POV-filtered and integrated into action, such as the fiber-optic waterfall parting "like beaded curtains."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (race against sunrise) and escalation is driven by Kaida's agency, narrowing options through discoveries like the ruby flake. Cost is legible in the time pressure, but the external conflict with autocrats remains slightly off-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of ascension as understanding emerges organically through events and the final image of descending, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext is rich in the throne's redefinition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature of "futuristic nostalgia" that controls rhythm under pressure. No head-hopping or dialogue issues, but minor elision in transitions prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "fruit that looked like crystallized stars" enhances clarity without muddle, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of ascension as descending is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without gimmickry, integrated through character and closure.</comment>
