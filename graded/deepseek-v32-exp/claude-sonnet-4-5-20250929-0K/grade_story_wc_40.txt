<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's reticence is consistently embodied and her motivation to decode the pattern drives key choices; her decision to testify is earned through prior causality with visible cost in her fear, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in her readiness to "translate silence into understanding"; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, and the crystal constrains tactics, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The library and crystal function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency under the Accumulative lens, with cost legible in her confrontation with the Council; the tightening forecloses options and reweights the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges through particulars like the crystal and children's speech, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer ("breaking was sometimes just another word for bloom") that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a lyrical, perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure and purposeful elision (e.g., "liminal space") are taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and supports propulsion, especially in peak beats like the crystal's refraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes language evolution with organic growth in a non-obvious way; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
