<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Petrov's motivation is clear and rooted in exile guilt, with interiority shown through chess patterns and tapestry decoding. His change is earned by the decoded message, culminating in a smile that signifies forgiveness. Micro-choices under pressure, like tracing patterns and winnowing threads, reveal hierarchy of values. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaw complicates closure with credible endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with Petrov's smile as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), reconfiguring his stance with felt cost. Under Accumulative lens, pattern of decoding builds to realization. Orientation is clear early with village and Petrov. Cost is legible in "smiled" after disgrace; lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Time-frozen village and tapestry are vivid, sensory details selective (suspended rain, moth-eaten fabric). Environment pressures choices by constraining time and focus, charging final image. POV bias filters through Petrov's expertise; spatial choreography coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of self-forgiveness escalates under Accumulative lens through decoding agency, tightening with each thread deciphered. Cost is legible when time resumes and Petrov smiles, foreclosing his path of guilt. No coincidence; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness emerges through imperfections in tapestry and time-freeze, not direct statement. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via Petrov's realization. Subtext in woven hush; earned wisdom from concrete struggle without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature (chess tutor's mindset, fidgeting). Prose rhythm controlled under pressure; purposeful compression in decoding. No head-hopping; voice consistent and apt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language purposeful (e.g., "silver needles"). Sentences advance story; no artifacts obscuring closure. Read-aloud test passes with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-freeze, woven hush, and chess metaphor feels inevitable. Tropes transformed through specific details like decoding frayed threads. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure reweights prior material.</comment>
