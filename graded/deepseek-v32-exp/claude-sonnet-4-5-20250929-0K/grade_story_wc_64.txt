<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Marta's blithe demeanor and obsessive decoding are consistently embodied, with interior contradictions (cheerfulness vs. hidden depth) acting in scene. Her final choice to visit graves is earned by the chess loss revelation, with cost felt in the cold light of understanding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (Marta's plan to uncover truths) with conceptual cost legible in "the game was just beginning." Causal lens holds tightly from chess loss to decoding breakthrough, and orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice: the cobalt silo's velveteen gloom focuses revelation, and recurring objects (tapestry, case) charge the final image. Sensory details (moonlight, peeling paint) are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marta's agency under causal lens: chess loss tightens into decoding realization, foreclosing her prior approach. Cost is visible in her emotional shift and the uncharted echoes awaiting discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of hidden intentions emerges from particulars (chess strategy, tapestry symbols) without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material through the resonant "game beginning again" image, offering a non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct—lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature (noticing patterns like chess moves). No head-hopping; elision (e.g., frayed letter) is taught and pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control (e.g., "velveteen gloom, soft and smothering"). No loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent and advances stakes without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of chess, cemetery keeping, and decoding feels inevitable. Risk-taking in structure (internal revelation) heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity (sovereign case, tapestry) avoids template plots.</comment>
