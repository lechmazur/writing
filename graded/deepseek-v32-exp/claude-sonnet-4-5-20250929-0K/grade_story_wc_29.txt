<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure; her "cautiously hopeful" trait constrains actions, and her final interference feels earned by prior causality with visible cost when the tricksters shift their game.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot coheres under a causal lens with clear orientation; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the charts rearrange into a spiral, legible with cost in the tricksters' intrigued laughter, and the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral; the radio station and astronomical charts constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory detail filtered through Mara's professional bias, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mara's agency under the causal lens; her broadcast directly tightens options by redirecting the tricksters, with cost legible in the campus calming, and no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of coexistence with cosmic entities emerges implicitly through events and subtext; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the tricksters' shift, avoiding moralizing but with minor abstraction in the conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct with a stable POV and perceptual signature; Mara's professional lexicon and rhythmic control under pressure are consistent, and any elision in celestial signals is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with high information density; no major artifacts or loops, though minor rhythmic uniformity in descriptive passages slightly dulls peak beats, but clarity and momentum are maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cosmic tricksters and radio signals feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in blending genres heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity in details like subsonic frequencies avoids derivative premises.</comment>
