<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Layla's characterization is deeply integrated with her motives; her internal conflict between past trauma and present resistance is embodied in micro-choices like tracing the tessera and speaking names. The final choice to create the memorial is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her shaking and the regime's looming threat. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her mechanical hands cradling fragments, showcasing a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with a Resonant Reconfiguration as the retrocognitive loop loosens and others join Layla, shifting time forward under a causal lens. Cost is legible in "something shifted in the air" and the felt risk of the regime's return. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the mosaic pattern teaches early, paying off at closure without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting constrains choices and charges the final image; the plaza's "shattered sky" and mosaic fragments pressure Layla's actions, while the minaret tessera returns with reweighted meaning. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV, such as the "blue tile fragment" pulsing with memory, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Layla's agency under the causal lens, from passive reliving to actively arranging tiles and speaking names, which narrows options and fractures the trap. The dominant stake of memory preservation tightens through her choices, with cost legible in the regime's implied pursuit and the emotional weight of naming the dead.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars like the tessera and naming ritual, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to mercy and resistance without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures, such as her steel hands cradling fragments, and the final image of "tessera-studded testament" reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature evident in phrases like "sky fractured like broken glass" and rhythmic control under pressure. Elision is taught early through the mosaic patterns and paid off at closure, with no head-hopping; dialogue, though minimal, carries subtext in the naming ceremony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "weaponize empathy," without muddle in peak beats. The read-aloud test passes with natural rhythm, and the final line resonates without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes retrocognitive punishment and gentle radicalism with specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, such as augmented hands used for preservation, and risk-taking in the mosaic structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
