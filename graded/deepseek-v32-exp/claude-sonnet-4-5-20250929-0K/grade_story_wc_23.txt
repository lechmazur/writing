<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in personal loss, driving her to build the compass; her micro-choices under pressure, like wiring the magnetic cores, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final endurance—navigating what remains—is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the "raw solace." Interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., "tug like fish-line wrapped around her heart," avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost: Mara's realization that the migration targets time, not place, reweights the premise, and her decision to build for the future forecloses passive longing. Causal lens holds tightly from phone calls to device activation; orientation is immediate, and the persistent constraint of the pull shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image: the dead station's broken dome and salvaged tools pressure Mara's building, while the bronze foot's patina shifts meaning from direction to duration. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, e.g., "starlight through the station's broken dome," avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation under causal lens is driven by Mara's agency: building the device narrows options and leads to the revelation about temporal density. Cost is legible in her endurance of the pull and the "raw solace" of her purpose. Dominant stake—understanding the migration—tightens meaningfully through her actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the reverse migration as a collective bending of time through memory, answered non-literally by Mara's decision to "navigate what remains." Subtext operates in the phone calls and the bronze's decay, resisting moralizing; the final image reweights loss without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature reflecting Mara's navigator mindset. Dialogue in phone calls is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Prose rhythm controls pressure, e.g., "The work took hours, her hands moving with muscle memory," with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and propulsion, with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "chemical time encoded in decay." Syntax varies naturally, and peak beats like the device humming remain clear without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality lies in the non-obvious synthesis of reverse migration as temporal gravity, transformed through specific details like the patina bronze and Mara's loss. Risk-taking in the conceptual premise heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
