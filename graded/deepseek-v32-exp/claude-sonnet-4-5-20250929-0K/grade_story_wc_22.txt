<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Coachman's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion in micro-choices like scattering seeds based on bird calls. His internal contradiction (feeling confined space containing infinity) acts in scene, and final renunciation is earned with visible cost in the transformation effort.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot under accumulative/textural lens coheres with causality in seed-planting based on bird instructions; closure lands with Conceptual Repricing as seeds begin reclamation, cost felt in the implied harmony from war's aftermath. Orientation is clear early, and lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details (dew-slick wood, bird calls) and constrains choices, as jetty's micro-environment guides planting locations; it charges the final image of potential bloom, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes of reclamation escalate through protagonist's agency in fertilizing based on bird calls, narrowing options with each seed type; cost is legible in the effort through twilight and the submerged concord's role, driving escalation under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of life from death emerges through particulars like bird songs and seed planting, not direct statement; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer with the image of seeds working, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical with stable POV; perceptual signature is selective (noticing bird calls, seed shapes), and dialogue with bird in dead languages adds texture without head-hopping, taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and dense with varied sentence structures; no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle in peak beats like the planting sequence. Information density is high, advancing story with clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (coachman, bird calls, dead languages) feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative structure and dead language use heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure is legible with transformation.</comment>
