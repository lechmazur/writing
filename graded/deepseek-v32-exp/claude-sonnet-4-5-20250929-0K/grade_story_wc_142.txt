<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's characterization is strong with clear internal conflict (dual allegiance) and embodied emotions; her decision to reorganize with graffiti is earned by prior causality and shows micro-choices under pressure. The foundation stone chip anchors her motivation, and her final choice to teach the newcomer reweights her role with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a conceptual repricing as Marina reconfigures her role by teaching graffiti reading, charged by the weight of the foundation stone chip and "hopeful desperation." The causal-hybrid lens holds tightly from her actions to community resistance, with orientation clear early and no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The raft city setting is vivid with sensory details (calliope music, fried dough smell) that pressure choices and charge the final image; the graffiti walls and foundation stone chip act as micro-settings that constrain tactics and deepen resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marina's agency in reorganizing with graffiti, leading to community resistance and parades that block developers; the cost is legible in her "hopeful desperation" and the constant motion required for survival, tightening stakes under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of living culture versus preservation emerges organically from symbols like graffiti and the foundation stone, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through Marina's teaching without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature focused on carnival logic; dialogue is natural and goal-driven, and the voice remains consistent under pressure, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with varied rhythm and high information density; no loops or scaffolds, and figurative language (e.g., "endless, defiant dance") enhances momentum without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes gentrification resistance with a unique raft city setting, offering a fresh angle through specific details like encoded graffiti; emotional truth and risk-taking in the closure heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
