<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied actions like unbraiding the rope showing her methodical nature. The final change is earned by prior causality, though lack of internal contradiction limits higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—the door now makes sense—and cost is felt in the reconfiguration. Causal lens holds strongly, with orientation anchored early and constraints shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and POV-filtered, with the clock tower room and rope constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like brass gears and moonlight enhance atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maren's agency in reconfiguring the rope, narrowing options and leading to a legible cost in the merged narratives. Stake is clear early and tightens under causal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of clarity from confusion emerges through events and images, like the rope's fables of absence, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. No moralizing or abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—methodical and archival—reflected in prose rhythm and diction. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Concept of fables of absence and narrative reconfiguration is fresh and synthesized uniquely, with risk-taking in structure that heightens stakes without gimmickry. Inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
