<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is rooted in her "brightly attentive" trait, which compels her investigation and culminates in her decision to lie and join the lost ones; the final choice is earned by prior causality with visible cost, as she forecloses her old life. Internal conflict is shown through her duty versus her discovery, embodied in micro-choices like trembling hands and the deliberate lie. The resolution carries felt cost in her self-archiving, scaled to the story's length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with conceptual cost as Elena archives herself, reconfiguring her existence under a causal lens; the plot progresses through because/therefore linkages from clues to discovery, with orientation anchored early. The persistent constraint of the 1408 pattern shapes tactics, and cost is legible in the final image of her materializing the patch and the system humming without her.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered through selective sensory details like "ghost-light" and holographic timelines, with the archive room and patch acting as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. The patch's recurrence and tactile presence ("warm despite existing only as photons") deepen atmosphere, while coordinates and degraded files integrate environment into action, reflecting Elena's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally from investigating disappearances to confronting a memetic hazard, driven by Elena's agency in accessing the locked directory and choosing to join the lost ones; cost is unmistakable in her resignation and self-archiving, which forecloses her path. The dominant stake of truth-seeking tightens through her discoveries, narrowing options until the final decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from motifs of memory and transcendence, with subtext in "hearing the old songs" and the patch's symbolism; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Elena's archiving, reweighting prior material without moralizing. The conceptual cost of joining a collective consciousness lingers with meaningful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in Elena's professional yet poetic voice; diction and syntax reflect her urgency, as in "her hands trembled," and elision in degraded files is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but natural, and psychic distance shifts intentionally with emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and clear syntax; no loops or artifacts obscure causality, and figurative language like "ghost-light" serves atmosphere without muddle. Information is layered efficiently, as in the reveal of the Perihelion's true fate, and closure is sharpened by concise, image-driven lines.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story synthesizes corporate dystopia, sci-fi, and mystery with originality, transforming tropes through specific details like the memetic hazard and mathematical residue; risk-taking in the quiet, transcendent ending heightens stakes without gimmickry. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, grounded in character-driven choices.</comment>
