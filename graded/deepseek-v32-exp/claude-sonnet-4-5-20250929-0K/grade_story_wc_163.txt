<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot builds causally under an accumulative/textural lens to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the city's purpose is reconfigured. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the decision to join the city despite the shutdown. The lens holds without ambiguity, and the closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral, constraining choices and charging the final image.
