<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Celeste's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as a crystal gazer, with interiority shown through embodied actions like psychometry reading. Her final choice to redistribute unused love is earned by prior discoveries, demonstrating micro-choices under pressure. However, minor lack of deeper internal contradiction limits the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, as Celeste's decision to redistribute love reconfigures meaning with felt cost. Causality is tight, from investigation to realization, and orientation is clear early. The cost is legible in her understanding that moments have passed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice, such as the small booth forcing thorough search, and charges the final image with the projected map. Sensory details like dust motes and brass rail are selective and purposeful, integrated into action without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of repurposing unused love escalates through Celeste's agency, from discovery to decision, under the accumulative lens. Cost is clear in her realization that return is impossible, forcing a trade-off. Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unused love emerges organically from images and events, such as the letters and film strips, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through redistribution, reweighting prior material with purposeful ambiguity and emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, selective observation. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and elision like the psychometry vision is taught and pays off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "celluloid amber" is consistent and purposeful, though minor purple tendencies exist. Clarity and propulsion are maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, synthesizing unused love as a tangible substance with specific details like the incubation chamber. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, and risk-taking in the conceptual frame heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
