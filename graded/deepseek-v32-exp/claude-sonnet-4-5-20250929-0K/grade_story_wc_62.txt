<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete with embodied emotion; her motivation to understand grief intensifies under pressure, leading to an earned change in perspective. Micro-choices, like unrolling the ribbon and writing her poem, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, and the final renunciation of isolated carving is causally rooted in prior beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost: the protagonist reconfigures her approach to grief through the final poem. Accumulative lens holds, building via imagery and dialogue. Orientation is clear within 120 words; causality is tight, with Marcus's guidance driving the change. Cost is legible in the ending image of collective memory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful; the greenhouse and monarchs create pools of copper light that charge the final image. Sensory details are filtered through POV, with the ribbon and greenhouse constraining choices. The environment actively shapes tactics, as the greenhouse becomes a studio for redefined carving.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens: her dialogue with Marcus deepens understanding, narrowing options from isolated grief to collective thread. Cost is legible in her altered stance, foreclosing prior methods. Stakes are signaled early and tighten through one meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the ribbon and butterfly migrations, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to collective grief. Subtext operates in gestures and images, avoiding moralizing. The final poem reweights prior material without statement, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature. Voice modulates under pressure, and dialogue carries subtext. Rhythm and diction are controlled, with purposeful compression in peak beats. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear, even in climax. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive, with no artifacts obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in a non-obvious synthesis of gravestone carving, poetic legacy, and spectral mentorship. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details anchor universals, transforming familiar tropes.</comment>
