<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her internal conflict is shown through contradictory impulses, such as bleak exhilaration in her hunt. The relationship with Dr. Vahedi applies secondary pressure, and her final stance is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in the final image of "pooling like light inside unopened stones." The accumulative/textural lens holds, with pattern density increasing through recurring motifs. Orientation is early and clear, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the floating observatory and geode constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as "frost-rimed window" and "circuit breakers clicked." The environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Mira's hunt for unused potential, escalating through her agency under the accumulative lens. A meaningful deepening occurs when she detects the standing wave, foreclosing options with cost legible in her adjustment of thrusters. Pressure coheres and tightens without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the geode and perturbation theory, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of unrealized possibilities pooling. Subtext operates in implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in phrases like "auroras writhe like wedding veils catching fire." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with voice coherence under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "potential energy, locked in stone." Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of trauma, science, and philosophy, with tropes transformed through specific choices. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The closure feels inevitable in hindsight, with emotional specificity.</comment>
