<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's profession and the Duchess's grief are concretely embodied, with internal contradictions like the Duchess's projected presence versus unmarked palms. The final choice—Maren proposing to stop explaining—earns its cost through prior intimacy, and the Duchess's weeping shows credible emotional progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration as the Duchess begins healing, with cost legible in her weeping and the thread as a "bridge." Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the single-scene structure tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the finale: the garden's "patterns that looked almost like writing" mirror the thematic mapping, and the crimson thread evolves from a tactile anchor to a closure image. Sensory details (bitter perfume, rust and gold) are filtered through Maren's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—the Duchess's emotional return—escalates under accumulative lens via Maren's intimate intervention, forcing a trade-off (stopping explanations) with visible cost in the Duchess's release. Agency drives the deepening, and the thread reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of absence and return emerges through particulars like the thread and roses, avoiding moralizing; the ending offers a non-literal answer via "map your own returning," reweighting prior material with poignant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV on Maren with distinct perceptual signature ("geography of healing"). Dialogue carries subtext ("I tend them by projecting my presence there"), and prose rhythm modulates with emotional pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language ("lanterns fading into the fog like dying stars") is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Concept of writing obituaries for the living is a fresh synthesis, transformed through specific details (crimson thread, projected presence). Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
