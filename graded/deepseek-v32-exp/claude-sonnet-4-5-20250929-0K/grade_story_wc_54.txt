<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lena's curiosity and functional creativity are consistently shown through her observations and drafting, with micro-choices like extracting the sextant piece revealing her values. However, her characterization lacks deep internal contradiction or flaws, making the final choice feel slightly idealized rather than earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing via Lena's proposal, redefining the terminal's value with cost legible in her effort and risk of rejection. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through water stain patterns and the sextant's metaphorical weight, leading inevitably to the transformative vision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport terminal is vividly specific, with cracked marble and water stains constraining Lena's choices by dictating her hydroponic and power generation ideas. Sensory details like starlight and crystalline deposits are purposefully filtered through her engineer POV, charging the final image of regeneration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from surveying for demolition to envisioning metamorphosis, driven by Lena's agency in mapping water flows and drafting the proposal. Cost is unmistakable in her all-night effort and the palpable risk of rejection, tightening options under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of regeneration emerges organically from water stains and the sextant's symbolism, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the proposal's hope. Subtext in lines like "water finds its way" deepens without moralizing, reweighting decay into possibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Lena's engineering mindset, evident in phrases like "cataloging failure points." Prose rhythm varies purposefully, though occasional elevated diction ("melancholy romance") slightly strains voice consistency under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and varied syntax, advancing story through concrete images like "cotton candy stains in pink spirals." No loops or scaffolds; figurative language, such as "ghost rivers of purpose," coheres without muddling peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing decay and hope through specific details like water damage mapping and the sextant, making the transformation feel inevitable. Risk-taking in the quiet, conceptual ending heightens stakes without gimmickry, offering a fresh angle on abandonment narratives.</comment>
