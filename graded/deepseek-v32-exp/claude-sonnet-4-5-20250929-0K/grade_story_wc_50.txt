<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and rooted in his locksmith background, with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure. His obsession with the timer mechanism drives the plot, and his final action of restoring it is earned by prior causality. The line "wonder itself was a resource that needed storing" embodies his unique perspective without diagnostic label-speak. No significant weaknesses; characterization is cohesive and compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot follows an accumulative/textural lens, building through patterns of light and reflection to a resonant reconfiguration closure. The timer's restoration and the echoes' revelation occur on-page with felt cost (communal hope amid survival). Causality is tight: because Marcus studies reflections, he reverse-engineers the timer. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The marble cavern is vividly specific, with sensory details (calcite deposits, moonlight filtering) that constrain choices and charge the final image. The setting pressures tactics, as reflection angles enable the harvest of echoes. Micro-setting elements like the timer and tools are integrated into action. No generic or ornamental description; environment shapes the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of survival vs. wonder escalates through Marcus's agency under the accumulative lens, with one meaningful tightening when he completes the timer. Cost is legible in his isolation and the community's transformed perspective. The reversal tests commitment, and the resolution is earned without coincidence. Pressure coheres from initial discovery to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of wonder as resilience emerges organically through events and images, not direct statement. The final echo revelation offers a non-literal answer to enduring hardship, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like Marcus's muttered line about storing wonder. Complexity arises from particulars, avoiding simplistic binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Marcus's selective attention to patterns and mechanisms. Voice is consistent and slightly poetic, modulating with emotional intensity. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and concise, with high information density and varied sentence structures. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; metaphors like "reflections bloomed across the stone" are coherent and purposeful. Read-aloud ear test passes with natural acceleration. Line-level craft supports momentum without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The concept of harvesting temporal echoes in marble is fresh and non-obvious, synthesizing ideas into an organic narrative. Tropes are transformed through specific grounded choices in character and setting. Risk-taking in the quiet, lyrical ending heightens stakes without gimmickry. Originality feels inevitable in hindsight, with no derivative premises.</comment>
