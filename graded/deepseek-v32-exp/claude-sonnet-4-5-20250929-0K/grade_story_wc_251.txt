Danny's internal conflict is embodied in his hesitation and decision to think freely, earned through the conversation. The final choice to question paths is motivated by prior causality with visible cost. Minor hairline slip in Danny's quick shift, but closure choice is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise as Miss Chen's queen move symbolizes the rebellion's start, reconfiguring options with felt cost under an Accumulative lens. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The persistent constraint of the humble rebellion shapes tactics and the final image of the library as a lighthouse.</comment>
