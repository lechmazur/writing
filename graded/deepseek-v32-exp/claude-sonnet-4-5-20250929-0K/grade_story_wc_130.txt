<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, driving her choices under pressure. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values. Final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in "the buried optimism... breaking surface." Contradictory impulses act in scene, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elara accepts unsolvable systems, with cost legible in the final image. Inferred accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, and persistent constraint of loss shapes tactics. Orientation is clear early, and structure is coherent for a single-scene, single-POV narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with the cavern orchard constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered, such as "moonlight struck the damaged surfaces." Environment mirrors internal states and supports theme, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding loss is signaled early and escalates through Elara's agency with the glass eyes and equations. Under accumulative lens, density increases with a meaningful deepening that changes knowledge. Cost is unmistakable in her altered stance, and resolution is earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of ambiguous loss and mathematics of emotion emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in gestures and silence. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of "growing toward its own mysterious proof," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct with poetic, mathematical diction, reflecting Elara's perceptual signature. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision (e.g., prime numbers sequence) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping, and prose is character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats. Sentences advance story and atmosphere, and closure image is undulled by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes mathematics, conjuring, and emotional loss in a non-obvious way that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, and transformation through character choice is evident.</comment>
