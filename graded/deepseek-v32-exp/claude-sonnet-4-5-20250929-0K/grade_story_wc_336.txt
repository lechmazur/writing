<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as a weaver, with embodied emotions (e.g., "weathered hands," "aching knees") and micro-choices under pressure. The final planting is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction is minimal, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with cost ("exhausted and triumphant"), and the causal lens holds tightly from feeling the thin boundary to planting the seed. Orientation is immediate, and the persistent constraint of the thinning world shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the parapet and waterfall constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory details like "mist beading on her silver hair" are filtered through Mara's POV, though not all elements are irreplaceable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early, and escalation is driven by Mara's agency in coaxing the resisting essence, with cost legible in her blood sacrifice and exhaustion. One meaningful tightening is sufficient under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of preserving wonder emerges organically through events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer in the planted seed. Subtext is strong, though some descriptions edge toward overtness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctively lyrical, with perceptual signature clear in Mara's biased observations. Rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping, and elision (e.g., world-weaving) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, though minor purple hues prevent perfection. Propulsion is clear throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes weaving worlds and preserving wonder with specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the magical concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional truth avoids derivative patterns.</comment>
