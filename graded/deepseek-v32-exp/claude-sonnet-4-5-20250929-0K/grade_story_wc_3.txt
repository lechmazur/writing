<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Emilia's characterization is strong with concrete interiority and embodied emotion; her scientific mind conflicting with mystical elements feels authentic. The final choice to continue Harrow's work is earned through prior causality, with cost visible in her grief transformation. Minor slip: initial rejection of anthropomorphism is slightly straightforward, but doesn't undermine closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost felt in Emilia's realization and decision; the accumulative/textural lens holds, building through imagery and reflection. Orientation is clear early, and the seed's growth drives causality. Persistent constraint: the arbor and seed shape tactics, with cost in the "taste of lightning" and planning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "rust-brown metal" and "electromagnetic taste" filtering through Emilia's POV. The magnetic arbor and seed constrain choices and charge the final image. Micro-setting elements (e.g., the fruit) are integral to the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding transition) escalates through Emilia's agency under the accumulative lens: planting the seed, touching the fruit, eating it. Cost is legible in her grief transformation and commitment. One meaningful tightening suffices, though escalation is more density-based than causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of transition emerges organically through events and images like the seed and cuneiform analogy. Subtext operates in implication, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, e.g., "nothing was ever lost, only changed."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice blends scientific precision with poetic reflection. Dialogue (Harrow's whisper) is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., seed's growth) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language like "taste of lightning" is purposeful and clear. Sentences advance story and character; closure image is sharp and unobscured.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in fresh synthesis of floating arbor, knowledge fruit, and transition physics. Tropes are transformed through specific details like Sumerian tablets and magnetic fields. Risk-taking in lyrical approach heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; closure feels inevitable.</comment>
