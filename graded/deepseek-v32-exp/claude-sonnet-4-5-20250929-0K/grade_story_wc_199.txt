<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Miren's transformation from orderly sorter to fluid part of the mystery is earned through concrete interiority and embodied emotion; her motivation intensifies credibly, with micro-choices like charting leaves and prodding the moonstone speck revealing hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative drive lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration as Miren becomes the message, with cost legible in her identity shift and the arbor's widened reach; orientation is anchored early, and causality flows through pattern-building without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image; the ashen skyborne arbor functions as micro-setting, with sensory details like "pale branches" and "copper light" filtered through Miren's POV to mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under accumulative lens through Miren's agency in decoding leaves and building monuments; cost is visible in her transformation and the arbor's response, narrowing options from sorting to active ritual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance and repair emerges through particulars like leaf patterns and seed mandalas, with subtext in implication; ending offers a non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through Miren's embodiment of the message.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and consistent, modulating with emotional intensity; dialogue is minimal but natural when present, supporting subtext and advancement.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "veins through perpetual twilight" is purposeful, and peak beats maintain clarity with strong propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of folklore and post-apocalyptic elements feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes, with specific details like moonstone dust and seed sorting transforming tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
