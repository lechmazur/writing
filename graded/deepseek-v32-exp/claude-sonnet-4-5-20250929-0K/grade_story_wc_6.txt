<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's characterization is deeply rooted in her contradictory impulses as the arsonist's daughter turned firefighter, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., sharing the coin) revealing her hierarchy of values. Elena's transformation is earned through embodied emotion and credible irrationality, avoiding stock phrasing. The final choice to graft scars into wholeness is motivated by prior causality with visible cost in Elena's softened shoulders and deepened breath.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elena accepts her scars as "singing," reconfiguring meaning with felt cost under the accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is anchored early (who, where, when by ~120 words), and the drive lens holds without ambiguity. The persistent constraint of Maya's past shapes tactics and the final image, with cost legible in the "kelp-drift peace" and Elena's smile.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and black sand function as micro-setting that constrains choices (e.g., wading into water, pressing sand) and charges the final image of "dark stars." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Maya's professional awareness (e.g., "trained senses attuned to every shift in wind"). Spatial choreography is coherent, with bodies and objects tracking cleanly across moves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency, with Maya's guidance deepening Elena's stake in self-acceptance through concrete actions (e.g., pouring sand, placing the coin). The cost is unmistakable in Elena's trembling hands and transformed stance, foreclosing her path of rigid self-loathing. Pressure coheres and tightens through a meaningful cadence shift to "they're singing."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like grafting and obsidian, with subtext in objects (coin, sand) implying transformation without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to scars as music, reweighting prior material through Elena's realization. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and avoids sentimentality, embracing complexity through Maya's shame and compassion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and single (Maya's), with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, rhythmic prose that reflects her professional and emotional state. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext (e.g., Elena's whispered doubts). Purposeful compression (e.g., "scars can sing") is taught and paid off at closure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without scaffolding or loops. Figurative language (e.g., "reverse stars") is coherent and voice-motivated, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Read-aloud ear test passes with natural modulation, and closure image is sharpened by concise, specific diction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of arsonist's daughter firefighter, obsidian lagoon, and grafting metaphor feels inevitable and fresh, transforming tropes through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure reconfigures meaning with bold specificity. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, anchored in verifiable detail like the Korean coin.</comment>
