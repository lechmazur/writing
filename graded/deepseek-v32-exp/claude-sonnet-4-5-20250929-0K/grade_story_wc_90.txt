<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mei's genetic modification and obsession with shadow work are vividly embodied, with micro-choices under pressure driving the narrative; her final decision is earned by prior causality, though Akio's shift from critic to ally feels slightly abrupt, slightly reducing motivation depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as the dimension opens, under a Hybrid lens; orientation is clear early, and causality holds from Mei's actions to the climax, but the swift resolution of Akio's opposition slightly softens the cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship and photographs constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details like the "faint shimmer of long-dried tears" are selective and purposeful, enhancing atmosphere without overwhelming momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mei's agency in activating the apparatus, with cost legible in the emotional complexity at closure; pressure coheres under the Hybrid lens, though Akio's quick acceptance reduces middle-beat tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of facing collective grief emerges organically from events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the "terrible beauty of completion" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; dialogue is natural and goal-driven, and rhythmic control supports pressure, though minor exposition in Akio's lines slightly flattens voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold, and figurative language like "ghostly resolve" is clear and purposeful, though minor redundancy in "recycled spaceship" description occurs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and synthesized with emotional truth; risk-taking in blending sci-fi and philosophical elements heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
