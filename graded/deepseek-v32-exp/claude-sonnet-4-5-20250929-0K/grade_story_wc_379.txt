<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Marissa's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as her "sandstorm calm" during preparations. Her final choice to prioritize community over legal action is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the unity against the developers. Secondary characters like Thomas apply relevant pressure, but their development is functional rather than deep, limiting the score slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly, with the locket discovery leading logically to the mailbox reveal and community mobilization. Closure is a decisive change (community uniting with evidence) with felt cost in the final image of shared voices. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the plot avoids coincidences, earning the resolution through established beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the courtyard and mailroom constraining choices—the mailbox key moment directly advances the plot. Sensory details like "amber and gold" dawn light are purposeful and filtered through Marissa's POV, charging the final image of the vibrant courtyard as a sanctuary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (saving the community) escalate through Marissa's agency, from finding the locket to unlocking the mailbox, narrowing options and revealing evidence. Cost is legible in the community's unified stance against the developers, with no reliance on coincidence; the tightening feels inevitable under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of listening and community emerges through particulars like the locket and storytelling gathering, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"community itself was the strongest defense"—reweighting prior material through the image of shared voices.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with Marissa's perceptual signature clear in phrases like "sandstorm calm." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (e.g., Thomas's revelation about mailboxes), but minor convergence in voice under pressure prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic, with high information density and no artifacts affecting closure. Sentences like "The sandstorm would pass. They would remain" use varied syntax to support momentum, and figurative language is coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise feels fresh through specific synthesis—thrift store curation and community mystery—with risks in quiet closure that heighten stakes. The locket and mailbox are transformed beyond tropes via grounded choices, though slight familiarity in the "underdog community" arc limits originality.</comment>
