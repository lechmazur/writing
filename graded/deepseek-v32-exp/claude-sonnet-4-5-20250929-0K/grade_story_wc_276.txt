<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's cool-headed patience and determination are consistently embodied through micro-choices like shaping silence and holding still under pressure, with her motivation rooted in past experience. The final catch is earned by prior causality, and the transformative cost is legible as the echo crystallizes in her chest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as the echo crystallizes internally and patterns reassert, with felt cost under an accumulative/textural lens. The rail spike and silence method shape tactics, and orientation is clear early, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated, with the sound wave garden and acoustic flowers constraining choices and charging the final image through sensory detail. The rail spike as a micro-setting object anchors gravity and hums with thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled around catching the echo, escalating under accumulative lens through density increases like constellations drifting and flowers zigzagging. Mara's agency in voicing silence drives the escalation, with cost legible in her internal transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of silence, sound, and emotion, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the crystallized echo. Subtext operates in the negative space of silence, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that filters setting through Mara's expertise. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and purposeful elision in silence-shaping pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "feral lullaby" is coherent and purposeful, and peak beats maintain clarity with strong propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes emotion, sound, and myth with originality, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative design and poetic voice heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the core concept is fully committed.</comment>
