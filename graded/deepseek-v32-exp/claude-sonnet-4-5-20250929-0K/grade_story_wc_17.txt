<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and rooted in her grandfather's legacy, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. Her final decision to continue mapping is earned by prior causality, with the cost of legacy feeling lighter but present. Interiority is concrete, such as her hands trembling at the film negative, showing internal conflict without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows an accumulative/textural drive with coherent causality from inciting incident to closure. Closure is a conceptual repricing where Maya understands she must dream with the walls, with cost legible in the burden shift. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the ivy-veiled passage and library filtering through Maya's POV. The environment constrains choices and charges the final image, as the ivy acts as a nervous system. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Maya's agency, driven by her discoveries of diaries and film negative, narrowing options and changing knowledge. Cost is legible in her trembling and renewed purpose. Under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of legacy and memory emerges naturally from events and images, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Maya's realization about dreaming with the walls. Subtext operates in whispers and the film negative, inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent with Maya's perceptual signature, controlled under pressure. POV is stable single, with no head-hopping. Prose rhythm and diction reflect her profession and emotional state, such as in the description of walls holding memory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts like loops or scaffold. Sentences advance story and character, with purposeful figurative language. No clarity issues in peak beats, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality is high with a fresh synthesis of echo cartography and walls dreaming, transformed through specific details like the ivy as nervous system. Emotional truth and risk-taking heighten stakes without gimmickry, and the premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
