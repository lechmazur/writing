<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority is concrete and embodied, with his narration as resistance revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. Emma's blank facade cracking is earned through prior causality, and their relationship as crucible forces a decisive change with visible cost. The final choice to abandon the performance is motivated by accumulated grief and connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where emotional breakthrough reconfigures the "remade hush" with felt cost on-page ("Tears came, unauthorized but no longer illegal"). Accumulative drive lens holds, with pattern of narration breaking down leading to reweighted silence. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image: turbines generate "renewable indifference" mirroring internal states, and the dried flowers evolve from brittle objects to symbols of witnessed grief. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Marcus's POV, with the farmhouse and turbines pressuring the emotional void.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of emotional authenticity escalates under accumulative lens through Marcus's narrated actions provoking Emma's response. Agency in Marcus's decision to narrate and then abandon it forces a trade-off with cost ("Tears came"). One meaningful tightening from performance to genuine feeling reweights options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of grief and humanity emerges through particulars like the dried flowers and narration, not statement. Subtext operates in gesture and silence (Emma's mask cracking). Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of carving in silence, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Marcus's theatrical narration. Voice modulates under pressure, abandoning performance at climax. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in Emma's sparse lines. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentence-level propulsion accelerating emotional beats. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; metaphors like "wood curls fell like tiny prayers" are consistent and purposeful. Closure image is clear and uncluttered by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh angle on emotional control dystopia, transformed through specific lived detail like narration as resistance. Risk-taking with theatrical monotone heightens stakes without gimmickry. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with the "remade hush" concept fully committed.</comment>
