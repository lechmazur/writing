<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied, with micro-choices under pressure, such as striking the tuning fork to feel vibrations, revealing her hierarchy of values. Her motivation to find new expression after trauma is clear and intensifies, compelling higher-stakes choices like the public installation. The final renunciation of her old life as a vocalist is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the thermal maps of grief and hope. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her simultaneous grief and hope flickering in the heat patterns.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural drive lens holds, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration where Mara's body becomes an instrument, reweighting silence with cost legible in the final image of the tuning fork case pressed to her heart. Orientation is clear within 120 words, anchoring who, where, and when. The pattern of heat-mapping builds density, and the closure effect charges the final image with undeniable conceptual cost. Persistent constraints like her lost voice shape tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory constrains choices and charges the final image, serving as a micro-setting that alters tactics through its fractured walls and frozen surfaces. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's POV, such as the "cold panes" and "phantom thunder in her skull." The environment subtly mirrors internal states, with the conservatory's ruins reflecting her emotional landscape. Specificity is high, with the setting evolving causally from the storm's damage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative lens, as she progresses from private experiments to public installation, narrowing options and changing knowledge. The dominant stake of internal expression tightens through her choices, with cost legible in the thermal maps capturing her heartbeat and memories. Pressure coheres and grows, culminating in a meaningful deepening that reweights the stake with visible price. No coincidence resolves; turns arise from character choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the tuning fork's resonance and heat patterns, offering a non-literal answer to silence and survival. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, like Mara pressing the fork case to her heart, inviting reflection without moralizing. The core concept of "unshaken marvels" integrates through specific particulars, deepening character arc. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and avoids sentimentality through embodied cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in Mara's biased attention to vibration and heat. Prose has a textured rhythm, modulating with emotional intensity, such as the "endless internal roar" contrasting with the "pure A-note." Dialogue is absent, but internal voice is coherent and specific. Any elision is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and propulsion, with varied sentence openings and paragraph lengths creating natural rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; metaphors like "silence become symphony" are coherent and purposeful. Line-level craft is flawless, with strong verbs and specific nouns advancing story momentum. Read-aloud ear test passes smoothly, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of heat-mapping emotions with personal trauma feels inevitable and fresh, transforming familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, as the installation reconfigures meaning. Originality lies in the non-obvious angle on communication, with emotional specificity avoiding generic templates. The core premise is fully committed to, with bold choices that cohere.</comment>
