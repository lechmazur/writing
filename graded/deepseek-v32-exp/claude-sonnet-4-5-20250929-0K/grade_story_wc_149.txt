<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and rooted in family debt, with his final choice earned through prior causality. Eleanora's backstory is effectively integrated, though her exposition slightly reduces immediacy. The bead's hum and his decision to plant it show embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with dawn breaking and Eleanora's release, a resonant reconfiguration under the causal lens. The plot coheres with because/therefore linkages, from Marcus's entry to the bead's burial. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting constrains choices and charges the closure, with vivid sensory details like "fogged glass panes" and "silver apples." The environment pressures Marcus's actions and mirrors internal states, such as the endless night lifting with forgiveness. Specificity is purposeful and integrated into the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marcus's agency under the causal lens, from seeking answers to actively planting the bead. The dominant stake of repaying the debt tightens meaningfully, with cost legible in the dawn's arrival and Eleanora's release. No coincidental resolutions; pressure coheres to the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of forgiveness and love emerge organically through events and images, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "morning broke" reweighting prior darkness. Subtext operates in Eleanora's grief and Marcus's release, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, such as the bead "humming against his palm." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, advancing plot and subtext. Prose rhythm varies purposefully, though minor register consistency issues in peak beats prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with rhythmic control and vivid imagery. No major artifacts or loops; figurative language like "mournful elation" is coherent and purposeful. Sentence-level craft supports momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard and ghost bride premise offers a fresh synthesis, transforming tropes through specific details like the stone bead and resonant awakenings. Emotional truth and risk-taking heighten stakes, though some elements feel slightly familiar. Closure feels earned and inevitable.</comment>
