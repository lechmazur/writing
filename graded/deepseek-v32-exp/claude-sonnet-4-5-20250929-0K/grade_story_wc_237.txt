<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to transform scars into stories is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion shown through crystallization under stress.

The interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The plot follows a causal lens with clear linkage from fear to crystallization to transformation using runes.

Orientation is anchored early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, supporting a resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
