<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her hyperawareness of gradual change. Her interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure, such as collecting and placing objects. The final realization about witness feels earned by prior causality, though contradictory impulses could be more pronounced in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a resonant reconfiguration—the house exhales and Mara's understanding shifts—under the accumulative/textural lens. Cost is legible in the transformation, and orientation is anchored early. The lens holds without ambiguity, with the pattern of displaced objects culminating in a decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail, such as the bay and house, filtered through Mara's POV. The environment constrains choice, as objects and the house's state charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve with the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is driven by Mara's agency in placing objects, leading to a deepening that reweights the stake of sanctification. Cost is felt in the house's transformation, and pressure coheres through the ritual. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as displacement and witness, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mara's realization. Subtext operates in gestures and implications, inviting reflection without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Mara's observant nature. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and diction remains consistent. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, enhancing momentum. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of sanctifying houses through displaced objects is fresh and specific, synthesized with emotional truth. Risk-taking in the quiet, introspective plot heightens stakes without gimmickry. The closure feels inevitable in hindsight, grounded in character and setting.</comment>
