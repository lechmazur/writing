<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply integrated with her motivation; her "astonished recluse" nature and "tranquilly perceptive" trait drive her decision to open the box, culminating in an earned change to keeper of unspoken words. Interiority is concrete and embodied, such as her understanding of ghosts from contextual clues. The final choice is compelled by prior causality, with visible cost in the ghosts' release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear causal lens: finding the box leads logically to reading the letter and the ghosts' dissipation. Closure is a decisive change with resonant reconfiguration, as Mara's new purpose emerges and the ghosts are released. Orientation is anchored early, and cost is legible in the on-page thinning of spirits. The drive lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory details, like the "copper sun" and "bleached white" hives, that pressure choices and charge the final image. The oasis and eucalyptus tree constrain Mara's actions, serving as a micro-setting that alters tactics. Specificity is purposeful, avoiding generic elements, and the environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing the ghosts from unspoken words—escalates under the causal lens through Mara's agency: she finds the box, chooses to open it, and reads the letter, forcing a trade-off with visible cost. The tightening narrows options and changes knowledge, driven by protagonist decisions rather than coincidence. Cost is unmistakable in the spirits' dissolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the ghosts' silent mouths and the stained glass box, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mara's new role, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, and the concept integrates seamlessly with character arc and closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent in Mara's POV, with a poetic yet controlled perceptual signature that reflects her tranquilly perceptive nature. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is purposeful, as with the ghosts' silent speeches, and pays off at closure. Rhythm and diction modulate with emotional intensity, enhancing pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously, as in the description of the stained glass box. Read-aloud ear test passes; syntax propels momentum, and closure is charged without ornamental padding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, synthesizing ghosts of unspoken words with a beekeeping oasis in a fresh, non-obvious way. Tropes are transformed through specific details, like the stained glass box and contextual clues, creating inevitability in hindsight. Risk-taking in quiet tone and lyric resonance heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure effect is fully integrated.</comment>
