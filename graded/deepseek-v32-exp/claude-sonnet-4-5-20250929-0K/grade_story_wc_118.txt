<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Miren's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her role as a historian preserving stories. Her sensitively perceptive trait is embodied in actions like tracing the tapestry and probing diaries, revealing character under pressure. The final choice to preserve Catherine's story is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her dedicated smile. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; interiority is concrete and particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Miren touches the tapestry, feeling Catherine's echo, reconfiguring meaning with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through density of connections. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality is tight, with the diary discovery leading logically to the tapestry connection. Cost is legible in the final image of her smile and continued work.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the silo library and objects like the tapestry constraining choices and charging the closure. Sensory details ("bronze quiet," dust motes) are selective and purposeful, filtered through Miren's POV. The tapestry as a micro-setting object actively shapes the narrative arc and final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, with clear transitions between levels.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving stories) is signaled early and escalates through Miren's agency in probing the diaries and connecting them to the tapestry. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation occurs via density increase and pattern break, reweighting stakes with emotional cost. The closure forecloses other paths, emphasizing her enduring commitment. No coincidence; turns arise from character action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and connection emerges organically through particulars like the tapestry and diary, without direct statement. Subtext operates in gestures and echoes, such as the tactile connection across centuries. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Miren's smile and the preserved stories. Avoids moralizing; complexity lingers in the cost of preservation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in Miren's poetic, sensitive voice. Diction and syntax reflect her character, e.g., "sensitively perceptive" and "bronze quiet." No head-hopping; psychic distance is consistent. Experimental tolerance is not needed; voice modulates purposefully with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and precise, with high information density and varied rhythm. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "industrial bones" and "whispers." No overwriting or register drift; clarity and momentum are maintained through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise is fresh, synthesizing post-displacement historiography with intimate object-based storytelling. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the silo library and burned diaries. Emotional truth avoids generic templates; risk-taking in quiet, accumulative narrative heightens stakes without gimmickry. The connection between tapestry and diary feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
