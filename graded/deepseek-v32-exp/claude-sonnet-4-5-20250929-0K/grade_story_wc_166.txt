<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Kaleth's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in elective exile and rebellion against the nostalgia ban. Her interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure, such as dancing to preserve memory. The final transformation is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her becoming a "living document." Contradictory impulses act in scene, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Kaleth's final pose embodies a truth, with cost legible in her being "spontaneously anchored" by what she's become. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, building through pattern and imagery. Orientation is clear early, and the moonstone discovery drives causality without breaks. Persistent constraint (nostalgia ban) shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the twilight garden and moonstone constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, e.g., "crystalline petals catching silver threads." The environment pressures Kaleth's dance and resonates with her transformation. Micro-setting (moonstone) is indispensable, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rebellion through embodied memory) escalates under the Accumulative lens via density increase in the dance sequence. Protagonist agency drives escalation, with the moonstone enabling permanence. Cost is unmistakable in Kaleth's transformation, foreclosing other paths. The tightening reweights options with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from events and images, such as dance as rebellion and exile as belonging, without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, e.g., embodying forbidden memories. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final pose. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and lingering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in Kaleth's observation of gaps. Voice is poetic and rhythmic, e.g., "obsidian grace," modulating with pressure. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off. Diction remains within character lexicon, enhancing immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with sentences advancing story, character, and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; metaphors are consistent and purposeful. Line-level propulsion is clear, e.g., "Her movements flowed like mercury." Read-aloud test passes with natural variation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of memory ban, embodied rebellion, and dance as scripture. Tropes are transformed through specific choices, like elective exile and moonstone integration. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise feels inevitable and fresh.</comment>
