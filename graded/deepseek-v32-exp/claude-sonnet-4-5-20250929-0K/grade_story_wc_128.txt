<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marianne's motivation evolves credibly from shrewdness to valuing recognition, with concrete interiority like "cautious exuberance." Her final shift is earned through prior causality, though internal contradiction is underdeveloped. The relationship with Chen acts as a crucible, forcing choices that alter her stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Marianne's perspective shifts, felt in "something shift in her chest," under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is tight from the envelope mistake to the project, with orientation clear early. Cost is legible in the reweighting of values.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the library under stars and harbor scent filtering through POV. Details like the glass dome charge the final image but do not strongly constrain choices. Spatial choreography is coherent, and tone supports theme without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of recognition escalates through Marianne's agency in documenting workers, under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is unmistakable in her shifted values and the project's impact. One meaningful tightening deepens the stake without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of cycles of compassion emerges organically from events like the locket and project, with subtext in gestures. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through stellar imagery, avoiding moralizing. Some neatness reduces complexity, but particulars anchor resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., Marianne's professional lens on "ledgers and manifests." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Rhythmic control under pressure, with no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "stars wheeled in their ancient patterns" is purposeful and clear. Sentences advance story efficiently, with clean grammar and syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of recognition tropes through specific details like cargo brokerage and lighthouse keeper. Feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk in the quiet, accumulative structure. However, it lacks transformative boldness for higher bands.</comment>
