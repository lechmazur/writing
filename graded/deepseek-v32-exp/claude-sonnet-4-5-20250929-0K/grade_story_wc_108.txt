<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maya's motivations are clear and rooted in her past betrayal and phobias, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final decision to expose the truth is earned by prior causality, showing credible endurance with visible cost. However, the phobias are mentioned but not deeply explored in on-page action during the climax, slightly limiting interior contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Maya exposes the truth, under a causal lens that holds throughout. The cost is legible in the fractured trust and her own past, shaping the final image. Orientation is clear early, and the twist with Reeves adds meaningful tightening without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The rusted library setting is vivid and sensory, pressuring Maya's claustrophobia and charging the final image with its "sighing" release. Details are selective and purposeful, integrated into action, though slightly more immersion in other senses could elevate it further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate meaningfully through Maya's agency in decoding and confronting Reeves, under the causal lens. The cost is unmistakable in the emotional trade-offs and foreclosed paths, with one key tightening that narrows options and deepens knowledge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability as power emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement, with subtext in gestures like pocketing the seashell. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final walk, though the last line edges toward explicit moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Maya's voice, and dialogue is natural and goal-driven. Rhythmic control under pressure is strong, with no head-hopping or elision issues, though minor register consistency could be sharper.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no major artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and legible, though a few phrases in peak beats lean slightly purple without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh specificity through character and stakes, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in themes and structure heightens coherence without gimmickry, though it doesn't reach the highest originality tier.</comment>
