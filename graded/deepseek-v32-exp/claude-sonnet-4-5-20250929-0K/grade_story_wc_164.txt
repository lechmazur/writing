<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; her interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices like frantically transliterating revealing character under stress. The final endurance of "cheerful gloom" is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in the realization that paths disappear to bear weight; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, reinforced by the albatross motif and persistent time constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The iridescent cave and crater glass constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory details are vivid and purposeful, with the environment directly enabling the climax and mirroring internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marina's agency in using vials on crater glass, narrowing options and revealing the core concept; cost is legible in the acceptance of unmade moments, deepening stakes under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the albatross seeds and unmade paths, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext in imagery charges the ending with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; poetic prose and rhythmic control under pressure enhance the Accumulative drive, and elision (e.g., time jumps) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats like the crater glass revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes memory and choice in a fresh, non-obvious way; risk-taking in conceptual approach heightens stakes, and the albatross motif transforms familiar tropes through specific detail.</comment>
