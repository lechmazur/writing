<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maris's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. The final choice to enter the whale's heart is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her potential absorption. However, interior contradiction is minimal, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Maris recovers memories and gravity stabilizes, with cost legible in her transformation. The hybrid drive lens holds, combining causal linkages with accumulative texture. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of gravity shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details filtered through Maris's POV. The salt crystal chamber and gravity fluctuations constrain choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve with events, supporting the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maris's agency under the hybrid lens, from investigating gravity to cutting into the whale's heart. Cost is unmistakable in her absorption into memories, foreclosing other paths. The dominant stake of finding deleted memories tightens meaningfully with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory and loss emerges organically through events and images, with subtext in patterns and crystals. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the crystallized moments. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic yet coherent, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping. Elision is taught and paid off in closure, enhancing the story's texture without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, even in peak beats. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere seamlessly, supporting the closure effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes magical realism and emotional depth with originality, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the concept of absences carrying weight heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity in details like the whale's heart and salt crystals anchors universals.</comment>
