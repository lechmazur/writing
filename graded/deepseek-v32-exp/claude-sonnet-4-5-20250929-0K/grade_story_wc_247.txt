<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's characterization is deeply embodied through concrete actions like using the empty camera, with interior conflict between feeling erased and seeking meaning. Her relationship with Theo serves as a crucible, forcing choices that alter her stance. The final renunciation of permanence for presence is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her emotional shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in Marina's realization of "presence, not permanence." The drive lens holds consistently, and the persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics. Orientation is clear early, and the ending reweights options without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The harbor setting is vividly integrated, constraining choices by supplying the patterns for the music and charging the final image with luminosity. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Marina's POV, avoiding cliché. The environment actively pressures the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marina's agency under the accumulative lens, as her mapping of silence leads to the disruptive music event. The cost is unmistakable in her "joyful sorrow" and the crowd's response. The dominant stake of being remembered tightens meaningfully through this turning point.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images like the empty camera and the translation of silence, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to erasure and meaning. Subtext operates in gestures and implications, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with Marina's perceptual signature evident in her visual framing of the world. Dialogue (signing) is natural and goal-driven, advancing plot. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure, with rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and lyrical rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, as in "light made sound," and propulsion aligns with emotional beats. No scaffold or register drift obscures closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The concept of translating silence into music is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity and authenticity avoid derivative templates.</comment>
