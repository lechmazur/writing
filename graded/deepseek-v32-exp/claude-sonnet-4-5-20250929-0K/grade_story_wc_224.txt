<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene (fear vs. acceptance), and the final choice to embed the stone is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("the pain was exquisite"). Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost ("pain was exquisite" and transformation). Accumulative/textural lens holds, orientation is clear early, and the stone's constraint shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (stone found in Philosophy wing) and charges the final image (bookstore rearranges). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV, with no generic placeholder elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency (choosing not to resist, pressing stone) under accumulative lens, with cost legible in pain and transformation. Dominant stake (understanding home) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (stone, feather) without moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("shape of home") that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in imagery and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure ("mercury-glass skin catching fragments"). POV is stable, voice is lyrical and coherent, with no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("refracted it into colors that had no names"), and syntax varies naturally with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Specific synthesis (mercury-glass seer, magical bookstore) feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices.</comment>
