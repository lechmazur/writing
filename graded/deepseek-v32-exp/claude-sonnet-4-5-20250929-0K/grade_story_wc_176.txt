<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion (e.g., weeping). Her forgiveness and subsequent work are earned, and micro-choices under pressure (reconfiguring the rope) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final choice to create bells is credible and forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the accumulative/textural lens, closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in Mira's tears and the bells' creation. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The rope and punched card act as persistent constraints shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum and aurora are vivid and purposeful, constraining choices (e.g., the sanctum's isolation focuses the ritual) and charging the final image of the bells. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Mira's POV, with the environment mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving forgotten names) escalates under the accumulative lens through Mira's agency—reconfiguring the rope, humming names—leading to illumination and casting. Cost is unmistakable in her weeping and the permanent preservation, narrowing options and reweighting stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and loss emerges organically through concrete actions and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the bells ringing, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the "technically gentle" touch.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, modulating with emotional intensity (e.g., "snowmelt ardor"). Purposeful compression (e.g., the transcribed memory concept) is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language ("aurora's green fire") is coherent and supports pressure. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, and the final image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of lost wax casting, transcribed memory, and icebound setting feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific choices. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure reconfigures meaning with emotional specificity.</comment>
