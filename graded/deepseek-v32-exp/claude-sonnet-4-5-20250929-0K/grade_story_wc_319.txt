<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong motivation and embodied emotion, with micro-choices under pressure; however, contradictory impulses (feral instinct vs. aching intelligence) are not simultaneously active in scene, reducing depth slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Clear causal drive with orientation established early; closure lands decisively with felt cost (risk of dissolution) and lens holds; pendant's destruction resolves stakes coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (e.g., "mist so thick it felt like breathing wool") that constrain choice and charge the final image (garden shatters); setting is integral to tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency (decision to destroy pendant) under causal lens; cost is legible on-page (dimensional fracturing risks) and stakes tighten meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges through events and character arc; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer (smile while waiting for night) without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control in prose; POV is stable and voice remains consistent under pressure, with no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High information density with lyrical yet clear prose; no loops or scaffold, and figurative language (e.g., "dimensional longing") enhances clarity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tropes (feral guardian, dream realm) with specific details; risk-taking in conceptual premise pays off with inevitable feel and heightened stakes.</comment>
