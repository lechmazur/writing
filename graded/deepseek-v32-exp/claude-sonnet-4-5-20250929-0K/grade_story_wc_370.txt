<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Iris's characterization is deeply rooted in contradictory impulses—her empathy forces withdrawal, shown in embodied micro-choices like smoothing the invitation. Her final realization that "staying while leaving wasn't the same thing" is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in her admission of hurting her sister. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains concrete and particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hybrid drive lens (causal-accumulative) holds strong; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Iris reads herself "back into the world," reconfiguring her stance on presence with felt cost. Orientation is clear by ~120 words; the library's paradoxical nature shapes tactics and final image without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the finale—the Paradox Library's impossible dimensions force Iris's confrontation, and the "door marked Storage" reweights meaning. Sensory details (fluorescent hum, soft light) are selective and POV-filtered; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict between distance and connection) escalates under hybrid lens via Iris's agency—pushing the door, confessing to the woman—narrowing options. Cost is legible in her whispered admission and the final paradox of "staying by choosing when to go."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of empathy and presence emerges through particulars like the crumpled invitation and library paradox, not statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the book's stories and the woman's wisdom, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—Iris's noticing is biased (e.g., "waiting without waiting"). Dialogue with the elderly woman carries subtext and goal pursuit. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., library entrance) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("nestled paradoxes made architectural") coheres and supports pressure. Sentence propulsion varies naturally, especially in closure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes (secret society, recluse) into a fresh, non-obvious angle through specific lived detail and moral calculus. Risk-taking in paradoxical architecture heightens stakes without gimmickry; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
