<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to understand her grandmother's past is clear and rooted in familial severance, with interiority shown through embodied shifts like "something shift inside her." Her final realization is earned through the scene's causality, and Takeo applies secondary pressure. Minor abstraction in emotional description prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost legible in the final image of "the careful, patient work of tending living things." Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the single-scene structure tightens meaningfully without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposeful, with the islet, pine, and ocean constraining choices and charging the closure. The compass and lace function as micro-settings that directly influence Mira's actions and the thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake in understanding familial silence escalates through Mira's agency in decoding the lace pattern, narrowing options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in the acceptance of unspoken apologies, though escalation is more deepening than tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the lace pattern, compass, and bonsai metaphor, offering a non-literal answer on healing from silence. Subtext in gestures and images avoids moralizing, with the final image reweighting prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice; dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, but minor convergence in Takeo's and Mira's internal voices at closure limits a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "each word arriving like a wave" is purposeful and clear, supporting momentum to the closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of bonsai, lace instructions, and ghost ship feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in quiet resolution. Specificity in elements like the compass pointing to loss avoids template plots, but some familiarity in the mentor-student dynamic slightly limits innovation.</comment>
