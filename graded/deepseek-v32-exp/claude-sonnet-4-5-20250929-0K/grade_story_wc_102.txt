<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei's motivation is clear and rooted in her past-life memory, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. Her final realization and release of the jade tear are earned through prior causality, showing a decisive change with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as panic and love during the breathing exercise, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as Mei's understanding of transformed love reweights the premise with felt cost ("the old grief... began to unknot"). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the persistent constraint of unused love shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The twilight viaduct and wisteria bloom are vivid and purposeful, constraining choices through the camera obscura's inversion and charging the final image with transformed love. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Mei's POV, avoiding cliché and integrating into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mei's agency under the Accumulative lens, as her interaction with the pilgrim deepens her understanding, leading to a cost-legible unknotting of grief. The dominant stake of finding unused love is signaled early and tightens through a meaningful cadence shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material through the realization that beauty stores unuttered love, avoiding abstraction and earning wisdom through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and first-person with a distinct perceptual signature, using lyrical prose that modulates with emotional intensity. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with no head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in the closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity and propulsion in peak beats, such as "golden threads spiraling from her chest."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of camera obscura artistry and mystical elements feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is transformed through specific details like the pilgrim of sparks and Kwan Yin's tear, avoiding derivative patterns.</comment>
