<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cosima's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as repairing the music box and sharing the jars. Her final act of giving the music box to Mrs. Chen is earned by prior causality, demonstrating a credible endurance with visible cost. No stock phrasing or diagnostic label-speak; flaws like vagrancy and obsession compound naturally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early with who, where, and when anchored. Under the accumulative/textural lens, closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Cosima gives the music box to Mrs. Chen, reweighting her purpose with felt cost in the final image. Causality is tight, with the music box repair and jar capture leading decisively to the sharing scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like salt and wild roses filtering through Cosima's POV. The feral loft and glass jars constrain choices and charge the final image, as the jars' glow and the music box's return shape tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve with the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake in preserving dying songs escalates through Cosima's agency under the accumulative lens, from capturing sounds to sharing the music box's lullaby. Cost is legible in Mrs. Chen's weeping and Cosima's renewed purpose, narrowing options and deepening emotional weight. No coincidence; resolution is earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of gleaned redemption emerges through concrete events and images, such as the music box repair and jar sharing, without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like Cosima pressing the music box into Mrs. Chen's hands, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to bridging generations. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, reflected in perceptual signatures like seeing "past the corrosion" in the music box. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present (e.g., Mrs. Chen's line). Rhythm and diction control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffolds.

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise of sound preservation in jars is fresh and well-integrated, transforming the vagrant poet trope through specific details like the music box repair.
