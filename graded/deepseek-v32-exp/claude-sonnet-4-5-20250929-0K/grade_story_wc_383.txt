<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, with interiority shown through concrete actions like tending the garden. Her final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her refusal to share the research. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her desire for recognition versus preservation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in her refusal and peace. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through descriptive density. Orientation is clear early, and the garden's constraint shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The velvet garden constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "moonflowers pulsed with stored light" woven into action. Setting pressures tactics and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens is driven by Mira's agency, with the dawn deadline tightening stakes. Cost is legible in her refusal, foreclosing legitimacy for isolation. One meaningful deepening reweights the dominant stake of preservation versus sharing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images like the seashell and garden, offering a resonant answer to memory and loss without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, such as "tragically radiant blooms" reflecting beauty and cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical prose like "ghostly resolve." Rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping. Elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent, e.g., "flowers turning toward her like an audience," and peak beats avoid muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of quarantined memories with garden imagery, feeling inevitable. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the concept is fully committed.</comment>
