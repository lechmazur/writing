<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her history of witnessing collapse. Her altruism drives key choices, such as chalking messages, and her interaction with Kessa reveals layered purpose. However, internal contradiction is underdeveloped; her resolve lacks visible friction or cost beyond stated intent. The final endurance feels earned but could benefit from deeper embodied struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with Mara's smile and planning, reconfiguring her isolation into shared purpose. Causal lens holds tightly: messages directly trigger colony cooperation. Orientation is immediate, anchoring who, where, and when within the first paragraph. Cost is legible in the community's fragile recovery and Mara's ongoing commitment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—perpetual twilight, floating arches, blighted orchards—and actively pressures choices by framing the survival stakes. Sensory details (e.g., "gnarled fruit trees," "serpentine shadows") are selective and POV-filtered. The butterfly garden and arches recur to charge the final image, though the nebula remains more decorative than constraining.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (colony survival) escalates through Mara's agency under the causal lens, as each message narrows options and forces trades. The cost of forgotten unity is felt in the colonists' initial hoarding and gradual trust. One meaningful tightening occurs when Joren's reexamination speech catalyzes collective action, foreclosing fragmentation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—chalk messages, shared labor—culminating in Mara's non-literal insight that "respite isn't a place. It's what we build together." Subtext operates through imagery (e.g., budding orchards, new stars) without moralizing. The ending reweights prior struggles with resonant ambiguity about community and endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mara, with a distinct lyrical voice reflective of her ghostly perspective. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (e.g., Kessa's curiosity advancing theme). Perceptual signature is strong, filtering setting through her purpose. No head-hopping or register drift, though minor characters lack voice distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmically varied, with high information density (e.g., "The chalk felt strange in her ectoplasmic fingers—simultaneously there and not there"). No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle; sentences propel momentum. Read-aloud test passes smoothly, and closure image is sharpened by precise diction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes ghostly mediator, ecological crisis, and chalk-message mechanics into a fresh, non-obvious whole. Tropes (altruistic ghost, fractured colony) are transformed through specific world-building and Mara's grounded agency. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative escalation pays off with inevitable hindsight.</comment>
