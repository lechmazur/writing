<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mirelle's characterization is deeply rooted in consistent traits—her disguised wisdom, observational skills, and calculated performance under pressure. Internal conflict is shown through her hidden intelligence versus her eccentric facade, with micro-choices like speeding up embroidery revealing her values. Emotions are embodied, such as trembling hands that might be genuine or performance, avoiding stock phrasing. The final choice to complete the chart and seek understanding is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the imminent coup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal drive with tight because/therefore linkages, from flame disruptions to decoded messages and urgent action. Orientation is clear early, anchoring who, where, and when. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mirelle completes her embroidery and whispers a prayer, reconfiguring options with undeniable pressure as the coup looms. Cost is legible in the whispered prayer and echoing boots, with the persistent constraint of the flame shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the cobalt observatory and tarnished copper dome creating a atmospheric pressure cooker. The eternal candle flame constrains choices by serving as a carrier signal and charges the final image with its brightening. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like the silver thread catching candlelight, filtered through Mirelle's POV. Spatial choreography is coherent, from workstation to courtyard, guiding action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preventing the coup and protecting knowledge—escalates through Mirelle's agency under the causal lens, as she decodes the flame and acts. Pressure tightens with the flame's dimming and approaching footsteps, forcing a decisive choice to complete the embroidery. Cost is unmistakable in the risk she takes, foreclosing options with the whispered prayer. One meaningful tightening narrows options and changes knowledge, driven by protagonist action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events—wisdom disguised as foolishness, listening to silence—without direct statement. Subtext operates in gestures like Mirelle's thin smile and the embroidery's hidden meanings. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the whispered prayer, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through the charged poise of unresolved tension.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in Mirelle's observational, poetic voice. Diction and syntax reflect her mindset, modulating under pressure without head-hopping. Dialogue, though sparse, is natural and goal-driven, as in Commander Vas's smirk and muttered "Madness." Purposeful elision in decoded messages is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with varied sentence structures accelerating tension. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; metaphors like "history prepared to bend" are coherent and purposeful. Clarity and momentum are maintained, with every sentence advancing story or atmosphere. Line-level craft supports propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of embroidery as code and the flame as signal, transforming tropes through specific, grounded choices. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth and human complexity avoid templates, anchored in Mirelle's unique perspective. Ingenuity is evident in the non-obvious integration of elements like adjacent possibilities.</comment>
