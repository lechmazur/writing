<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her grandfather's legacy, with interiority shown through concrete actions like carrying the key tag. Her final choice to transcribe the dictionary is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her renewed understanding of her work. However, minor lack of contradictory impulses in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Plot follows an accumulative lens with coherent causality, leading to a conceptual repricing at closure where Mara reinterprets her role as translation. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. Cost is legible in the final image of lanterns as musical notes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and constrains choices, such as the sunken ship library enabling discovery. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, charging the final image. The pier and lanterns integrate seamlessly with character perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early in Mara's quest, escalating through her agency in diving and discovering the bottles. Under the accumulative lens, density increases with cost legible in her realization. Minor deduction for reliance on preparation rather than active mid-scene conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of sensory translation emerges organically through images and events, with subtext in the grandfather's project. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the symphony of light metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature that reflects Mara's introspection. Prose rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping. No dialogue present, so not evaluated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes synesthesia, maritime lore, and memory in a fresh, non-obvious way. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The combination feels inevitable in hindsight, with strong conceptual integrity.</comment>
