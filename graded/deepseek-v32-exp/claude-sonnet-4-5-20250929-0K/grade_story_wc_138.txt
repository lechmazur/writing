<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cassius's boredom and Naia's resentment are concretely embodied, with micro-choices under pressure driving the relationship crucible. The final choice to let Naia go is earned by prior causality, though Cassius's sudden urgency feels slightly abrupt but justified. Interiority avoids stock phrasing, and emotions are layered with contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change as Cassius understands his loss and plots to tear dimensions apart, with cost legible in the empty escondite. Causal lens holds strong from fragment arrival to storm peak, with orientation clear early. No outline-like sequencing or teleporting props.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite and magnetic fields constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory detail purposeful and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the setting evolves with the storm, though some descriptions border density without harming momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under causal lens, with stakes tightening as Naia's plan unfolds during the storm. Cost is felt in Cassius's loss, and the dominant stake (Naia's desire for death vs. Cassius's boredom) is tested meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of immortality and loss emerge through particulars like the fragment and Naia's farewell, with subtext in dialogue ("Maybe some goodbyes are meant to be final"). Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—Cassius's dimensional awareness colors narration. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with voice consistency under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language purposeful and no loops or scaffold. Sentences advance story and atmosphere seamlessly, and read-aloud test passes with clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of immortal boredom and dimensional mutiny feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific choices like Naia's grey existence. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure is fully integrated.</comment>
