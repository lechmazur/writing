<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation for belonging is clear and intensifies under pressure, with concrete interiority and micro-choices like launching drones without command. However, contradictory impulses are not fully dramatized in scene, and the "perpetually surprised" trait leans slightly ornamental, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mara commits to the mission, reconfiguring her isolation with felt cost. Causal lens holds tightly from pilgrim's arrival to drone deployment, and orientation is anchored early without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purpose-driven, with the observatory's cracked dome and "brilliant dimness" constraining choices by enabling star trail navigation. Sensory details are filtered through Mara's POV, and the chip as micro-setting charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes for belonging escalate through Mara's agency under the causal lens, from receiving the chip to launching drones. Cost is legible in her isolation, but the escalation lacks one tightening that forecloses a live option, holding it just below the highest band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges through concrete images like star trails and chips without moralizing, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Mara's mission. Subtext in "frequency of belonging" deepens the narrative without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic rhythm ("brilliant dimness"), and dialogue advances plot naturally. Minor elision in drone mechanics is taught and paid off, but perceptual signature could be sharper under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "cosmic strings" is coherent and purposeful, and closure image is undulled by scaffolding or redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes star trails and belonging with originality, transforming tropes through specific details like the matrix chip. Risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
