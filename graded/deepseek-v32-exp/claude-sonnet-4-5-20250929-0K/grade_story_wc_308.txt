<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in tradition; his interiority is concrete through embodied actions like feeling the pulse. The final choice to fix the tower is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in weeks of work, though lacking internal conflict limits higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early; closure is an Earned Stasis with cost legible in "weeks of careful work." The accumulative/textural lens holds, with the fracture in the tower shaping tactics persistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the bone towers and canyon constraining Kael's choice to realign the fracture. The arrowhead as micro-setting charges the final image, integral to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring navigation) escalates under accumulative lens through Kael's agency in appraising the arrowhead and syncing with ravens. Cost is unmistakable in the work required, foreclosing other paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory and navigation without moving emerges through particulars like the arrowhead's pulse and ravens' patterns. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and reflective, controlled under pressure. No head-hopping or elision issues; prose rhythm supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats like the synchronization with ravens, ensuring propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Concept of harmonic stone skimming is fresh and specific, synthesizing memory and navigation. Risk-taking in quiet, meditative plot heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
