<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion like trembling hands and tears. Her criminal actions align with her goal to preserve forbidden loves, and the final choice to face judgment is earned by prior causality. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her analytical mind versus intuitive heart, with visible cost in her ruined reputation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Mara's realization reweights the premise of love transcending boundaries, with felt cost in her emotional release and readiness for judgment. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through artifact accumulation to the tapestry connection. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight from thefts to revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the limestone cave archive constraining choice and charging the final image through sensory details like ochre pigments and tactile tapestry handling. Micro-setting elements like the frescoes and tapestry fragment are integrated into action, shaping Mara's discovery and emotional arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake in preserving forbidden loves escalates under the accumulative lens through Mara's agency in stealing and documenting artifacts, leading to a tightening choice to reveal the truth. Cost is legible in her criminal status and emotional toll, with the final image reweighting options through the tapestry connection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from events and images, such as the tapestry and vandalized portrait, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the continuity of love, reweighting prior material with complexity and emotional honesty, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature blending analytical and intuitive tones. Prose reflects Mara's character under pressure, with rhythmic control and no head-hopping. Purposeful elision in backstory is anchored in present cues like Kenji's grandmother's grip.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops or scaffold issues; figurative language like "volcanic tenderness" is coherent and enhances peak beats. Sentence-level rhythm supports emotional intensity without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of art preservation and forbidden love feels inevitable, with specific details like the vandalized portrait transforming tropes.
