<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sarah's internal conflict between protocol and compassion is embodied in micro-choices, such as wetting her fingertips to play the disc, with the final decision to invite wrong numbers earned by prior causality. The elderly caller's persistence creates a credible crucible, and Sarah's shift from cultivated estrangement to hopeful connection carries visible cost in her defiance of Department rules.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Sarah reinterprets "wrong number" as an invitation, under a causal lens where the man's callback triggers her rebellion. Orientation is immediate, and the cost of violating cultivated estrangement is felt in the final image of the disc singing differently, reconfiguring her stance without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The underground utility tunnel constrains choice through its isolation and mechanical breathing, while the glass harmonica disc charges the final image by shifting from haunted to hopeful. Sensory details like condensation on pipes and the hum of streetlamps are filtered through Sarah's POV, enhancing atmosphere without slowing momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Sarah's agency under the causal lens, as she breaks protocol to play the disc and advise the caller, narrowing her options with legible cost.

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the juxtaposition of cultivated estrangement and the glass harmonica's resonance, with the ending offering a non-literal answer that reweights wrong numbers as potential beginnings.

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and limited to Sarah, with a distinct perceptual signature in her professional observations of the tunnel's mechanics. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit, as seen in the man's request to hear the disc, and prose rhythm modulates with emotional pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts; sentences like "The sound that emerged was neither note nor noise but something between" advance character and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
