<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Meris's motivation is clear and rooted in her identity as a cloud-shadow poet, with interiority shown through embodied actions like the "tremor of certainty." Her micro-choices under pressure, such as composing with intention, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final choice to compose is earned by prior causality, though contradictory impulses are not deeply explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (poetry breathing again) with conceptual cost legible in "they can't un-dissolve the boundaries." The accumulative/textural lens holds, with patterns of meaning and beauty intensifying. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium and frozen lake are vivid and selective, constraining choices (e.g., the colonnade enables poetry) and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, with the environment mirroring internal states like the "cracked like ancient porcelain" lake.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is the revival of fluid meaning against control, escalating through Meris's agency in composing and Kael's warning. Under the accumulative lens, density increases with the colonnade's response. Cost is visible in the risk of future bans, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of meaning versus beauty emerges coherently from events and images, with subtext in dialogue (e.g., "paraphrase would kill it"). The ending offers a non-literal answer through the image of poetry breathing, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, consistent perceptual signature, and controlled psychic distance. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts harming clarity. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, though slightly elevated in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core premise of cloud-shadow poetry and quartz colonnade is fresh and non-obvious, synthesized with specific details. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation feels inevitable in hindsight, with originality in the concept of quantum meaning.</comment>
