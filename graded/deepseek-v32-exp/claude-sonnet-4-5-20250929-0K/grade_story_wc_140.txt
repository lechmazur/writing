<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her erasure, with interiority shown through concrete perceptions like seeing patterns in rust. Her final decision to reclaim her life is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her return to the labyrinth. However, her initial passivity slightly limits agency, but micro-choices under pressure, such as collecting fragments, reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration where the poison label revelation reweights meaning with conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored early, and the harbormaster's entry ties fragments together cohesively. A minor coincidence in the revelation is mitigated by the patterned buildup, but the lens remains stable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image; the container maze pressures Maya's movements and symbolizes erasure. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV, with the labyrinth actively shaping the narrative arc and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes center on existential erasure, escalating through accumulative density of fragments and stories, driven by Maya's agency in collecting and listening. Cost is legible in her decision to fix paperwork while acknowledging return, foreclosing a path with felt trade-offs under the textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of erasure and memory emerges organically through particulars like the poison label and roses, with subtext in gestures and implications. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal reweighting without moralizing, as the final lines reprioritize preservation and loss with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that filters reality through Maya's bias, evident in lines like "seeing patterns in rust streaks." Rhythmic control under pressure is maintained, and any elision in fragment collection is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with purposeful figurative language, though minor overwriting occurs in peak beats (e.g., "filtered reality differently"). No loops or scaffold obscure causality; propulsion is clear, and closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is freshly synthesized, transforming bureaucratic error into a meditation on erasure through specific details like the container maze and poison label. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes, and the ending feels inevitable with non-obvious resonance, avoiding derivative patterns.</comment>
