<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion (e.g., laughing from absurdity, trembling fingers). His prophetic nature and micro-choices under pressure earn the final endurance, with visible cost in his isolation. However, minor lack of deeper internal conflict in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as the green dawn reweights meaning, with felt cost in Kael's continued isolation. The accumulative/textural lens holds strong, and orientation is clear early. The prophetic constraint shapes tactics, but slight ambiguity in time-bending mechanics slightly limits impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated, with the lighthouse and storm constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details (e.g., green glass, howling wind) are selective and POV-filtered, enhancing atmosphere. The glass wick as micro-setting actively shapes the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shaping dawn) escalates through Kael's agency in steering the light, under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the green dawn's hope and his isolation. One meaningful tightening occurs with the light bending time, though stakes remain slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of light/darkness and meaning emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in the lighthouse's function. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the green dawn, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Minor reliance on poetic abstraction limits depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and rhythmically controlled, modulating with pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., prophetic curses) is taught and paid off. Dialogue is absent, so not evaluated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with clear propulsion and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is voice-motivated and coherent, though slight overwriting in descriptive peaks (e.g., "component meanings") causes minor drag without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, synthesizing storm herald lore with temporal uncertainty in a post-information age. Specific choices (e.g., prophetic laughter) transform tropes, and risk-taking in style heightens stakes. The closure feels inevitable and fresh.</comment>
