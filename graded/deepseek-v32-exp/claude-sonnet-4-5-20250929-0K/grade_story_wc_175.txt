<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her esoteric realist identity, with embodied emotion shown through the "knot in her chest." Her final endurance and decision to continue building are earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the eased knot. However, internal contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost legible in "the knot in her chest eased slightly." Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the transient grotto and structures shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the grotto and bamboo tower constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as "blushing stillness," and the environment actively pressures Mira's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (honoring forgotten migrations) and escalate through the monarchs' arrival, deepening emotional weight under the Accumulative lens. Mira's agency in building and realizations drives the tightening, with cost felt in the temporary nature of her structures.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events, like the moth wing and temporary structures, with subtext in implication. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting impermanence and memory through the final butterfly image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature reflecting Mira's mindset. Voice controls rhythm and diction under pressure, such as "interrupted cadence," and elision is taught and paid off without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, e.g., "blushing stillness," and sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing temporary art with ecological mourning in a non-obvious way. Details like the esoteric realist and moth wing are irreplaceable, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
