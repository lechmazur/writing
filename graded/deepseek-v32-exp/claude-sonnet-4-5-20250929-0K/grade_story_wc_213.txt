<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied through calloused hands and seven years of vigil, with motivation rooted in listening over noise. Her decision to override the system arises from credibly curious investigation, showing internal conflict between tradition and technology. The final choice to ring the bell is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the storm's damage and defiance of the board.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost: the sanctuary damaged but valley saved, under a causal lens where Mara's actions drive the plot. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the rope's vibration triggers a because/therefore sequence leading to the warning. No causality breaks; the ending reconfigures stakes with the rope settling into stillness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—"windblown sanctuary above the clouds"—and constrains choice by making the rope an instrument due to atmospheric collisions. Sensory details like the rope's texture and solstice hush are filtered through Mara's POV, charging the final image. The environment pressures tactics and integrates seamlessly with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of warning the valley escalates under causal lens: rope vibration leads to overriding the system and ringing the bell, driven by Mara's agency. Cost is legible in the cracked buttresses and her endured defiance. One meaningful tightening forecloses options with visible price, avoiding coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of listening versus noise emerges through particulars like the rope's vibrations and Mara's resistance to false alarms, without moralizing. Subtext operates in her manual override and the final image of the rope waiting, offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Earned through concrete struggle and character complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—Mara's professional attention to microclimates and rope vibrations. Voice is consistent and poetic, yet grounded in her experience; no head-hopping or register drift. Elision in backstory is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically varied and dense, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "bleached white by perpetual sunlight" is purposeful and clear. No scaffolding or repetitive stems; closure image is sharp and unobscured.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise synthesizes ancient technology with modern conflict, transformed through specific details like the rope as instrument. Risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight, with emotional specificity avoiding tropes.</comment>
