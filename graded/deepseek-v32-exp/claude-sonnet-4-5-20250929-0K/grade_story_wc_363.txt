<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mariko's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying to compel her sacrificial choice. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion under pressure. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a decisive change with felt cost under an accumulative/textural lens. The plot coheres with because/therefore linkages, and orientation is clear early. The latent sacrifice reconfigures meaning without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details filtered through POV. The orchard and loom constrain choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve with the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving Kenji) escalates through protagonist agency under the accumulative lens. The cost is legible in Mariko's sacrifice, narrowing options and foreclosing paths. Pressure tightens meaningfully without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in gesture and implication. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to sacrifice and love, without moralizing. Complexity is embraced through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature. Voice is lyrical and consistent, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; prose reflects Mariko's mind state under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with varied rhythm and high information density. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive, and closure is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and well-integrated, synthesizing weaving and liminal spaces through specific details. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
