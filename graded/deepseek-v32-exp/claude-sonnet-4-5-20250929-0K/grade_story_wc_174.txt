<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His motivation intensifies compellingly, from rebellion against his calligrapher past to the earned reversal in ethical storytelling. The final choice is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his raw self-questioning and dawn realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—Marcus's completed reversal—under a causal lens, felt cost in the expectant silence and foreclosed path. Orientation is clear early, and the dome's history as a persistent constraint shapes tactics. The lens holds without ambiguity, and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The radar dome setting constrains choice and charges the final image with symbolic resonance, its serene silence mirroring internal change. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Marcus's POV. The story stick as micro-setting evolves in use, deepening atmosphere without ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marcus's agency under the causal lens, through puppet experimentation leading to reversal, with cost legible in hours of work and dawn insight. Dominant stake in ethical storytelling tightens meaningfully, though external conflict is minimal, limiting peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, resisting moralizing in favor of complexity. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through "an honest question," reweighting prior material without statement. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in Marcus's reflective voice. Prose rhythm and diction are controlled under pressure, and purposeful compression (e.g., backstory interleaving) serves closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in phrases like "half-lit epiphanies" slightly muddles peak beats, but clarity and propulsion remain strong, with no artifacts harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of puppetry and ethical inquiry, transformed through specific character detail. Risk-taking in quiet, internal arc heightens stakes without gimmickry, though it leans on familiar artist-crisis tropes, limiting ingenuity.</comment>
