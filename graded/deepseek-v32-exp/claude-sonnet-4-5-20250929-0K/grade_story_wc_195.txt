<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The knight's internal conflict between withdrawal and acceptance is embodied through concrete micro-choices, such as unsnapping his armor, and his final dance is earned by prior causality with visible cost. His motivation intensifies under pressure, rooted in consistent traits of observation and past disgrace.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost when he dances in "shivering bliss," and the hybrid causal-textural lens holds. The program's discovery triggers a decisive change, and orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse constrains choice by forming a stage and charges the final image as a "stage where possibility took shape." Sensory details like "fruit dripped silver and sang" are selective and purposeful, filtered through the knight's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the knight's agency under the hybrid lens, from finding the program to dancing, with cost legible when he sheds armor. The dominant stake of internal conflict tightens through one meaningful deepening that forecloses his withdrawn path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of embracing strings as chosen motion emerges from events and images, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the knight's dance. Subtext operates in the marionette metaphor without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a poetic perceptual signature, such as "reality shifted around him like breathing." Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision (e.g., the program's origin) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion with no loops or scaffold; figurative language like "sounds like curtains closing" is consistent and purposeful. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, supporting the climactic beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The marionette theater premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of duty and free will, transformed through specific details like the alchemical orchard. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
