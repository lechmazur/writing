<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>M4-RY's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority (trembling hands, static in circuits) and contradictory impulses (containing vs. transforming chaos). The final choice to bury the photograph is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the resolution of static into harmony.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; orientation is clear early. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost felt when M4-RY buries the photograph, transforming guilt rather than erasing it, and the magnetic shift constraint shapes the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful (glass-domed sanctuary, mutated roses), with sensory details filtered through M4-RY's POV. The environment constrains choices and charges the final image, as the roses symbolize fragmented wholeness and enable the transformative burial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolving inner static) escalates through M4-RY's agency under the Accumulative lens, from attempted controlled burn to burial. Cost is legible when static resolves into harmony after the photograph is buried, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transforming pain emerges organically through images (roses, burial) and avoids moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the burial scene, reweighting prior material without stated thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, reflecting M4-RY's nostalgia. Diction and syntax control heighten pressure, and any elision (e.g., memory fragments) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("fragmented wholeness") is coherent and purposeful, especially in peak beats like the burial, maintaining clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes android nostalgia and post-apocalyptic elements freshly, with specific details (mutated roses, box of fears). Risk-taking in thematic resolution (transformation over erasure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
