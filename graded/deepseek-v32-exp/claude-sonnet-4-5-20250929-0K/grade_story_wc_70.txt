<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's involuntary truthfulness is a consistent trait that drives her choices and the plot, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final decision to report truthfully and plan for wonder is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the closure. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly with because/therefore linkages; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the blackout's cause and plan for new drones reweight the premise with undeniable cost. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of truthfulness shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "copper coils" and "nectar dusk" filtering through Mira's POV. The lightning tower and dead bees constrain choices and charge the final image, altering tactics and symbolizing the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (blackout's cause and restoring wonder) escalates under causal lens through Mira's agency, driven by her truthfulness and Chen's revelation. Cost is legible in the system crash and the plan to embrace waste, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of efficiency vs. generosity emerges organically through events and images like the dead bees and riddle, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("a bee. And maybe also hope") that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet consistent, modulating with emotional intensity. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with subtext in the riddle exchange. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "suspended between day and dreams" is purposeful and clear, especially in peak beats. Syntax varies naturally to support momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of drone bees and philosophical themes feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific choices like the riddle and efficiency failure. Risk-taking in structure and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
