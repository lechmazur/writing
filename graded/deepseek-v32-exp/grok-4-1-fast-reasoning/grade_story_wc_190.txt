<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with embodied emotion. His fluidly logical actions and the children's transformation show micro-choices under pressure, but the lack of deep internal contradiction limits the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as silence "learns" to comfort, with cost legible in Mira's tears. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early, with the storm glass vial as a persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prism terrace and gondola are vividly described with sensory detail, constraining choices and charging the final image. The setting integrates into action, reflecting internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the Accumulative lens, from noise disruption to catalytic silence, with cost felt in the emotional shift. The dominant stake of emotional comfort tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the storm glass and silence motifs, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to chaos versus peace. Subtext operates in gestures and images without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and third-person limited, with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, and elision (e.g., "vaulting hush") is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied syntax, though minor repetition of "vaulting hush" and "fluidly logical" slightly dulls momentum. No major artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of teaching silence through a storm glass is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
