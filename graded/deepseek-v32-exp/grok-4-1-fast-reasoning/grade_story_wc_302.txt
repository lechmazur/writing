<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions like "cautious thrill." However, internal conflict lacks deep contradiction; choices are linear rather than simultaneously contradictory impulses. Final transformation is earned through causality, but not fully complex.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as she emerges transformed, ready for the next letter; accumulative lens holds with pattern of deciphering. Orientation is clear early, and watch constraints shape tactics. Minor simplicity in plot structure limits higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "mists curling like tentative fingers," constraining choices through propagation delays. Library acts as micro-setting that charges the final image of documentation, integrating atmosphere with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stake of finding the library is signaled early; escalation driven by agency in deciphering watch, narrowing options. Cost is legible in transformation, but conflict is more internal with minimal external pressure, under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken truths emerges through events and images like the library of floating script, offering resonant non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing, but subtext could be deeper; integration is coherent but not exceptionally layered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct poetic voice, e.g., "veil fluttering like whispered secrets." Perceptual signature is strong, and elision in deciphering is taught and paid off. No head-hopping, but voice occasionally ornate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is vivid with varied rhythm, but dense figurative language in peaks risks overwriting, e.g., "exhilaration surged." No major loops or scaffold, though some synonym churn like "cautious exuberance" repeated. Clarity maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of library and cipher watch feels inevitable, with specific details transforming tropes. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure recharges prior material.</comment>
