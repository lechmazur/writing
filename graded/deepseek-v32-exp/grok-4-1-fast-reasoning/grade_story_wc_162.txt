<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to find her father and understand sacred thresholds. Her featherly determination is embodied in micro-choices like tracing grain and using the logbook, with the final cross earning closure through prior causality. Minor abstraction in emotional expression prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive holds tightly with Elowen's actions leading to reunion; closure lands with cost in "lose the light" sacrifice. Orientation is clear early, and the lens remains coherent without ambiguity, supporting a decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace and wood grain constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like "fractured light" woven into action. Setting actively shapes tactics and resolution, achieving high specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elowen's agency in decoding patterns and realigning prisms, with cost legible in the threshold sacrifice. Pressure tightens meaningfully under the causal lens, though the climax lacks a deeper trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of necessary distances emerges organically from events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in thresholds and gaps enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively poetic, with controlled diction like "featherly determined" reflecting Elowen's perception. No head-hopping; elision in intuition is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with figurative language serving momentum without muddle. Minor template cadence in descriptive sequences prevents a higher score, but clarity and propulsion remain strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes maze architecture and aviation post-butterfly effect with fresh specificity. Risks in lyrical compression heighten stakes, and closure feels inevitable from established patterns.</comment>
