<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies, rooted in the protagonist's erased history. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotions, such as the "bitter almonds on tongue" during the revelation. The final choice to reclaim their history is earned by prior layering of fragments, with visible cost in the survival narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the poison label discovery, un-erasing the protagonist's history under the accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity. Cost is legible in the "frantic survival, nameless flight" image, charging the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, with tides dictating movement and containers forming a "cathedral of rust." Sensory details like "salt-laced wind" and "creak of metal" are purposeful and POV-filtered. The environment charges the final image by exposing the poison label, essential to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early as discovering memory texture, escalating through layering fragments that deepen perceptual reality. Under the accumulative lens, density increases drive agency, with cost felt in the protagonist's "nameless identity" and survival. Closure forecloses the erased path with tangible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of erased histories emerges through layered narratives and the poison label revelation, not direct statement. Subtext operates in spectral images and fragmented tales. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through reclamation, avoiding moralizing while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature filtering reality through "echoes of untold pasts." Voice is consistent and lyrical, modulating with tidal rhythms. Purposeful elision in fragment collection is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative but maintains clarity and propulsion, with varied rhythm and sensory specificity. Minor overwriting in phrases like "translucent skins" occurs but doesn't obscure causality. No major loops or artifacts; closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes erased histories and perceptual filtering in a fresh, non-obvious way. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the poison label and tidal timeframe. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
