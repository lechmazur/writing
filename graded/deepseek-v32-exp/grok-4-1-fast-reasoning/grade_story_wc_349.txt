<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his role as vendor seeking personal unraveling. Interiority is concrete through quantified absences and embodied ritual actions. Final choice to descend is earned by prior causality, though some abstract language slightly weakens peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual repricing as Elias vanishes into absence, reconfiguring the story's premise with cost legible in "slate dissolving to motes." Accumulative/textural lens holds strong through quantified absence pattern. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with glass orchard and cloud sea constraining choices and charging the final image of "infinite blank pages." Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elias's agency in incising absences, tightening under accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable in his vanishing, foreclosing his vendor identity. One meaningful deepening drives the narrative to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of absence as origin emerges through particulars like quantified voids and glimmering parole. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic rhythm, though minor figurative density in peaks like "integrated, not broken" slightly blurs clarity. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is strong.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, but some overwriting in metaphors like "fragmentation—integrated, not broken" causes minor muddle. No major loops or scaffolds; momentum remains strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is highly original with fresh synthesis of quantifying absence and floating library. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable from established pattern.</comment>
