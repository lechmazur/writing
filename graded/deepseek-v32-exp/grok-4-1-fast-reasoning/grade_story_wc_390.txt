<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in backstory, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. The trait "logically emotional" is demonstrated through his assessment of perils and emotional surges, driving adaptation. However, minor overwriting in phrases like "fleshly glow" slightly reduces specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with clear inciting incident, escalation, and closure featuring a decisive change (wraiths absolved) and felt cost (tears, peace). Orientation is anchored early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity, with the key's use shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as shifting ice and fading light affecting Elias's sprint. The drift-ice marina and lighthouse charge the final image, with sensory details like "groaning floes" integrated into action and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start, with escalation driven by Elias's agency under the causal lens, adapting to wraiths' advance. Cost is legible in the emotional catharsis and transformational resolution, though the climax relies slightly on a late-introduced method.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of absolution and logical-emotional balance emerges through events and imagery, such as vibrational matching, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with complexity, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice and perceptual signature, such as "sunlight bled across the water." Prose rhythm controls pressure, though some elevated diction in peak beats slightly clashes with the engineer's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid with varied rhythm, but overwriting in metaphors like "fleshly ethereal" and occasional strained imagery reduces clarity. No major loops or scaffolds, but figurative language in high-pressure beats adds minor muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lighthouse engineering, crypt key, and sonic absolution feels fresh and inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details. Risk-taking in tone and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, though some elements echo familiar fantasy motifs.</comment>
