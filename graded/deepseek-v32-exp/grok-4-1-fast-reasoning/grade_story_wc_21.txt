<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion (fingers trembling, heart racing) and micro-choices (arranging debris) that reveal his values. His retrocognitive trapping adds internal conflict, and the final resolve is earned by prior causality. However, minor passivity in the initial discovery slightly limits agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change: Elias gains truths and resolves to act, with cost legible in his "drenched" awakening and emotional toll. The Hybrid drive lens (causal-retrocognition and accumulative-imagery) holds, and orientation is clear early. The diary's transformation charges the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details (zeppelin's sway, scorching dunes) are filtered through POV and constrain choices, such as the obsidian lagoon enabling the parley. The environment charges the final image, with debris and lagoon integral to closure. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering truth vs. entrapment) escalates through Elias's agency in the debris parley, narrowing options under the Hybrid lens. Cost is felt in the risk of "eternal entrapment" and emotional revelation. One meaningful tightening occurs with the guardians' demand.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth and justice emerges organically from events (letters, retrocognition, debris messages) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via "dunes whispering justice," reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in silence and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful compression (e.g., retrocognitive leap) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; internal perception remains coherent and character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "searing pull") occurs but does not obscure clarity or closure. No significant loops or scaffolds; propulsion is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of civil-rights archivism, retrocognition, and dystopian elements feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details like the debris method. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure is fully integrated.</comment>
