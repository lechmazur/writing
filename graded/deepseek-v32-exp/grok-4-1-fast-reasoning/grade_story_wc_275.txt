<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's pacifist motivation is clear and consistent, driving key choices like sheathing the dagger and using plants defensively. However, her steadfastness lacks internal contradiction or flawed struggle, limiting depth. Embodied emotions, such as "heart steady as desert stone," anchor her character, but the absence of contradictory impulses under pressure prevents higher scores.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages: finding the sandbag enables her defense, leading to looters' repulsion and Jax's softening. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in "the bounty hunter softened, seeing chaos tamed by her blaze." Orientation is immediate, and structure is coherent in a single scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The glass-domed farm and desert setting actively pressure choices through the breach and roses, constraining tactics. Sensory details like "sunset light blazed... igniting the roses" are selective and POV-filtered. The sandbag and roses function as micro-settings that charge the final image of engraved petals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of defending peace escalates through Elara's agency under causal lens: she uses inculcated plants to trip and disorient looters. Cost is visible in the risk of violence and her vow's test. One meaningful tightening occurs when vines lash out, narrowing options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of pacifism and continuity emerges organically through events like mixing the sandbag into soil and the roses' evolved traits. Subtext operates in images, such as petals mimicking "QUIET" script. The ending offers a non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with Elara's "senselessly perceptive" trait coloring narration. Voice is distinct and rhythmic, though minor register consistency issues arise in peak beats. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language like "petals a serene inferno" is purposeful and clear. Closure image remains undulled by overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of pacifism in a post-apocalyptic setting with plant communication feels inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the sandbag's engraving. Risk-taking in non-violent resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry, though some elements echo familiar motifs.</comment>
