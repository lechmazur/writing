<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theo's motivation is clear and consistent, driving his actions from dust analysis to engaging the ghost; his final choice to uncover the bones is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the burden lifting. Interiority is concrete and embodied, though minor lack of contradictory impulses limits peak score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages; closure is a decisive change with felt cost as ghosts dissolve and Theo's burden lightens. Orientation is anchored early, and the persistent constraint of his compulsion shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like mildew and dust patterns; the environment constrains choices (e.g., dust leads to ceiling cracks) and charges the final image of bones and release. POV filtering is consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Theo's agency under causal lens, from observing anomalies to unlocking the grate; cost is unmistakable in the ghosts' release and his lightened burden. One meaningful tightening forecloses options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of façades cracking emerges organically from events and images like ceiling fissures and the mainspring; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in ghostly regrets, though slightly overt at points.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is observant and rhythmic, modulating under pressure. Minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats. Sentences advance story with propulsion and clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes elevator tech and ghosts with originality; specific details like circus setting and mainspring barrel feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in tone and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
