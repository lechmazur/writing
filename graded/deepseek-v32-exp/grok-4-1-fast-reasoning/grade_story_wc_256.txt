<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation is clear and intensifies through embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. Her internal conflict and questioning assumptions drive earned change, with cost visible in tears at closure. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) and cost under accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and causality holds through the artificial pilgrimage structure, with persistent constraints shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details with golden shadows and sonic elements constraining choices and charging the final image. The carbide lamp lens as micro-setting actively alters tactics, and spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elowen's agency in using the lens and bells, with cost legible in emotional shifts and narrowed options. Under accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of connection emerges through concrete events and images, with non-literal resolution in the gritty texture realization. Subtext operates in implication, avoiding moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable POV with distinct perceptual signature focused on sound and texture. Rhythmic prose controls pressure without head-hopping, and purposeful elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dense, poetic prose with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops or scaffold artifacts, and figurative language remains coherent and purposeful even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of quest tropes into a sonic pilgrimage, with specific details like prism-song bells feeling inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
