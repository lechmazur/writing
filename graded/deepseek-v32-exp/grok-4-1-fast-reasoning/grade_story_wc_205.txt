<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his past as a revolutionary, driving his actions with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as inscribing plans in verse. His final choice to destroy the shard is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in foreclosing personal redemption. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with coherent because/therefore linkages, from Elias's motivation to his devised plan and climax. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing as he reconfigures the Aetherian narrative, with cost legible in the shard's destruction seeding unrest. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the baroque asteroid and temporal storms constraining choices, such as the mirror gallery enabling Elias's ingress. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, charging the final image where the environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the causal lens through Elias's agency, from eavesdropping to seizing the shard during the storm, with a meaningful tightening that narrows options. Cost is visible in the shard's destruction, forcing a trade-off between possession and provocation, though the personal stake slightly limits scale.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of revolution and narrative control emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in Elias's reimagining of the Aetherians. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image of echoes refracting eternal, avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable single POV and perceptual signature evident in Elias's lyrical observations. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present, and elision is purposeful, such as the planned verse, without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, but minor overwriting in peak beats, like "burnished sorrow" repetition, slightly dulls momentum without obscuring causality. No major artifacts or loops; rhythm and syntax vary purposefully to support pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of baroque setting, visible time, and archaeological dispute, transformed through character-specific choices. Risk-taking in structure and tone heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
