<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in curiosity, driving high-stakes choices like the climb and signal setup. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (breath fogging visor, oxygen warning). The final endurance is earned with visible cost, though some internal conflict is summarized rather than dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with closure via Conceptual Repricing—the grain's micro-etchings reweight exploration's cost. Causality is tight, with oxygen depletion escalating stakes. Orientation is clear early; cost is legible in the oxygen gauge and rescue timing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lunar setting is vividly specific and constrains choices (jagged height limits access, oxygen depletion). Sensory details (ghostly silver light, regolith) are purposeful and POV-filtered. The grain as micro-setting charges the final image with thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (surviving to photograph the relic) escalates under Accumulative lens through oxygen depletion and timed signals. Agency in chemical reactions narrows options with cost (oxygen warning). One meaningful tightening forecloses immediate return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of exploration's fleeting triumphs emerges through the grain's endurance and final micro-etchings, not statement. Subtext in melancholy tone and imagery offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Earned through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (poetic, observant). Voice controls rhythm under pressure, though some register drift occurs ("dawnlit melancholy" repetition). No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with varied rhythm and high information density. Some overwriting (e.g., stacked metaphors in "clawed at the crater's rim like forgotten dreams") and minor paraphrase loops, but clarity and momentum are maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lunar exploration with relic recovery, transformed through specific details (chemical signals, micro-etchings). Risk in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight, resisting template plots.</comment>
