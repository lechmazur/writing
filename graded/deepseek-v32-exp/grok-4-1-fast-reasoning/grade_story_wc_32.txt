<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's hopelessness and sensitivity are concretely embodied through his iterative failures and stoic resolve, with his final choice of creative destruction earned by prior causality and visible cost in the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The causal lens holds tightly from failed approximations to the closure's decisive change, with the ember nexus and creative destruction constraining tactics and the living tree reconfiguring destiny with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ember nexus and frozen blooms are vividly sensory and purposefully constrain Elias's choices, while the crozier as micro-setting charges the final image of rebirth, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
