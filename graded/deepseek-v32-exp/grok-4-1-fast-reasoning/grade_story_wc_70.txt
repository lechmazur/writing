<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to preserve wonder is clear and consistent, driving his choice to use the lacquer box. His involuntary truthfulness constrains actions and adds cost, but internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak beats, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Mira ascends the tower, reconfiguring the city's future with felt cost under a causal lens. Orientation is anchored early, and the curse persistently shapes tactics, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lacquer box and matchbox function as micro-setting elements that constrain choices and charge the final image, with vivid sensory details like "nectar dusk" integrated into action. The tower environment pressures decisions, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes around preserving wonder escalate through Elias's agency in delivering the riddle, narrowing options under the causal lens. Cost is legible in the shattered routine, but escalation lacks a tightening trade-off for higher bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wonder versus routine emerges through the riddle and final image of "electric honey," offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in gestures and implication enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending poetic diction like "nectar dusk" with Elias's internal voice. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though minor register consistency issues prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "spilled honey" is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes cursed truth-telling and drone beehive failure with specificity, transforming tropes through grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyrical tone heightens stakes, but familiarity in the "preserve wonder" arc limits uniqueness.</comment>
