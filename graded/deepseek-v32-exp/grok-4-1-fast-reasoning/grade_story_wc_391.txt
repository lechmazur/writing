<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotions and contradictory impulses (impatience vs. patience) acting simultaneously in scene. Her final choice to unyoke the viaduct is earned by prior causality, including her botched scout experience and Kai's mentorship, with visible cost in the sparks and freed souls. Micro-choices under pressure, like restraining her wildness to track moon paths, reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Decisive Change with Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara unyokes the viaduct, freeing minds and reconfiguring her internal state, with cost legible in "shower of blue sparks" and "freed souls stirred." Causal drive lens holds tightly from setup to payoff, with orientation anchored early. No causality breaks; the moon path alignment and viaduct vulnerability are established and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated, with the frozen lake and basalt sanctuary constraining choices (ice allows crossing, sanctuary provides refuge) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like "whale-oil lamps" and "rain-slicked surfaces frozen in crystalline webs," filtered through Elara's POV. Environmental details mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freeing minds from neural clamps) is signaled early and escalates under causal lens through Elara's agency: tracking moon paths, timing the attack, and unyoking the viaduct. Cost is unmistakable in the viaduct's shudder and sparks, with a meaningful tightening as lunar alignment weakens fields. No coincidence; resolution earned by protagonist's alteration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of patience vs. impatience emerges through events and images, not direct statement, with subtext in Kai's aphorisms and Elara's actions. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via "impatience sculpted into patience," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through concrete particulars like "cracks in basalt birthing new paths."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled, e.g., "restrained wildness breathed free." Prose rhythm varies with pressure, and elision (e.g., moon path mechanics) is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven when present, as in Kai's counsel. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "like cracks in basalt," without muddle in peak beats. No loops, scaffold, or redundancy; closure image is sharp. Minor overwriting in dense descriptions, but clarity remains.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing sci-fi elements (magnetic viaduct, neural clamps) with literary prose and a fresh angle on revolution through patience. Tropes are transformed via specific details like horizon mapping and moon tracking. Risk-taking in style heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
