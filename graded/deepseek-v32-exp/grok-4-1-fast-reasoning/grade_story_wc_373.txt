<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices driving the narrative. Her "curiously steadfast" resolve is shown through repeated attempts, earning the final action with visible cost. However, some persistence is told rather than fully dramatized in depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with Lila capturing the sound and breaking the truce, cost legible in the chaos and violence. Causal lens holds tightly from false starts to climax, oriented early, and sunrise constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the pirate market and pier pressuring choices and charging the final image. The watch fob and environment constrain actions, integrating seamlessly with POV perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lila's agency through false starts, tightening options under causal lens until the climax where cost is unmistakable in the shattered truce. Dominant stake is clear and tested throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of trust and betrayal emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in dialogue and the fob's symbolism. Ending offers resonant ambiguity without moralizing, though some thematic echoes are slightly overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. Voice remains coherent under pressure, with purposeful elision and no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats, with strong propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is freshly original with the concept of bottling sound, transforming pirate tropes through specific character stakes. Risk-taking heightens coherence, and synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
