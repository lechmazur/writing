<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "fingers brushing the cold metal"); final choice to heat the ring is earned by prior causality with visible cost (her gasp of breath). Contradictory impulses act in scene during hesitation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with felt cost (her cry and first unassisted breath); causal drive lens holds consistently; orientation is anchored early; persistent constraint (the threshold) shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory detail filtered through POV; the threshold as a key object constrains choice and charges the final image; spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (maintaining solitude vs. dependency) is signaled early; escalation is driven by protagonist agency (ring materialization, putting it on, heating it) under causal lens; cost is legible on-page in her reaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of independence emerges through events and images without moralizing; subtext operates in gestures like heating the ring; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("to breathe is to release").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deep with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and rhythmic, controlled under pressure; no head-hopping or elision issues; prose reflects character's mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion; no loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is consistent and purposeful; rhythm varies naturally with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and organic, transforming dependency tropes through specific details; emotional truth is specific; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
