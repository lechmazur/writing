<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lir's motivation is clear and rooted in loss, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as pressing his palm for hours. However, the lack of on-page relationships and limited contradictory impulses slightly reduce depth, though the final choice feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Lir's tears freeze and he steps onto the map, reconfiguring loss into direction under an accumulative lens. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of patience shapes tactics, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The withered orchard constrains choices by supplying discarded items for the pattern, charging the final image with frost-dusted memory. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Lir's POV, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early with heartbeats as maps, escalating through pattern-building and the seal action under the accumulative lens. Agency drives the escalation, with cost legible in Lir's sweat and tears, though the pace is gradual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of loss becoming direction emerges through concrete actions and images, like the map of soul's migration, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Eira's ascending path, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and third-person limited to Lir, with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful elision, such as "moving stillness," is taught and paid off at closure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language serving purpose without muddle. Minor overwriting in dense metaphors exists but doesn't harm closure; no loops or scaffold artifacts detract from clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of flash-paper alchemy and heartbeat translation is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specific details anchor originality.</comment>
