<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving his meticulous actions under pressure, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses and emotions are somewhat abstract, with limited embodied conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as vows are stabilized and library ascends, under an accumulative/textural lens; orientation is clear early, and the fading illusions provide persistent constraint, though causality is straightforward.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The frozen library setting vividly pressures choices through chill and decay, with sensory details woven into action; the ice wall and quartz constrain tactics and charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes of salvaging vows escalate through frequency measurement, driven by Elias's agency; cost is legible in decay and library's descent, but escalation is gradual under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of preserving meaning emerges organically from vows and decay; ending offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing, with subtext in fading illusions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., fading illusions) is taught and paid off, though no dialogue is present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with purposeful figurative language, but slight overwriting in peak beats and repetitive use of "gently meticulous" causes minor artifact without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Concept of measuring vows in a frozen library feels fresh and specific; synthesis of elements is inevitable in hindsight, with risk in poetic density heightening stakes.</comment>
