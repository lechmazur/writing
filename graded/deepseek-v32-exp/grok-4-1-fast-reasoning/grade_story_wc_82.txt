<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elar's grief-driven motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His craftiness informs key actions, and the transformation feels earned by prior causality, though minor diagnostic language ("luminous torment") appears but is dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (lighter after cranes release), under an Accumulative lens. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without contradiction, with the basilica and gems shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the floating island tea garden and glass basilica constraining choices (e.g., basilica amplifies dreams) and charging the final image. Details are selective and woven through action, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transforming grief) escalates under Accumulative lens through Elar's agency (polishing gems, folding cranes). Cost is legible in emotional release, and one meaningful tightening (dream recording to crane folding) forecloses options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of grief and transformation emerges through concrete images (origami cranes, dream recording) without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the cranes' release, avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control under pressure. Perceptual signature is character-specific (craft-focused), and any elision (e.g., shadow detachment) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, though minor overwriting ("luminous torment" repetition) doesn't harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of dream recording, origami, and floating island feels inevitable, with risk-taking in metaphorical depth. Elements serve character and conflict organically, transforming tropes through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
