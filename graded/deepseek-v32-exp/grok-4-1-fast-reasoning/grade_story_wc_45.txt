<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing the boxwood with callused fingers. Her transformation from skeptic to believer is earned through causal events, with visible cost in the mending of her certainty. However, the rapid shift in belief feels slightly accelerated for the length, though justified by the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with Elara's conceptual repricing of doubt and belief, felt cost in the fused tooth and her new purpose. Causal lens holds strong from inciting incident (substitute body) through discovery and ritual. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image—the maze and garden pressure Elara's navigation, and the sundial and tooth are micro-settings that shape the closure. Sensory details are vivid and selective, filtered through her POV, with purposeful economy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal belief vs. skepticism) escalates under causal lens through Elara's agency in discovering the tooth and performing the ritual. Cost is legible in her certainty cleft mending, foreclosing her skeptical path. One meaningful tightening suffices, though the escalation is slightly reliant on reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of belief reborn from doubt emerges through particulars like the tooth and constellations, not statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the tooth fusing and doubt reconfigured. Subtext operates in imagery and implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping. Elision (e.g., childhood memories) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative but purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "yearning deeper") causes slight muddle, but no major artifacts obscure causality or closure. Sentence-level propulsion maintains momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of changeling lore with personal arc feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like the bone-setting method. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure commits fully to the premise.</comment>
