<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to evolve tradition is clear and consistent, driving her key choice to unseal the embryo. Interiority is embodied (e.g., "her breath caught"), but internal conflict is minimal, with no contradictory impulses shown in scene. The final decision feels earned by prior causality, though it lacks the depth of high-band characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages from plant whisper to unsealing. Closure is a decisive change (hybrid sapling growth) with felt cost in tradition's evolution. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of tradition shapes tactics, though the telepathy convenience slightly limits impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory ("steaming volcanic hot springs," "obsidian rocks"), constraining choice at the climax in the Primordial Pool. Details are POV-filtered and integrated into action, charging the final image of the glowing grove with atmospheric weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (evolving tradition) escalates through Mira's agency under causal lens, from decoding the script to unsealing the embryo. Cost is legible in the foreclosed path of static tradition, though escalation lacks multiple reversals, fitting the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images (e.g., hybrid sapling as evolution symbol), with subtext in plant guidance and kite script. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the final declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature ("her mind flooded with the plant's ancient memories"). Voice is poetic yet consistent, and dialogue (brief declaration) feels natural. No head-hopping, but minor ornate density persists.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, but slight overwriting in figurative language ("flutter like a banner") without clarity loss. No major artifacts or loops; propulsion remains strong through closure, though some sentences could be tighter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes insurgent grandmother, plant telepathy, and implanted destiny with freshness and specificity. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
