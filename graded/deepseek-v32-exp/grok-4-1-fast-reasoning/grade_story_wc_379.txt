<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot with embodied emotions like "sandstorm calm." Her actions under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final community healing is earned through prior causality. However, the lack of contradictory impulses in scene prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the mailbox opening and emotional cost legible in "tears mingled with courtyard mist." The causal lens holds tightly from locket discovery to clue piecing, and the orientation is clear within the first paragraph. Persistent constraints like the locket and stories shape tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, from the "dew-kissed jasmine" to the courtyard's spatial choreography, constraining choices as the mailbox location guides the climax. The locket functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image with reweighted meaning. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elena's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elena's agency in listening and piecing clues, under the causal lens, with cost unmistakable in the emotional release of read letters. The dominant stake of healing community divisions tightens through storytelling beats and outside intrusion. Protagonist alteration is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of listening healing divides emerges organically from events and images, such as the mailbox yielding "words that had festered unheard." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the symbol of the locket and heard hearts. Minor explicit statements like "proving her creed" slightly reduce ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with Elena's perceptual signature evident in phrases like "sandstorm calm." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present, but the voice occasionally leans toward poetic abstraction under pressure. No head-hopping, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language like "sandstorm calm" is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity. Sentence-level propulsion varies effectively with scene needs, and the closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes thrift-store curation with community mystery in a fresh, non-obvious way, transformed through specific details like the locket's engraving. Turns feel earned in hindsight, and emotional truth avoids generic templates. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
