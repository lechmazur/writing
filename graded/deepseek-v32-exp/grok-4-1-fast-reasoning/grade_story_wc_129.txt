<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to graft onto community is clear and intensifies, driving her choices; embodied interiority like "luminescent ache" and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., approaching Lir) reveal consistent traits. The final sculpture grafts her solitude onto collective spirit, earning the change with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara's sculpture binds the group, with cost legible in transformed isolation. Orientation is clear early, and the search pattern escalates coherently to the arbor's discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the crystalline orchard and crater shaping the search; the obsidian arbor constrains the final choice by hosting the sculpture, charging the closure image with captured glow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of connection escalates under accumulative lens through shared search; Elara's agency in weaving the sculpture drives deepening, with cost unmistakable as isolation dissolves into shared ache.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of kinship emerges organically through images and actions like the reed webs, without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the sculpted embrace, reweighting prior longing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is selective (e.g., frost-kissed branches), and elision (e.g., tag migrations) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "luminescent ache" is coherent and purposeful, propelling momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of marsh-reed sculptor, crystalline setting, and webs of kinship feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure integrates elements seamlessly.</comment>
