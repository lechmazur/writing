<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her traits as a dreamer, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. The final surrender is earned through prior causality, though some interiority edges toward abstraction in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early, and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—eternal connection to the stars—under an accumulative/textural lens that holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (auroras, frost-kissed threshold) are selective and purposeful; the astrolabe as micro-setting constrains choice and charges the final image, enhancing pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency in tracing stars and surrendering to rest, under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in her eternal longing. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of creativity as stardust emerges organically from events and imagery, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end—no moralizing, but minor abstraction in concept delivery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature; no head-hopping, and elision (e.g., unwritten calendar) is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical prose has high density and rhythm, but slight overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "shimmering auroras danced") causes minor drag without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cosmic creativity and surrender feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in accumulative style that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
