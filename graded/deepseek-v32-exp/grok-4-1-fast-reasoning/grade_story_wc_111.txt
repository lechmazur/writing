<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent pragmatism, with interiority shown through embodied actions like polishing marbles. His final choice to use the marbles in the ritual is earned by prior causality, demonstrating a hierarchy of values under pressure. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a conceptual repricing as the transformed marbles redefine luck's malleability, cost legible in the new heart marble's high scan. Accumulative lens holds throughout, with patterns of blooming and withering escalating to a decisive change. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph, anchoring who, where, and when.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The garden maze constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "crimson roses thrusting defiantly" filtering through Elias's POV. Setting pressure is integral to the conflict, altering tactics and supporting the theme. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite the labyrinth's complexity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of saving the maze escalates through the auditors' arrival, driven by Elias's agency in polishing marbles. Cost is legible in the scanners' leap and the garden's response, narrowing options under the accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening occurs at the climax with the marble transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of luck as malleable and gardens remembering caretakers emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in rituals like arranging "withering blooms into mandalas." Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, voice modulated through lyrical yet pragmatic prose. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present, as in Thorne's declaration. Rhythmic control under pressure supports clarity, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and purposeful figurative language. Minor overwriting in phrases like "paradox of blooming opulence and withering decay" is voice-motivated and does not obscure closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts harm momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines through a non-obvious synthesis of measurable luck and garden lore, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative structure and lyrical prose heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details like cracked marbles transform familiar tropes through character-driven choices.</comment>
