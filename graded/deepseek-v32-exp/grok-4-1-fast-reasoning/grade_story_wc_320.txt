<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to discard assumptions and use unique tools under pressure. Her interiority is concrete, shown through embodied actions like closing her eyes to attune, and her final choice is earned by prior causality. However, the internal conflict during assumption-discarding lacks deep contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, slightly limiting emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—the city's rebirth—under a causal lens, fueled by Elara's actions and the perigee's pressure. Cost is legible in the risk of tower collapse and mental effort to discard creed. Orientation is early and clear, with no disorientation, and structure is a continuous scene with meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the abandoned radio tower city and gorge pressuring choices through creaking cables and the abyss. Micro-setting elements like the dish and tools constrain actions and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven into action, though the environment could more directly alter tactics beyond providing resources.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the causal lens, with perigee amplifying risks and Elara's agency driving the tuning process to avert disaster. Cost is unmistakable in the threat of collapse and the mental cost of discarding assumptions. The dominant stake of finding beginnings in endings is tested and resolved through her choices, foreclosing paths with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical renewal emerges implicitly through the signal's revelation and city's rebirth, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the celestial symphony, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in tools and imagery, though the theme could embrace more ambiguity in the resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct with a poetic yet practical texture, reflecting Elara's perceptual signature through selective detail and rhythm. POV is stable and single, with no head-hopping, and elision in assumption-discarding is taught and paid off. The prose maintains coherence under pressure, though dialogue is absent and not assessed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "practical magic, tuned true" is purposeful and clear. Minor register consistency in peak beats prevents a higher score, but clarity and propulsion are strong throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes fantastical elements with practical conflict in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming tropes through specific tools and setting. Risk-taking in unique objects and method pays off with coherence, and the closure feels inevitable. Emotional truth anchors originality, though the concept leans slightly on familiar renewal arcs.</comment>
