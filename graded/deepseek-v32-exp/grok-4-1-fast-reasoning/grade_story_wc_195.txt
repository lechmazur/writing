<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elowen's withdrawn nature and motivation to capture possibility are consistent and drive key choices; his internal conflict between solitude and being called forth is embodied in trembling anticipation and the pledged allegiance, earning the final mastery with visible cost of soul-binding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with Elowen seizing mastery over possibilities, cost legible in soul-binding to the spectral troupe; causal-driven hybrid lens holds from inciting incident to climax, with orientation clear early and no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly immersive with selective sensory details like dew-slick leaves and fracturing stars; the greenhouse and program constrain choices and charge the final image by amplifying shifts and enabling the climax, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of capturing possibility escalates through reality shifts and Elowen's agency in pledging allegiance and unsnapping the clasp; cost is legible in soul-binding, narrowing options under the causal lens with a meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of possibility and mastery emerges organically from events like the murmured allegiance and thread coalescence; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with Elowen's silence becoming legend's voice, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature reflects Elowen's withdrawn nature, and the murmured dialogue carries subtext, though minor register elevation in peaks doesn't harm clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and rhythmic with high information density, but slight overwriting in figurative language near peaks, like "factually mystical" repetition, causes minor momentum drag without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes knight, alchemy, and marionettes with fresh specificity; tropes are transformed through grounded choices in the orchard and program, and risk-taking in hybrid structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
