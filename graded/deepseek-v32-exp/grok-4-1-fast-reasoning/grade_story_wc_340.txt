<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's warmly inquisitive nature is consistently embodied and drives key choices; her realization of heritage is earned through the diary's causal revelations, with micro-choices under pressure showing internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change in identity and purpose, cost felt in affectionate detachment; causal lens holds tightly with elevator floors structuring escalation, orientation clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Icebound spire and elevator constrict choices, while goggles and scattered light charge the final image; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through diary deciphering under time pressure, driven by Lira's agency; cost is legible in emotional revelation and foreclosed paths, aligning with causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of joy beneath anguish emerges organically from diary particulars; ending reweights prior material without moralizing, offering resonant ambiguity through Lira's realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single PVO is stable and lyrical, with distinct perceptual signature; elision in deciphering is taught and paid off, though minor abstraction in peak beats slightly limits voice sharpness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with purposeful imagery; minor overwriting in phrases like "affectionate detachment" doesn't harm closure, but slightly reduces peak-beat clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elevator-as-narrative-structure and light-diffraction decryption are inventive syntheses; elements feel inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
