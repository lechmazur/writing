<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Elena pockets the coin and books a new gig, reconfiguring her despair into hope under a hybrid causal-accumulative lens.

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the mystic orchard garden and tarot coin constraining choices and charging the final image.
