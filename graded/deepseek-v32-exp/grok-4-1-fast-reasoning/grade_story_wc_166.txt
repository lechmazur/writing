<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion under pressure; her final choice to anchor to Kai is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the end of her exile.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with cost as Elara completes her verse and chooses mortal bond; causal lens holds tightly from anchor incident to resolution, with persistent constraints shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Twilight garden and stellar gaps constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, deeply integrated with POV perception and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through the anchor crisis; protagonist agency in observing gaps drives meaningful tightening, with legible cost in foreclosed exile and new commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of exile, art, and connection emerges organically through events and images; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively poetic, with perceptual signature consistent under pressure; elision in gap observation is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density, but minor figurative stacking in peak beats slightly reduces clarity without harming closure; no significant artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tide dancer, cosmic verse, and gap observation feels inevitable; risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, with transformative tropes.</comment>
