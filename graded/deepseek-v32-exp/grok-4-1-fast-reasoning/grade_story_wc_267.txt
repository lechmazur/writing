<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied, with nerve regeneration paralleling his emotional arc; his final choice to remain is earned by prior causality and reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Thorne's silent-choir motif is consistently shown through balletic gestures, avoiding stock phrasing. The resolution forecloses a path with felt cost, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in Elias's whisper and Thorne's frosty eyes; the causal lens holds tightly from discovery to realization. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the piano bench bolt's revelation drives a decisive change that reweights silence and safety.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress and snow constrict choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like "vaulted ice ceilings" filtering through Elias's POV. The spiral staircase and piano bench function as micro-settings that alter tactics and deepen theme, meeting the 9+ test for environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding the cost of safety—escalates through Elias's agency in discovering the bolt and accessing archived logs; cost is unmistakable in Thorne's grief and Elias's renewed isolation. Under the causal lens, one meaningful tightening (the bolt's discovery) narrows options and forces a trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of unpardonable silence emerges through particulars like the bolt's inscription and Thorne's backstory, not direct statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Elias's choice to remain, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and frosty regret.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature ("nerve regeneration phase" biasing perception) and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful elision (e.g., neural link access) is taught and pays off, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and propulsion, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold; figurative language like "frozen veins" is consistent and purposeful. Minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "seraphically mundane activity") does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of nerve regeneration, silent-choir bellhop, and unpardonable silence feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in lyric compression and thematic depth heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
