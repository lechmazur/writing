<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Thorne's motivation to collect stories is clear and drives his actions, with micro-choices like pressing ears to walls and probing chambers revealing character under pressure. However, interiority lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and emotional embodiment is more descriptive than deeply conflicted. The final endurance (Earned Stasis) is earned but misses the highest band due to limited internal complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Thorne finds fulfillment in listening, reconfiguring the axis from curse to chronicle with felt cost against the dreamless void. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through discoveries to a decisive conceptual repricing. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality remains tight with no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The silo library setting constrains choices (e.g., tilted shelves affecting movement) and charges the final image with the displaced axis thrumming beneath the tapestry. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, filtered through Thorne's perception, with economy and coherence. The environment actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative/textural lens occurs through Thorne's agency in probing and discovering diaries and tapestry, deepening stakes and narrowing options regarding the axis mystery. Cost is legible in his confrontation with the dreamless void and reconfiguration of purpose. One meaningful tightening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of myths bleeding into ruins emerges through particulars like the tapestry and axis shift, with subtext in dragon guardians and human hubris. The ending offers a non-literal answer through Thorne's fulfillment, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, rhythmic prose reflecting Thorne's obsessive curiosity. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., wall whispers) is taught and pays off at closure. Voice modulates with pressure, though minor register consistency holds it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without significant loops or artifacts. Minor overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "bronze quiet" repetition) doesn't obscure closure. Sentences propel momentum, and clarity is maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic library, displaced axis, and medieval tapestry feels inevitable, with specific details transforming tropes. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The premise is fresh and fully committed, with closure charging the integration.</comment>
