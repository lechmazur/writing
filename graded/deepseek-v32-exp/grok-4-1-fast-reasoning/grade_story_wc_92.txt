<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving key choices like decoding the sundial and sparking the revolution. Her calmly inventive trait is embodied in micro-choices under pressure, such as aligning the quill holder. However, some interiority edges toward telling rather than showing, like "her motivation burned quiet," slightly reducing immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—the revolution ignites—and cost is legible in the blackout's persistence and risk taken. Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages, e.g., the sundial decoding leads to crystal retrieval and network activation. Orientation is clear within 120 words, anchoring who, where, and when.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image: the phosphor veins and blackout pressure tactics, while the sundial and quill holder function as micro-settings that shape decoding. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like "cool stone" and "pulsed faintly," filtered through Elara's professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens, from anomaly detection to rebellion sparking, with cost legible in the blackout's cover and allies' mobilization. However, the stakes' visceral cost feels slightly muted, relying more on implication than on-page sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silent revolution emerges organically through images like the cradle of sparks and coded angles, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer in "the cradle rocked gently onward." Subtext operates in gestures and silence, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature like "winking hush" and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful compression, such as in the sundial decoding, is taught and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in peaks, e.g., "swallowed the light like a thief in velvet gloves," slightly muddles clarity but doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lock-sentinel intrigue and coded rebellion feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the poetic style heightening stakes. Specific details like the bronze quill holder and half-painted sundial transform familiar tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
