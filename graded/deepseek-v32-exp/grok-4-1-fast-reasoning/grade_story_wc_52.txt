<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "harvest lessons from loss" is clear and rooted in consistent traits, driving her to carve the locket. Interiority is concrete and embodied, such as "hands steady despite the ache," with micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to contain memories is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the transformation of grief. Contradictory impulses act in scene, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with cost as Elara snaps the locket shut, a Resonant Reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, with who, where, and when anchored by ~120 words. The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and the persistent constraint of grief shapes tactics. Cost is legible in the final image of contained eternity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the rain-beaded skylight loft and ash wood blank constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, such as "rust-hued peace" and tools smoothed by Theo's grip. Micro-setting elements like the carving blank evolve with action, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of internal conflict—harvesting lessons from loss—escalates through Elara's agency in carving the locket, under the accumulative lens. A meaningful deepening occurs as she summons the core concept "here and gone," narrowing options with cost legible in the foreclosed path of uncontained grief. Pressure coheres and tightens without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of "here and gone" emerges through events and images, not direct statement, with subtext in actions like crystallizing time. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the locket containing eternity, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, such as "rust-hued peace" and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is lyrical and character-specific, with purposeful compression in lines like "contained eternity while it boiled." No head-hopping or register drift; elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, e.g., "crystallized time," without muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level craft advances story efficiently, with strong verbs and specific nouns. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of grief magic through crystallized time, transforming the widow trope with specific, grounded choices. The premise feels organic and inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric design that heightens stakes. Emotional specificity and conceptual integrity avoid derivative patterns, supporting closure.</comment>
