<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Thorne's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with embodied emotion shown in micro-choices like trembling fingers. His inventive trait constrains actions, and the final optimistic shift is earned through prior causality, though interior contradiction could be more pronounced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in the trembling and pulsing stone, reconfiguring loss as a pivot under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and the mosaic patterns persistently shape tactics, but the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with stalactite drips and mosaic stone constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "whispering leaves" are filtered through POV, though spatial choreography is slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes in understanding loss escalate through Thorne's agency with the eyes and wand, leading to visions and a hum that narrow options. Cost is legible in his trembling and the orchard's response, driven by causal linkages.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of emotion's mathematics emerges through images like fractal equations, with a resonant, non-literal answer in loss as a pivot. Subtext in glass eyes as captured tears avoids moralizing, embracing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively lyrical, with rhythmic control under pressure. Perceptual signature is selective, e.g., "moonlight like silver needles," and elision is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Figurative language is consistent, but slight overwriting in peaks like "spectral reflections" slightly reduces propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of magic and math feels inevitable, with specific details like dovetail joints deepening stakes. Risk-taking in blending concepts heightens coherence without gimmickry, and emotional authenticity avoids templates.</comment>
