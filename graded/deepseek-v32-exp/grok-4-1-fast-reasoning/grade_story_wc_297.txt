<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with "anxious elation" embodying internal conflict. Her actions under pressure, like pressing the clipping to her scar, reveal character and drive the plot. The final choice to restore the covenant is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in pain and root-stirring. Minor abstraction in emotions prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the covenant restored and dreams stabilizing, under an accumulative/textural lens that builds intensity. Cost is legible in "pain flared" and roots "thrumming with new vigor." Orientation is clear early, and causality holds without breaks. The persistent constraint of being root-bound shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobalt glade constrains choices as Elara is root-bound, and the maze topiary clipping charges the final image. Sensory details like "pulsing blue hue" are selective and purposeful, integrated into action. Setting pressures tactics and mirrors internal states, elevating stakes without generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring the covenant escalates under the accumulative lens through Elara's agency in the ritual. Cost is unmistakable in "sap-blood mingled" and roots stirring, narrowing options. Pressure coheres from vision to nexus, with one meaningful tightening that forecloses chaos.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of mending futures emerges through events like the scar-linking ritual, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the covenant restored, reweighting prior material. Subtext in symbols like the clipping avoids moralizing, though slight abstraction lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, reflected in rhythmic control under pressure. Elision in visions is taught and pays off at closure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent, with dialogue (e.g., "I come") natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "veins under twilight's deepening veil" is purposeful and coherent. Minor purple tendencies in peak beats prevent a higher score, but clarity remains.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes quantum rifts and root-keepers with specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth in Elara's struggle avoids templates, and risk-taking in style heightens stakes. Fresh angle on dream-reality intersection with bold, coherent choices.</comment>
