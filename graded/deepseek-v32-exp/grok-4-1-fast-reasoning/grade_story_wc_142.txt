<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's dual allegiance is concretely embodied in her actions and micro-choices, such as using orderly plans intuitively for graffiti. Her final decision to reorganize the community is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the risks taken against enforcers. Interiority avoids stock phrasing, showing contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with clear because/therefore linkages from Kai's revelation to Elara's graffiti campaign. Closure is a decisive change where the community reorganizes, stalling gentrification, with cost legible in the "creak of ropes" and risks. Orientation is anchored early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the raft city's neon-lit frenzy and bioluminescent lanterns pressuring choices. The foundation stone chip and raft lashings constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Elara's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes against privatization escalate through Elara's agency, driven by her graffiti actions that narrow options and rally the community. Cost is unmistakable in the enforcer patrols and the realignment of rafts. One meaningful tightening under the causal lens forecloses developer advances.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of dual allegiance as a bridge emerges through events like the graffiti messages and raft realignment, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "rafts danced eternal," reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, such as Elara's intuitive orderliness mapping shock. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as with Kai's whispered revelation. Prose rhythm varies purposefully under pressure, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, but minor repetitive phrasing like "hopeful desperation" occurs without pattern-teaching. No major artifacts obscure closure; sentence-level rhythm supports scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of a culture shock absorber in a raft city is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Tropes like resistance are transformed through specific graffiti encoding and dual allegiance. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
