<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elar's motivation is clear and rooted in loss, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. His transformation from meek to determined is earned through causal actions, and the final change carries visible cost. Contradictory impulses (meekness vs. quiet determination) act in scene, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strong, with closure landing as a decisive change (planet reborn) and felt cost in Elar's effort. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraints (rubble, crystals) shape tactics. The ending image of stabilized arches and awakened stones charges the reconfiguration with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the orchard planet and mine shafts constraining choices (e.g., shaft acoustics amplify magic). Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, integrating into action. The environment directly pressures Elar's methods and charges the final image of floating sentinels.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving Lirath) escalates through Elar's agency under the causal lens, with cost legible in his sweat and effort. One meaningful tightening occurs as stones awaken, narrowing options and foreclosing decay. The resolution is earned by his deliberate actions, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges organically from events and images, such as bartered awakenings and rubble rebirth. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, e.g., the silk binding dreams to stone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic yet consistent prose. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and elision (e.g., time jumps) is taught and paid off. Dialogue with the magician carries subtext and advances plot without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffolds obscuring closure. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, supporting momentum without artifice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar tropes (blacksmith, magic) through specific details like azure defiance and bartered awakenings. The core premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in style heightening stakes. Emotional truth and transformation resist generic templates.</comment>
