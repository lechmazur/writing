<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied emotion in micro-choices like tracing the quartz. However, the "tremor of certainty" leans slightly diagnostic, and internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in scene, though the final choice is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure lands with cost as the poet transforms and crosses boundaries, reconfiguring meaning. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the quartz colonnade as a persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like the humming quartz and frozen lake constraining choices and charging the final image. The environment actively shapes the poet's actions and the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the poet's agency in paraphrasing, under the accumulative lens, increasing density and leading to a cost-legible transformation. The stake of crossing boundaries tightens meaningfully through his actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from imagery and action, offering a non-literal answer to boundaries through beauty without moralizing. Subtext in phrases like "beautiful surrender" deepens resonance, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature and rhythmic control that heightens pressure. No head-hopping; elision in paraphrasing is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and high information density. Minor figurative stacking in peaks, like "lantern-moth wisps," causes slight muddle but doesn't obscure closure; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of poet, boundaries, and paraphrasing feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric style that heightens stakes. Specific details like the quartz colonnade avoid template plots, offering freshness.</comment>
