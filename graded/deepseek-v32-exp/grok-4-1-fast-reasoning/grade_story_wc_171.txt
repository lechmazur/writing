<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted, driving the plot with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her internal conflict and past mistake earn the final blood-sealing act, though some interiority leans slightly abstract, such as "her motivation burned deep." The resolution forecloses a path with visible cost, satisfying the quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—the spectral vision and "quiet ache"—under a causal-hybrid lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the ritual's significance shapes tactics persistently. No causality breaks; the plot coheres from inciting incident to climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details like torchlight and moss-weathered marble constraining choices—the terrace and altar are central to the ritual. The environment charges the final image of "mended fractures," meeting the 9+ test for micro-setting impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency, from confronting delegates to blood-sealing the accord, with cost legible in her vision and hesitations. Under the causal lens, one meaningful tightening narrows options, though the escalation relies slightly on declarative persuasion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of redemption and the cost of peace emerges through concrete events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures like delegates shifting. The ending reweights prior material non-literally through "flawed beauty" and loss, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively lyrical, with rhythmic control under pressure and purposeful elision (e.g., celestial imagery). Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven, and perceptual signature remains coherent, though occasional poetic density may border on overwriting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and elegant with varied rhythm, advancing story efficiently. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., "sun lingered like a reluctant lover") does not harm clarity or closure; no loops or scaffolds detected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise feels fresh and specific, transforming the peace negotiator trope through lived detail and moral complexity. Risk-taking in prose heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the synthesis of ritual and redemption feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
