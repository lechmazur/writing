<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation to articulate unspoken needs is clear and consistent, driving her choices, but the lack of on-page contradictory impulses or internal conflict prevents the highest score, though her final action is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change and resonant reconfiguration as the ghost is freed, under a hybrid lens; the flower press bolt plate acts as a persistent constraint, and cost is legible in the thunder carrying truths.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The misty courtyard setting pressures choices through the graffiti art and ghost, with sensory details like cloud-moss pigments; the flower press bolt plate constrains action and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elowen's agency in encoding the ghost's plea, narrowing options under the hybrid lens; cost is unmistakable in the ghost's release and the thunder's echo of unspoken needs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of giving voice to the voiceless emerges through concrete actions and images, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via thunder carrying truths without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is clear in Elowen's attention to whispers, and patterned elision like the ghost's speech is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and rhythmic control; no loops or artifacts obscure causality, and figurative language like "tinkersong wonder" is consistent and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fantasy and modern concepts (e.g., digital specter in ancient setting) feels inevitable; risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
