<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Kai's motivation to appreciate hidden effort is clear and consistent, driving his actions from tea whisking to net mending, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure; final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost in honoring generational labor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration as Kai completes the net, feeling the cost of effort; accumulative/textural lens holds with patterns building to charged poise; orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in "Generations of net-menders had poured their souls."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the parapet, lagoon, and fireflies constraining Kai's choices and charging the final image; sensory details are purposeful and filtered through his philosophical POV, enhancing atmosphere without generic clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes in appreciating hidden effort escalate through Kai's agency in whistling and mending, with one meaningful tightening as he follows moon paths; cost is unmistakable in the net's rebirth and fireflies' somber sparkle, though escalation is subtle under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hidden effort emerges organically from concrete actions and images like the whisk and net, with a resonant, non-literal answer in the final honor to labor; no moralizing, and subtext operates through implication and pattern.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, poetic yet controlled voice, and rhythmic modulation; no head-hopping, and elision (e.g., moon paths) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story and atmosphere; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle, even in peak beats like the net mending, ensuring clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of net-mending and philosophy feels inevitable, with specific details transforming tropes; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure reweights prior material with freshness.</comment>
