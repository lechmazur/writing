<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices (e.g., trembling fingers, breath catching). His final vow is earned by prior causality, showcasing internal conflict and a credible change from archiver to potential participant, with visible cost in his loneliness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages; orientation is anchored early. Closure is a Charged Poise with felt cost (his whispered vow reconfigures options), and the prophecy acts as a persistent constraint shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices (e.g., orchard supplies rainwater for immersion). Sensory details are purposeful and charge the final image, with the skyscraper orchard mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (archiving emotions) escalates through Elias's agency in immersing the shaving, leading to a prophecy that narrows options and reveals cost (loneliness). Pressure coheres under the causal lens with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (preservation vs. participation, unfulfilled oaths), with subtext in the prophecy and Elias's realization. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and rhythmically controlled under pressure. Elision (e.g., memory trigger) is taught and pays off, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied syntax, with clear propulsion and no loops or scaffold. Minor overwriting in peaks (e.g., "velvet disquiet" repetition) slightly dulls momentum but doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of concepts (oath scribe, emotional archiving) feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style that heightens stakes. Specific details (e.g., wax cylinder) transform tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
