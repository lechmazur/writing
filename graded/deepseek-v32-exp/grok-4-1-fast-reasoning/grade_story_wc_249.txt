<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions like pain fueling her rebellion. Her final choice to escape with Kai is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the sorrowful transformation. Interiority is concrete, though "auroral sorrow" edges toward abstract labeling at peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in their escape into the dream, under an accumulative/textural lens. Causality is tight, from drumming to Kai's emergence, and orientation is clear early. The cost is legible in the final image of submerged freedom.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sound wave garden constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details like "iridescent petals" and the auric lagoon used tactically. Setting is integral to escalation, shaping Elara's drumming and the climax's emotional weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes of freedom escalate through Elara's drumming, driven by agency under the accumulative lens, with cost in the "auroral sorrow" and loss. One meaningful tightening occurs as her actions narrow options to the escape, though some intensifiers are slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of entanglement and rebellion emerges through images and actions, not statement, with subtext in gestures like drumming as defiance. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the submerged escape, avoiding moralizing while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, rhythmic control under pressure, and purposeful elision. Perception is character-specific, and dialogue is minimal but effective in Kai's murmured line, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, though figurative language like "auroral sorrow" risks slight overwriting in peak beats. No major artifacts; sentences advance story and atmosphere with clarity, and closure is undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of neural entanglement with a sound-based garden feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the concept commits fully to its implications.</comment>
