<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through concrete actions like guerrilla gardening. His internal conflict over the bakery's decline is embodied and drives the reconciliation with Mira. The final choice to tend the garden together is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the "tenuous absolution."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in the "creeping thaw" and fragile forgiveness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through patterns of neglect and reclamation. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the overgrown courtyard and secret tea house constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like frost and bread scent are filtered through POV, and micro-setting elements alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of personal reconciliation escalates through Mira's arrival and their conversation, driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the "fragile" absolution and vow to tend the garden, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of finding sacred in the ordinary emerges through particulars like the bread and garden, with subtext in gestures. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "creeping thaw" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and consistent. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. No head-hopping, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, with no artifacts obscuring closure. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of guerrilla gardening and personal redemption feels inevitable, with specific details elevating familiarity. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure is legible.</comment>
