<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by unyielding compassion and her history as an arsonist's daughter. Interiority is concrete and embodied through sensory details like callused hands and burn scars. The final grafting action is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in her scars. However, contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as Lira completes the graft and feels peace, reconfiguring her legacy with felt cost in scars and effort. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through symbolic images to the final moment. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight, with the graft action driven by established motives. Persistent constraints like scars shape tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the obsidian lagoon and kelp-drift peace filtering through Lira's POV. Micro-setting elements like the rootstock and black sand constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and integrated into action, enhancing atmosphere. The environment actively pressures Lira's healing ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of healing is signaled early and escalates under the accumulative lens through the grafting process. Lira's agency drives a meaningful tightening as the graft forecloses other paths, with cost legible in scars and effort. Pressure coheres and deepens, though the escalation is more gradual than abrupt. Cost is unmistakable but not intensely visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as grafting and the coin talisman, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Lira's whisper and the silent song of scars. Subtext operates in implication, and wisdom is earned through concrete particulars. Avoids sentimentality with purposeful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature reflective of Lira's perspective. Voice controls rhythm and diction under pressure, e.g., "kelp-drift peace." Dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping, though the voice occasionally leans toward exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "pulverized midnight," with no muddle in peak beats. Sentences propel momentum, and clarity is maintained throughout. Minor purple phrasing does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of arsonist's daughter firefighter and healing ritual, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Specific details like the obsidian lagoon and graft action transform tropes through grounded choices. Risk-taking in quiet, symbolic storytelling heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth and specificity avoid generic templates.</comment>
