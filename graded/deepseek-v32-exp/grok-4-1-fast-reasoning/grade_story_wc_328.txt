<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's bitterness and motivation are clear and drive the narrative; her internal conflict is embodied, and the metamorphosis feels earned through prior causality. However, some emotional moments edge toward abstraction, slightly reducing concrete specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change and felt cost as Elara's bitterness transmutes; the causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages from the arrowhead and phone confessions. Minor convenience in the phone's introduction is offset by early setup via Mira's mutterings.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The underground garden is vividly rendered with sensory detail and directly enables key actions; the flint arrowhead and phone charge the final image, constraining choices and enriching the climax's transformative hope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear with Elara's internal conflict escalating through agency; her confession triggers metamorphosis with visible cost, and the causal lens ensures pressure tightens meaningfully toward closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of bitterness transforming into hope emerges organically through events and images; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, deepened by the cosmic joke concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice; perceptual signature remains consistent under pressure, and dialogue (in confessions) carries subtext without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm and information density; minor overwriting in figurative language doesn't obscure closure, and no loops or scaffolds harm momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes fresh, non-obvious elements like the Missing Return and static-laden confessions; risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
