<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's rationality and desire for psychological safety are clear, consistent motives that drive his actions, such as using the glass eye. Internal conflict is shown in his decision to occlude the veritas nerve and his later doubt about the cost. Emotions are embodied, e.g., "pain bloomed, fractured and exquisite," and his final choice is earned through prior causality. The attribute of involuntary truthfulness constrains him authentically, and his micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with strong because/therefore linkages: finding the eye leads to its use and community change. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elias ponders the cost of deceit, with felt cost in his doubt. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds throughout. The eye acts as a persistent constraint shaping tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like "storms battered the ravine" and "gnarled trees clung," creating atmosphere that mirrors internal states. The hanging orchard and storms influence choices, e.g., truffles thriving in chaos. The glass eye as a micro-setting object constrains choice and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details are filtered through Elias's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of psychological safety is signaled early and escalates through Elias's agency in finding and using the eye. Cost is legible when he lies to Lira and Thom, fostering safety but incurring moral doubt. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, with one meaningful tightening. The trade-off between truth and deceit forces a visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus deceit emerges through events and images, not direct statement, e.g., the glass eye symbolizing "merciful shadows." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Elias's doubt, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like Lira's touch and dialogue implications. Emotional aftereffect lingers with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice reflected in phrases like "winds howled elegies." Perception is character-specific, e.g., Elias mapping paths with sensors. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, advancing plot in exchanges with Lira and Thom. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, with no head-hopping or unmotivated shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with high information density and varied syntax, e.g., "Pain bloomed, fractured and exquisite." No significant artifacts like loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and coherent. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats. Read-aloud rhythm is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes unique elements—post-virus truthfulness, truffle foraging, smuggled relic—into a fresh, non-obvious whole. Turns feel earned in hindsight, e.g., the eye's use arising from Elias's rationality. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The combination feels organic and indispensable.</comment>
