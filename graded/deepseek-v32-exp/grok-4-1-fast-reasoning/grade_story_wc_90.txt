<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's pacifism and motivation are clear, driving the narrative with interiority shown through shadow work; however, some emotions like "ghostly resolve" lean slightly stock, though micro-choices under pressure reveal consistent values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost (becoming lighter and stepping forward) under an accumulative lens; orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of pacifism shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the recycled spaceship and photographs constraining choices by activating the portal; sensory details are selective and purposeful, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early, and escalation is driven by Elara's agency in integrating shadows, with a legible cost in her transformation; under the accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of integration emerges from events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the stitched tapestry; no moralizing, and subtext operates in implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and ethereal, with a distinct perceptual signature; POV is stable, and rhythmic control supports pressure, though some poetic diction may slightly overwhelm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high density and varied rhythm, with minor overwriting in metaphors (e.g., "echoing void"), but no significant artifacts or loops; clarity and propulsion are maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is original, synthesizing pacifist AI with shadow work in a non-obvious way; risk-taking in style heightens stakes, and the integration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
