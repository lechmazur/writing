<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elowen's reticence and motivation to decode the pattern are consistently embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., tapping the crystal) leading to an earned testimony. Interiority is concrete, and her final choice forecloses a path with visible cost (tears, weathered innocence).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens, with Elowen's testimony embedding cost (tears, lifted hush) and the crystal's role shaping the final image. Orientation is clear early, and causality holds without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The library setting is vividly atmospheric with selective sensory details, and the crystal as a micro-setting object constrains choices (e.g., revealing sequences) and charges the closure image (winking farewell). Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elowen's agency under the accumulative lens, with the crystal's sequences deepening stakes and leading to her testimony, where cost is legible (cracking voice, tears). One meaningful tightening forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of language growth and silence emerges through events and images (fractal sequences, crystal), with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication and gesture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure (e.g., "fractured sequences erupted"). Voice is poetic yet consistent, and any elision (e.g., temporal jumps) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and vivid imagery, with no loops or artifacts harming closure. Minor overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "sonically reflective, a mirror not for light but for echoes") does not obscure sense or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of post-lexicon world and sonic crystal, with risk-taking in accumulative style heightening stakes. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, and specifics avoid template plots.</comment>
