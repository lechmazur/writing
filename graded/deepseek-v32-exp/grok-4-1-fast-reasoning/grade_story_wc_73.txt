<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's grim optimism is consistently embodied through micro-choices like dice-guided proofs, and his endurance at closure feels earned by prior causality with visible cost—the staircase's reformation. However, minor abstraction in capturing "texture" slightly limits concrete interiority under peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost—the staircase reforms, foreclosing escape but reweighting his understanding. The Hybrid drive lens holds, with causal proof attempts and accumulative texture culminating in the rupture; orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The infinite staircase functions as a micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image, with selective sensory details (e.g., "golden mean helix") filtered through Elias's POV to mirror internal states without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the Hybrid lens, from proof attempts to the rupture, narrowing options with legible cost—the temporary breach reinforces confinement. The dominant stake (escape/understanding) tightens meaningfully through mathematical daring.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the chipped die and proofs, offering a non-literal answer to confinement and regret at closure without moralizing. Subtext in the dice's asymmetry deepens the resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature biased toward philosophical abstraction ("grim optimist"). Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, though minor density in peak beats slightly tempers immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds; figurative language ("equations fracturing like glass") coheres and propels momentum, even in climax. No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mathematical rigor and existential confinement feels inevitable, with risk-taking in abstract concepts heightening stakes. The chipped die and perpetual motion are transformed through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
