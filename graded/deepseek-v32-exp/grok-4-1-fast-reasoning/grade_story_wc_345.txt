<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Characters are distinct with clear motivations rooted in their roles; internal conflicts like doubt and trust are embodied in micro-choices under pressure, such as Kael grumbling yet steadying the bell. The evolution from strangers to family is earned through shared labor, and the final choice to ring the bell is motivated by prior causality. However, some archetypal traits limit depth, but no stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies harm closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with cost legible in the collective effort and Lir's dissolution; causal drive lens holds tightly from Lir's messages to the bell's ringing. Orientation is anchored early with vivid setting details, and the persistent blight constraint shapes tactics. No causality breaks or unkept setups; the ending reconfigures stakes with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the orchard planet and floating arches pressuring choices (brambles tearing skin) and charging the closure through the butterfly garden and bell. Details are integrated into action and POV bias, avoiding exposition. The environment constrains tactics and mirrors internal states, such as the nebula's glow reflecting hope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving orchards) escalates under causal lens through protagonist agency, from doubt to collective bell-ringing, with cost visible in their unified effort. One meaningful tightening narrows options, and the resolution is earned without coincidence. Minor reliance on ghost's guidance slightly reduces agency, but pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of unity and restoration emerges organically from events like strangers becoming family and Lir's messages, with subtext in gestures and doubts. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through butterfly imagery, avoiding moralizing. Slightly overt in places, but earned wisdom and complexity prevent sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person with distinct poetic voice ("brambled hope"); dialogue is natural and goal-driven, advancing plot through subtext. Perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., Lir's origin) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; voice modulates with emotional pressure, though minor purple phrases occur.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm; sentences advance story without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is voice-motivated and clear, though slightly overwritten in peaks. Propulsion remains strong, and closure image is undulled by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements like orchard planet and ghost are synthesized freshly with emotional specificity; tropes are transformed through grounded choices. The premise offers a non-obvious angle, and risk-taking in lyric tone heightens stakes without gimmickry. Inevitable in hindsight, with no derivative echoes.</comment>
