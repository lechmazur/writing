<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elena's characterization is deeply embodied, with somatic markers of trauma concretely shaping her actions. Her internal conflict during the freeze and subsequent thaw shows contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to help the young artist is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the somatic response. Motivation to anchor optimism in realism is consistently rooted in her backstory and present micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost when Elena freezes, then moves forward to help others. The accumulative drive lens holds, building through sensory and emotional density. Orientation is clear early, and the photograph discovery incites a meaningful tightening. Cost is legible in the line "her body betrayed her first, a somatic marker igniting from gut to spine."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The arboretum setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with the cliff edge triggering trauma and the lighthouse whine morphing into the drone's buzz. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elena's POV. The environment mirrors internal states, as when "the plants didn't rage against the wind; they bent, rooted deeper."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with the freeze acting as a key tightening that narrows options. The somatic marker incident raises stakes, and cost is unmistakable in Elena's physical seizing. Her decision to help the young artist forecloses the path of isolation with visible cost. Dominant stake of internal conflict with trauma is signaled early and deepens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of endurance and adaptation emerges organically from events and images, such as the grafting metaphor and the pearl of stillness. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, like the photograph transforming from wound to endurance. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete through the final shared moment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Elena's trauma and expertise. Voice modulates under pressure, as in the compressed diction during the freeze. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present, carrying subtext. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, such as "pearl of stillness," and does not obscure clarity. Sentence-level propulsion varies with scene needs, accelerating during the freeze. Read-aloud ear test passes with varied openings and paragraph lengths.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality lies in the non-obvious synthesis of drone strike trauma, arboretum setting, and somatic markers. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and theme. The pearl of stillness concept feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
