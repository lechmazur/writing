<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and drives the plot; her internal conflict is embodied through trembling fingers and defiant declarations, and her final stance is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the lingering dread.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the exile reversed and family honor restored, but the lingering dread charges the final image with cost; the causal lens holds throughout, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting actively pressures choices through fog and swollen floors, and key objects like the copper nail constrain actions and charge the closure; sensory details are vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens, from decoding journals to confronting Hale; the cost is legible in Hale's confession and the unresolved dread, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of honor and truth emerge through events and images without moralizing; the ending reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity, as the dread implies greater exiles ahead.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a poetic, perceptual signature; elision in coded stanzas is taught and paid off, and dialogue advances plot naturally when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density, though minor figurative stacking in peak beats slightly obscures clarity; no major loops or scaffolds harm momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in tone and structure; the concept of reversible exile is transformed through specific character choices and closure cost.</comment>
