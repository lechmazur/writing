<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, driving her to lie and access sealed archives. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like "heart pounding," and micro-choices reveal her values. The final choice to archive the patch and accept job loss is earned by prior causality, though some telling moments slightly reduce depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change and cost (job loss for truth), under a causal lens that holds throughout. Orientation is anchored early, and the plot progresses via because/therefore linkages from anomaly spotting to investigation and revelation. The cost is legible in "the lie had cost her job, but gained a truth."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The digital archive setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices and charging the final image with the patch as a key object. Sensory details like "sterile hum" and "pixel glitches" reflect POV bias, and the environment pressures Elara's actions, though some descriptions lean slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from curiosity to high-risk investigation, driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens. Her lie narrows options and leads to discovery and job loss, with cost unmistakable on the page. The dominant stake of uncovering truth tightens meaningfully, though secondary stakes are less emphasized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and absence emerges organically from events and images, not statement, with subtext in "nothing truly vanished." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of Elara as "bridge to the deleted," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, e.g., "digital mausoleum," and perceptual signature filters through Elara's expertise. Dialogue in posts is natural and goal-driven, and elision (e.g., "sensed absence") is taught and pays off, though minor register consistency issues exist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm and information density, but minor repetitions like "sensed absence" create slight loops without harming closure. Syntax varies purposefully, and figurative language is generally coherent, though overwriting risks appear in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept synthesizes digital archives and space mystery with freshness, transformed through specific details like the patch and recurring numbers. Emotional truth and risk-taking in structure heighten stakes, and the resolution feels inevitable in hindsight, avoiding cliché.</comment>
