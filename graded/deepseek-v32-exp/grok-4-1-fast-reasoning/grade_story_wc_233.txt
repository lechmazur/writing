<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices like touching the pool. Her final transformation is earned by prior causality, though Thorne's underdevelopment slightly limits relational depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Elowen inhales starlight, scouring disenchantment; causal drive lens holds with tight linkage from dreams to ascent. Orientation is anchored early, and persistent constraint of dreams shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details like "cloaks whispering" and the grotto's cobalt glow constraining choices and charging the final image through Elowen's interaction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elowen's agency, from defying warnings to embracing the grotto's peril, with cost legible in her vengeful grace; stakes tighten meaningfully under the hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of disenchantment and power emerges through imagery like bleeding starlight, with the ending offering a non-literal answer via "power woven in menace" without moralizing.</comment>
