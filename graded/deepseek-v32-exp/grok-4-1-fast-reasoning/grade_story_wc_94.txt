<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority concrete and emotions embodied. His "furiously tranquil" state shows contradictory impulses acting in scene, and his final realization is earned by prior causality with visible cost when he understands scars as communal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias's changed perspective on scars) under a Causal lens, cost legible in his realization. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with no causality breaks, satisfying the quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details filtered through POV; the stormlit observatory charges the final image and affects atmosphere, though it does not directly constrain choices, meeting the quick test for environmental charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding scars) escalates through protagonist agency (responding to the envelope) under the Causal lens, with cost legible in Elias's realization and action. Quick test passed with unmistakable cost on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, with subtext in the poem and Elias's response; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, satisfying the quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Elias, with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice remains coherent under pressure, and any elision is taught and paid off, meeting the quick test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with purposeful poetic diction; no loops or figurative muddle in peak beats, and syntax varies naturally, satisfying the quick test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concept feels fresh and non-obvious, with specific synthesis (censored poet in stormlit vigil); risk-taking in poetic density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure reweights prior material inevitably.</comment>
