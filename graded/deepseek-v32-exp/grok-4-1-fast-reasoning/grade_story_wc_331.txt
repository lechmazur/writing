<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eliza's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her actions with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as persisting with the scarf despite resistance. Her eccentricity is shown, not told, through rituals, and the final choice to continue her quest is earned with visible cost from the hyperbolic temptation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as Eliza glimpses the story realm but resists full immersion, with cost legible when "hyperbolic space pulled at her" and a patron's cough grounds her. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through descriptive beats, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and specific, with the scientific poetry library and scarf constraining choices and charging the final image through sensory details like "footsteps echoed softly" and the scarf's "warmth a reawakened companion." Economy and POV filter are strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (finding where stories live), escalation is driven by Eliza's agency with the scarf and geometry, leading to reawakening with cost in the temptation to immerse. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the scarf and geometry, with subtext in imagery and a non-literal ending that reweights prior material without moralizing. The central question of story-space is answered resonantly through concrete events.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a poetic perceptual signature, e.g., "hushed scientific poetry library," and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "fractal elegies," and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and non-obvious, synthesizing hyperbolic geometry, analog memories, and poetic library into an organic whole. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
