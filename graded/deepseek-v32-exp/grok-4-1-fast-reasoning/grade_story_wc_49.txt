<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in memory and whimsy, driving her to restore sacred practices. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion like "eyes bright with mischief and memory," and micro-choices under pressure, such as tinkering with the loom, reveal her values. However, the characterization lacks deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a causal drive with clear because/therefore linkages: Elowen's actions lead to the remedy. Closure is a decisive change with cost legible in the blight retreating and practices restored, anchored early in orientation. The harvest moon alignment tightens options, but the cost is mildly felt rather than deeply impactful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details like "verdant arbor at dawn" and the vine tendril from the heartwood constraining choices and charging the final image. The environment integrates with action, mirroring internal states and providing resources that affect the outcome, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—healing the blight—escalates under the causal lens through Elowen's agency, such as singing forgotten songs to spin golden stories. Cost is legible in the renewed vigor and community revival, but the escalation lacks significant opposition or trade-offs, limiting higher band entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, focusing on memory and restoration without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the golden stories reviving practices, but it leans slightly overt in message rather than fully nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct whimsical voice, reflected in phrases like "laughter a soft chime." Perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., the alignment) is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but functional, though not deeply subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and dense with varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or artifacts. Sentences like "the gathering hush draped like a silken veil" show controlled figurative language that enhances atmosphere without muddle, meeting the 9+ test for clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The combination of whimsical tinkerer, vine tendril loom, and golden stories feels fresh and specific, transforming tropes through grounded details. Synthesis is inevitable in hindsight, but it doesn't take bold risks that significantly heighten stakes beyond coherence.</comment>
