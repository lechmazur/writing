<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in regret, with interiority shown through embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. The ghost bride's actions create key turns, and the final transcendence is earned with visible cost. Minor abstraction in some emotional moments prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with cost (Elias's death and spiritual union), under an accumulative/textural lens that holds. The bead as a persistent constraint shapes tactics, and orientation is clear early. Causality is tight from inciting incident to climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the greenhouse and bead constraining choices and charging the final image. The atmosphere of endless night and winter fields integrates seamlessly with action, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in his mortal dissolution. The dominant stake of transcendence tightens through resonant awakenings, though the venomous euphoria slightly abstracts the trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of debt and love emerges through particulars like the bead and hauntings, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in the ghost's actions and Elias's awakenings deepens reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature. Prose rhythm controls pressure, and elision (e.g., cameo appearances) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density, but minor overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "euphoria surged, bittersweet and deadly") slightly muddles peak beats. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of alchemy, ghost lore, and transcendent love feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details like the venom-apple vine and bead. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
