<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lir's motivation is clear and consistent, driving his actions from decoding leaves to building monuments. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotions like "mossy delight," and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., prodding the speck) reveal his values. The final descent to rebuild the arbor is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his transformative effort.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot follows an accumulative/textural lens with patterns building through Lir's actions, leading to a resonant reconfiguration at closure (arbor renewal). Causality is tight, with the leaf and speck inciting transformation. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible in the sylph's vow and Lir's legacy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, constraining choices (e.g., arbor tools used for prodding) and charging the final image of renewal. Sensory details like "ash flakes" and "moss-draped walkways" are selective and POV-filtered, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (mending the arbor) escalate through Lir's agency under the accumulative lens, from prodding the speck to summoning transformeds. Cost is visible in the effort and transformation, narrowing options toward renewal. One meaningful tightening occurs as prophecies clarify, driven by protagonist choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of renewal through remembrance emerges organically from events and images, not statement. Subtext in transformations and monuments resists moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer at closure. The final image of "monuments eternal" reweights prior material without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, reflected in rhythmic prose and perceptual bias (e.g., "mossy delight"). No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, and dialogue (sylph's speech) is natural and goal-driven, advancing plot with subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical but occasionally overwritten with stacked metaphors (e.g., "bioluminescent fungi" for motivation). However, no major artifacts obscure closure; sentences advance story with varied rhythm, and information density is high despite minor figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Concept is highly original, synthesizing skyborne arbor folklore with seed-sorting mechanics in a non-obvious way. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the moonstone speck, and risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
