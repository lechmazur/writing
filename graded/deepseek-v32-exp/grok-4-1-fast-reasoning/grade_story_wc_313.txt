<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in guilt, intensifying under pressure. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as kneeling to lift the label. The final choice to burn photographs is earned by prior causality with visible cost, fulfilling the quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (burning photographs) with felt cost, under an accumulative/textural lens that holds. The trail of photographs drives causality, and orientation is clear early. Cost is legible in the burning scene, but the wind chime's silence is underutilized, slightly reducing impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the ridgeway and resurfacing town constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through POV, such as "spires piercing the surface like forgotten accusations." Quick test satisfied as environment shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Elias's guilt) escalates through the photograph trail, tightening under accumulative lens. Protagonist agency drives escalation, with cost unmistakable in the burning act. One meaningful deepening changes knowledge and options, fulfilling the quick test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory and storytelling emerges naturally from events and images, without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like burning photographs, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Quick test met with reweighting prior material through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Prose is lyrical but consistent, with purposeful compression. No head-hopping; dialogue, when present, is natural and goal-driven. Quick test satisfied.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, but minor artifacts include repetitive phrasing like "mirrored hush" and slight overwriting in peaks. No loops or scaffold obscure closure; propulsion remains clear. Quick test nearly met with no figurative muddle in key beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concept of resurfacing town and memory trail is fresh, with tropes transformed through specific choices. Synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth and specificity elevate originality, meeting the quick test.</comment>
