<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his role, intensifying under pressure. His interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, and his final choice to invert the hourglass is earned by prior causality, though his emotional range is somewhat narrow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (sands reversed) and felt cost (warehouse sighs, vows to share wisdom). Causal lens holds tightly from jar discovery to hourglass turn, with orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The amber warehouse and cliffs pressure choices (e.g., jar discovery, button use) and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, with the environment constraining tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency in unscrambling the prophecy, narrowing options from doom to choice. Cost is legible in the prophecy's liberation and his vow, though the stakes shift abstractly at points.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of free will versus fate emerges through particulars (jar, buttons, hourglass) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the echoed song reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and rhythmic control. Elision (e.g., prophecy scramble) is taught and paid off, and perceptual signature remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density, though some figurative stacking occurs. No major loops or scaffolds; closure beat is clear with propelled syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hourglass turner, amber warehouse, and echo jar feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming familiar tropes.</comment>
