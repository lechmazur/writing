Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like his motivation surging, and micro-choices under pressure, such as testing the seed. The final decision to use the insights is earned by prior causality, though contradictory impulses are less pronounced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly with logical, step-by-step progression through orthogonal approaches.
