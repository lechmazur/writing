<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied internal conflict (e.g., "doubt gnawed") and micro-choices under pressure. His final decision to integrate the cog and confront surface cults is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his effort and resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost (integration of the cog and resolve to confront), under a coherent Causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and the plot escalates through logical, character-driven beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details (e.g., "bioluminescent fungi pulsed") that constrain choices (sedimentary layers guide digging) and charge the final image. The sunken city ruins pressure tactics and enrich atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving ancient methods vs. superstition) escalates through Elias's agency in digging through layers, narrowing options and culminating in a cost-legible integration. Under Causal lens, pressure coheres and tightens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of rationality vs. narrative emerges implicitly through events and images (e.g., the cog's revival), with subtext in Elias's actions. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—philosophical, slightly archaic voice that reflects Elias's mindset. Rhythmic control under pressure, and no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and propulsion, with varied syntax and purposeful figurative language. Minor density in peak beats (e.g., "abrasive calm" repetition) but no major artifacts obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic and philosophical elements, with specific details (e.g., chronometry in sunken city) transforming tropes. Risk-taking in dense prose heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
