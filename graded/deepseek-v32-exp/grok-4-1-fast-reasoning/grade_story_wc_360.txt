<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to quantify emotion is clear and drives the plot, with his habit of borrowing personalities fully integrated into the conflict. His internal conflict and embodied emotions under pressure are vivid, such as when he "staggered, clutching the press as her dread flooded his veins." The final understanding of transposed empathy as the ultimate equation is earned through prior causality, though minor abstraction in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The causal drive lens holds strongly, with Elias's actions leading to the transpose peak and closure via Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is clear early, and the closure lands with cost on-page: "Elias released the borrowed personality, Mira's dread ebbing back with a gasp." The halo fragment as a persistent constraint shapes tactics throughout, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The topaz workshop and halo fragment are vividly described and actively constrain choices, such as amplifying starlight and enabling the transpose. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtering through Elias's POV. The setting charges the final image, with "topaz gleamed eternally" reweighting the atmosphere, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the causal lens, with the transpose recoiling and imposing clear cost: "Elias reeled in the disorientation" and Mira's transformation. The dominant stake (quantifying emotion) tightens meaningfully, though the climax's intensity slightly relies on abstract amplification, preventing a full 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, with transposed empathy explored through specific actions and images rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "transposed empathy was the ultimate equation," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like Elias's "borrowed smile" deepens complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and third-person limited to Elias, with a distinct perceptual signature in rhythmic, poetic prose. Dialogue advances plot and carries subtext, as in Mira's fractured reading. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off at closure, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting in peak beats, such as "lucid turbulence" repetition, causes slight figurative muddle but does not obscure closure. No loops or scaffold; propulsion remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes transposed empathy and mathematics of emotion with specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structural ambiguity heightens stakes without gimmickry, as in the feedback loop during the transpose. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, supporting originality.</comment>
