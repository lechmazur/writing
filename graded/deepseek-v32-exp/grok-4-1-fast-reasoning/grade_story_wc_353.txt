<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation to create music in a silent world is clear and intensifies, driving his actions; interiority is concrete with embodied empathy, and his final strumming choice is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the grove's change. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the grove's "exhaling in intensely quiet afterglow"; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density increase in sensory details, and orientation is clear early with who, where, and when anchored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the alder grove and porcelain insulator constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory detail is selective and filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of creating music escalates through Elowen's agency in strumming, narrowing options under the Accumulative lens; cost is legible in the sculpture's release and grove's change, foreclosing silence with felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of empathy and silence emerges through events and images, not statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the grove's transformation, with subtext in gestures like the siskins' flutter, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is poetic and consistent, with elision (e.g., "music felt in chests, not ears") taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and propulsion, with varied sentence rhythm and no major artifacts; slight overwriting in figurative language ("symphonically minded soul conducted") doesn't harm clarity, but limits peak score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise of a tree-song sculptor in a silent world is fresh and organic; synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in lyric mode heightening stakes without gimmickry, and closure recharging prior material.</comment>
