<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority (e.g., heartbeat counting) and micro-choices (using ink patterns) that reveal her flawed survival. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in her acceptance of wisdom.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in "survival was no error, but a heartbeat's defiant song." The Accumulative lens holds, with patterns (ink, heartbeats) tightening meaning. Orientation is clear early, and the ghost's resolution charges the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective (opal observatory, snow), with sensory details that pressure choices (e.g., ink patterns under opal light). The environment constrains the defragmentation method and charges the final image of solace.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (wisdom from failure) escalate under the Accumulative lens through Elara's agency in defragmenting the ghost, with cost visible in her realization. The density increase in patterns and heartbeats reweights the dominant stake meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (porcelain shard, digital ghost) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Elara's acceptance, reweighting prior material like the death certificate error.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature (e.g., "snowflakes danced like forgotten stars"). Rhythm and diction control under pressure, and any elision (e.g., radio static) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Figurative language is purposeful (e.g., ink as nebulae), and propulsion accelerates toward the resonant ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of elements (death certificate error, digital ghost, ink patterns), transforming tropes through specific detail. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
