<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with interiority shown through embodied emotion like "quiet sobs" and analytical intuition. Her final choice to become guardian is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in tears and transformation. Contradictory impulses of rage and love act in scene, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Elara fulfills Theo's promise and becomes guardian, with felt cost in her tears and emotional resolution. The causal drive lens holds strongly, with clues linked by because/therefore logic. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraints (Theo's artistic trail) shape tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "dust and echoes" and "scent of aged wool" filtering through Elara's POV. The archive and objects (e.g., tapestry fragment) constrain choices and charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ test by altering tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescuing Theo's promise) escalates through Elara's agency under the causal lens, with one meaningful tightening as she decodes clues. Cost is unmistakable in her emotional turmoil and transformation, though escalation lacks multiple reversals, keeping it just below 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of love, loss, and preservation emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in clues and emotional beats. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer as Elara becomes guardian, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, analytical perceptual signature. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and elision (e.g., clue decoding) is taught and paid off. Slight register consistency in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with purposeful figurative language like "volcanic tenderness." Minor overwriting in dense metaphors slightly reduces clarity, but no loops or artifacts harm closure; propulsion remains strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and transformative, blending arsonist-to-guardian arc with artistic clues. Synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional specificity avoids templates.</comment>
