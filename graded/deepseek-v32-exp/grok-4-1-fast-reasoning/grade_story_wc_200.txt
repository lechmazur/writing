<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with embodied resolve, but lacks deep internal contradiction or significant flawed complexity, limiting peak emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with felt cost (Elara's lingering ache) under a causal lens; orientation is immediate, and the gorge's echoes persistently shape tactics, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Echo Gorge constrains choices and charges the final image with sensory specificity, such as mist amplifying whispers, meeting the 9+ test for environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency through harp-playing and pursuit, with cost legible in Harlan's release and her burden, under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of healing through laughter emerges organically from action and image, with the ending reweighting prior material without moralizing, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; elision (e.g., spectral confessions) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in phrases like "luminous ache" slightly reduces clarity in peak beats without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes soul-collecting with laughter-based healing in a fresh, inevitable way; risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
