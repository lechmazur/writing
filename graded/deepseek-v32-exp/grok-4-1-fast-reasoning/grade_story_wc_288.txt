<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to translate isolation into independence is clear and intensifies under pressure, driving her choice to coexist with spectral echoes. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotions, such as "brittle awakenings stirred: visions of Aelari councils." The final renunciation of solitude is earned through prior causality, with cost legible in her embracing ethereal presences. Minor abstraction in some descriptions prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with Elara achieving coexistence, cost felt in her spectral integration. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation builds through density of imagery and vibrational resonance. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the stone circle's hum persistently shapes tactics. The ending reweights options without exposition, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Tidal Library and stone circle are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail, constraining choices and charging the final image of emerging wings. Setting pressures Elara's actions, such as the mist seeping through panes deepening the hum. Micro-setting elements like the brass sundial alter tactics by revealing atomic imprints. Specificity is high, avoiding generic placement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of isolation versus independence escalates under the Accumulative lens through Elara's agency in attuning to the hum, narrowing her options. Cost is legible in her foreclosing pure solitude to embrace spectral coexistence. The hum deepens pressure, leading to a decisive shift where "coexistence bloomed, fragile yet unbreakable." One meaningful tightening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the sundial's atomic reflection reconfiguring isolation into shared independence. Subtext operates through gestures like wings tingling, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via ethereal Aelari silhouettes, reweighting prior material without statement. Emotional aftereffect lingers through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic diction and rhythmic control under pressure. Elision, like "brittle awakenings," is taught early and pays off at closure. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, as in "Isolation ends here," merging with the hum. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story through concrete action and image. Minor figurative stacking in peaks, like "atomically reflective feathers catching the sundial's gleam," slightly muddles clarity but doesn't obscure closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts; sentence-level propulsion remains strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in non-obvious synthesis of extinct species, reincarnation, and vibrational resonance, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the tidal library's ethereal tides. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure is legible with cost.</comment>
