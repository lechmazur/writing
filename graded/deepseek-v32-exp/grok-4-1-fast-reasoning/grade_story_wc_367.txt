<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and internal conflict between routine and ambition. His final choice to summon shadows is earned by the prophetic vision, demonstrating contradictory impulses in scene. The change forecloses his old path with visible cost in the reshaped world. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies weaken the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost—the world reborn in balanced shadow—under a causal drive lens that holds throughout. Elias's decision to warp the beam directly causes the outcome, with orientation anchored early. The lantern wick acts as a persistent constraint shaping tactics, and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail, and the Emerald Lighthouse and glass lantern wick function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the closure. The object's role in summoning shadows integrates setting with action, avoiding generic description. Tone consistently supports the shadowed elation atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elias's desire to shape a new dawn—escalates through his agency under the causal lens, driven by the prophetic vision. His decision to steer shadows narrows options and imposes cost, with the climax showing a visible trade-off in the draped coast. Escalation is coherent and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from events, exploring change vs. tradition through the lens of ancient shadows reshaping humanity. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in the balanced shadow world, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates through visions and actions, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature in Elias's mystical, elated voice. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and purposeful compression (e.g., the prophetic flicker) pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register shifts disrupt coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic but maintains clarity and propulsion, with high information density and varied syntax. Minor overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "shadowed elation") does not obscure cause/effect or closure. No loops, scaffold, or artifact issues harm momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar elements (lighthouse herald, prophetic objects) into a fresh, inevitable whole through specific character choices and world logic. Risk-taking in tone and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure reconfigures meaning with originality. No derivative premises or echoes weaken impact.</comment>
