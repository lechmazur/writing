<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to discover time's texture is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices (e.g., pressing the halo fragment) revealing internal conflict. His final renunciation of the retrocognitive trap is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the disintegration. Contradictory impulses act in scene, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as the halo fragment disintegrates, shattering the trap and freeing Elias, under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The persistent constraint of retrocognitive visions shapes tactics, and cost is legible in the "fragment's demise scattered the fading photographs' spectral hold."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The living bridge garden constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory detail (e.g., "vines wove into swaying spans") integrated into action. Environment pressures Elias's use of hyperbolic geometry, and the setting's evolution mirrors his inner state, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the Accumulative lens, as he uses the halo fragment to invoke hyperbolic geometry, leading to disintegration with unmistakable cost. The dominant stake of discovering time's texture tightens through this action, foreclosing options and reweighting the premise with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images and events, such as the fading photographs and hyperbolic paths, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to time's texture through the final image of Elias feeling "time's texture ripple through his skin," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful compression and elision (e.g., "were they eons?") are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; voice coherence enhances the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful, though slightly dense in peaks, but coherence remains. Satisfies the 9+ quick test with zero figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The core premise synthesizes hedge maze design, hyperbolic geometry, and time perception in a fresh, non-obvious way. Risk-taking in dense, lyrical prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable from established particulars. Transformation of tropes through specific detail.</comment>
