<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies through trauma responses; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., proprioception mapping bark ridges). Contradictory impulses act in scene, and her final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as she rises "rooted yet free," a Resonant Reconfiguration under a Hybrid lens; orientation is clear early, and causality holds through trauma-induced revelations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest constrains choices and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, with the tree and roots actively shaping Elara's actions and realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency through trauma responses, narrowing options and changing knowledge; cost is legible in her physical and emotional pain, under the Hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mercy as fractal convergence emerges through events and images, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, with rhythmic control under pressure and no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high density and propulsion with no loops; minor risk of overwriting in peak beats, but clarity remains, and figurative language serves the story's tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and synthesized with specificity; risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
