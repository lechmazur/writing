<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The coachman's motivation to distill complexity is clear and intensifies, with embodied interiority and micro-choices like mending the tapestry. His final realization earns the change, though minor passivity in reflection slightly limits agency. The cost of foreclosing tangled oaths is felt in the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as the coachman understands the essence of his duty, with cost legible in the final image. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, supported by persistent fog and rain constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with fog-bound river and rain gutters constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory details are POV-filtered and integrated into action, such as the needle and tapestry acting as micro-settings that mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to distill complexity escalates under accumulative lens through the coachman's agency in mending and reflection, leading to a cost legible in the foreclosed path of tangled vows. Pressure coheres with one meaningful tightening that reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the palimpsest promise and actions, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to fidelity and legacy without moralizing. Subtext operates through imagery like the needle and fog, and the ending reweights prior material with complexity distilled into essence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control, evident in poetic prose and selective attention. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats, and propulsion supports the accumulative drive. No scaffold or register drift harms clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of palimpsest promise and coachman lore, with specific details that feel inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the concept transforms familiar tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
