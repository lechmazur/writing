<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Elias becomes visible, fulfilling his vow with emotional cost.

<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like "sapphire hush" and "ferric tang," constraining choices and charging the final image.

<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of visibility escalates through Elias's agency, driven by the woman's despair and his memory.

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of visibility and connection emerges through events and images, not direct statement.

<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Elias, with a distinct poetic voice that modulates under pressure.
