<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is vivid with embodied emotions and contradictory impulses (solemn playfulness); her motivation to discover truths intensifies under pressure, driving key choices like the proof by contradiction, and her final resolution is earned with visible cost in Thorne's regret.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (Thorne's confession and Elara's redemption vow) and felt cost under the causal lens; orientation is clear early, and because/therefore linkages tighten options, with the rosewood pen nib shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The observatory setting pressures choices through sensory details (echoing dome, wind) and constrains the confrontation; the pen nib as micro-setting charges the final image by enabling revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth about legacy) escalates through Elara's agency in logical proof, forcing Thorne's confession with cost legible in his defeat; one meaningful tightening narrows options under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of orbits of regret emerges through particulars like stellar imagery and Elara's regrets, offering a resonant, non-literal answer at closure without moralizing; subtext operates in dialogue and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (poetic, observant); dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit, and voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and high information density without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "orbits of regret" is coherent and purposeful, supporting clarity and momentum in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of newsprint empire with astronomical motifs feels inevitable; risk-taking in logical proof method heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
