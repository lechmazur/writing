<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's internal conflict is concretely embodied and her motivation to provoke change is clear, driving her decisive action. The shift from "bravely conflicted" to resolved feels earned through prior causality, with cost implied by the impending scandal. Contradictory impulses act in scene, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (sending the letter awakens networks) and felt cost (alarms, Regime scramble). Causal lens holds tightly from glitch to action, and the frozen library's constraint shapes tactics. Orientation is anchored early, and cost is legible in the final beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices—the frozen library and pods pressure Elara's actions. Sensory details like "frost-rimed controls" are purposeful, and the environment charges the final image as the "dizzying quiet" becomes alive with potential, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (freedom vs. control) escalate through Elara's agency under the causal lens, from internal conflict to transmitting the letter. Cost is unmistakable in the scandal and network awakening. One meaningful tightening forecloses her prior indecision with visible risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of contraband truths and silent revolution emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through "revolution in murmurs," reweighting prior material without moralizing, and subtext thrives in the unspoken conversation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature ("dizzying quiet," "digital whisper"). Rhythmic control under pressure and purposeful elision (e.g., time stretch) are taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, but minor repetition of "dizzying quiet" and "bravely conflicted" creates slight rhythmic monotony. No major artifacts obscure causality; propulsion remains strong through peak beats, and closure is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes cryogenic archives and silent rebellion with freshness, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the unspoken conversation concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and specific details (e.g., neural webs) avoid template plots.</comment>
