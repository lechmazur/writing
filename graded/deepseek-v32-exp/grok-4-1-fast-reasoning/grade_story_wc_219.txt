<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in academic rebellion and skepticism, driving her choices like leaving her post and converging at the tower. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion (e.g., "luminous skepticism cast a soft glow"), and micro-choices under pressure reveal her values. The final renunciation of mere destination for convergence is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the transformed understanding of homecoming.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strong, with events linked by because/therefore logic (e.g., Elara's scans lead to pilgrimage, convergence activates amber). Closure is a conceptual repricing (CR) where homecoming is redefined as convergence, with cost legible in the "chemical harmony" dissolving doubt. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the tower's activation pays off established set-ups without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details like "rainwashed stone" and "bronze quiet" filtering through Elara's POV. The fly amber and tower constrain choices and charge the final image, as the amber's activation reweights the stakes. Spatial choreography is coherent, with the path and footprints guiding action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding homecoming escalates under causal lens, tightening with Elara's pilgrimage and the convergence at the tower. Protagonist agency drives the climax (placing the amber on the plinth), foreclosing prior options with cost visible in the "luminous skeptic's final doubt dissolving." No coincidence resolves; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of homecoming as convergence emerges organically from events and images (e.g., footprints, amber's chemistry), not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "chemistry clicked" realization, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, like the amber's "longing" signals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature ("bronze quiet spring") and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven when present (e.g., Kai and Mira's lines). Purposeful compression in lyric mode is taught and paid off at closure, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("petals clung like forgotten whispers") is coherent and supports atmosphere. No artifacts obscure causality; closure image is sharp with "bronze quiet enveloped them." Minor overwriting is harmless to clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of alien contact with homecoming chemistry, transformed through specific details like the fly amber's signals. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with closure reconfiguring meaning authentically.</comment>
