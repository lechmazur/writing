<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. Her persistence and the community's intergenerational arcs are earned, though minor stereotypical elements in secondary characters prevent a higher score. The final choice to formalize the Shadow Harvest is motivated by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal drive holds strong with clear linkage from sanctions to community action. Closure is a decisive change (Shadow Harvest covenant) with felt cost in enduring sanctions but building legacy. Orientation is anchored early, and the lens remains coherent without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the terra-cotta arbor and ridge constraining choices (e.g., sanctuary for meetings, shadowed paths for runs). The antique silver bell recurs and charges the final image, enhancing atmosphere without ornamental detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes of survival and community spirit escalate through Mira's agency, from receiving donations to organized runs facing enforcer risks. Cost is legible in narrowed options and strengthened bonds, driven by protagonist choices under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocity and resilience emerges through actions like anonymous donations and midnight runs, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with complexity, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, e.g., "amplified quiet." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, and elision (e.g., shadowed runs) is taught and pays off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with good rhythm and information density, though minor overwriting (e.g., "threads of forgotten hope") slightly reduces clarity. No major artifacts or loops; sentence-level propulsion supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Concept of anonymous donations in a sanctions context offers a fresh synthesis, transformed through specific community details. Emotional truth in resilience elevates it, but it lacks groundbreaking risk-taking for a higher score.</comment>
