<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to preserve lost songs and later build trust with Lila is clear and intensifies, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as his frantic mapping after Lila's accusation. His internal conflict between reinvention and honesty is dramatized in scene, and the final confession is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with cost when Elias confesses and they balance the chip permanently; causal lens holds throughout with orientation anchored early. The balance constraint shapes tactics, and cost is legible in his trembling hand and the reintegration of trust.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The attic setting constrains choices through dust motes and skylight, charging the final image of eternal balance; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's POV, with the environment mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving songs and building trust escalates through Elias's agency, culminating in his confession; cost is legible in the trade-off of honesty for reconciliation, with one meaningful tightening that forecloses options under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Themes of trust and reinvention emerge through events and images, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the balanced chip and shared songs, with subtext in gestures like Lila steadying his hand.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet consistent, modulating under pressure without head-hopping. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present, as in Lila's accusation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent even in peak beats, and sentence rhythm varies naturally, though slightly dense diction does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific choices; risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure reweights prior material with emotional specificity.</comment>
