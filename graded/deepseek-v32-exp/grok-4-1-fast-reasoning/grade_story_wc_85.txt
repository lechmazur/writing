<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's guilt is concretely embodied and drives micro-choices like sifting driftwood; his final renunciation of deception is earned by causal discoveries, with cost legible in "tempered regret lingered, not as torment, but as a quiet vow." Contradictory impulses act in scene, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in the vow to rebuild genuine lines; causal lens holds tightly from guilt-driven shore visit to revelatory driftwood finds. Orientation is anchored early, and persistent constraint of withheld truth shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shore and driftwood carvings function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory details like "brine and decay" are selective and POV-filtered. The watch hand's reprise as a truth-burden symbol elevates specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under causal lens—sifting driftwood narrows options and deepens stakes; cost is unmistakable when discoveries "settled—not crushing, but profound." Dominant stake of truth vs. deception tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth's weight emerges through particulars like the watch hand and carvings, avoiding moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Elias's resolve. Subtext operates in images like the noose beneath varnish.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with lyrical perceptual signature ("sieved hush"); compression like "tempered regret" is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; elision anchors in concrete cues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, though minor purple hints ("bones of drowned ships") slightly dilute peak beats. No loops or scaffold artifacts; propulsion remains clear to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise of black market genealogist is fresh and transformed through specific details; turns feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical synthesis heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure reweights prior material.</comment>
