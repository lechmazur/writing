<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is vivid with concrete interiority and embodied emotions; her ambition and olfactory sensitivity drive consistent micro-choices under pressure, and her transformation to harmony is earned through the corpse flower's assault, with cost legible in her physical collapse. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as gagging yet breathing deep to doodle, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—Elara's collapse and wisdom gain—under the Accumulative lens, which holds throughout; orientation is clear early, and the tide's thought motif tightens causality without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (e.g., pots swinging in gales) and charges the final image with the bloom's majesty; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, particularly olfactory, fulfilling the 9+ test by altering tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the Accumulative lens, from planting the seed to enduring the stench, with cost unmistakable in her physical torment and realization; the dominant stake of serenity within motion tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of serenity in impermanence emerges organically from particulars like the flower's decay and village sway, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end; no moralizing, and wisdom is earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice has a distinct perceptual signature focused on smell and motion, with rhythmic control under pressure; POV is stable and single, though slight overwriting in dense metaphors prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and purposeful with varied rhythm, but occasional dense figurative language in peak beats (e.g., "odor a tidal wave crashing her awareness") causes minor muddle, though clarity and momentum are maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of olfactory focus, corpse flower lore, and treetop setting, feeling inevitable and risk-taking; the concept transforms familiar themes through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
