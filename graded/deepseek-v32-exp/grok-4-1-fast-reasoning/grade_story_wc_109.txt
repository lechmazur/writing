<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Oracle's mild obsession is consistently embodied and drives key choices, but Elara's characterization remains reactive and underdeveloped, lacking interior contradiction or micro-choices that reveal depth under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara clutches the map fragment, cost legible in the "ambered silence sealed their pact"; accumulative/textural lens holds tightly with causality intact from oracle's method to map creation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting vividly constrains choice—the ridge fort's quiet enables summarizing silence, and the flaking booklet charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate meaningfully under accumulative lens through oracle's agency in summarizing silence, leading to map fragment with cost felt in the lone star's fading; one tightening forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from retelling silence to map oblivion, with subtext in gestures and final image offering non-literal resonance; no moralizing, earned through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is consistently poetic with stable POV (limited third); perceptual signature distinct in oracle's obsession, though Elara's perspective blends at peaks; dialogue natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats like "summarizing silence."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and transformative—mapping endless night through summarized silence—with risk-taking in lyric style that heightens stakes without gimmickry; synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
