<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in past mistakes, driving her to recycle errors into wisdom. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as tracing the drawer pull. The final choice to give the pull to Kael is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in her freed conscience. Contradictory impulses act in scene, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change: prisoners are freed and the drawer pull is exchanged, symbolizing peace under a causal lens. Cost is legible in Elara's conscience and the symbolic act. The persistent constraint of past deception shapes tactics, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The storm-worn parapet and mist create atmospheric pressure that influences choices. The antique drawer pull functions as a micro-setting object that constrains decisions and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, reflecting POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of personal and clan peace escalates through Elara's agency, such as initiating the exchange and symbolic gesture. Cost is unmistakable in the emotional release and giving of the drawer pull. Under the causal lens, tightening occurs with moon phase synchronization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of recycling mistakes into wisdom emerges through events and symbols, not direct statement.

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Elara's thoughtful, poetic voice. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, advancing plot with subtext. No head-hopping; rhythmic control under pressure is evident.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has varied rhythm and high information density without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language serves atmosphere without muddle in peak beats. Minor overwriting exists but does not harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of prisoner exchange with symbolic objects and moon phases.
