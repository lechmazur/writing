<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to honor overlooked histories is clear and consistent, driving her actions like building ephemeral structures. Her interiority is concrete, with micro-choices under pressure, such as knot-tying, revealing her values. However, some abstract phrasing in peak beats slightly dulls embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as structures dissolve, reconfiguring meaning with cost legible in the wing's flight. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of transience pays off at closure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposeful, constraining choices (e.g., vines from grotto walls used for structures) and charging the final image. The grotto's "blushing stillness" evolves with the action, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of honoring histories escalates through Elara's agency in building towers, with cost felt in their dissolution. Under Accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, foreclosing options through transience, though one tightening is sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transience and memory emerges through particulars like knot unravelling and wing signals, offering a resonant, non-literal answer at closure. Subtext in gestures avoids moralizing, with complexity in overlooked histories.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; poetic voice controls rhythm under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., "transiently rooted") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, advancing story without loops. Minor overwriting in figurative language ("Morse of light") slightly muddles peak beats, but clarity and propulsion remain strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of esoteric realism and ephemeral structures feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style heightening stakes. Specific details like moth wing and knots transform familiar tropes through character-driven choices.</comment>
