<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias and Lila exhibit contradictory impulses (persistence vs. feistiness) that drive on-page choices; Lila's shift from skepticism to acceptance is earned through the bag's discovery and storm crisis, with cost legible in her saving Elias and redefining vows. Emotional embodiment avoids diagnostic labels, though Lila's initial return motivation ("dying visions") feels slightly external.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from Elias's climb to bag discovery triggering Lila's return, culminating in heart-tree mending as decisive change; orientation anchored by ~100 words ("abandoned cathedral," "Elias," "daily climb"). Closure cost is felt in Lila's ribbon-tying and voiced realization ("roots that regrow"), with persistent constraint of broken vows shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cathedral orchard micro-setting constrains key choices (rotted beam risk, climbing to rafters) and charges the final image via heart-tree quartz; sensory detail (dripping sap, cracked pews) is filtered through Elias's priorities. Spatial choreography remains clear during storm sequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mending relational and wisdom breach) escalates through agency: Lila's return narrows options, storm forces life-saving shove, and heart-tree repair demands joint effort. Cost is unmistakable in Lila's feistiness yielding to "roots that regrow" amid swirling leaves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of generational renewal emerges through deciduous vows and heart-tree imagery, not statement; subtext operates in Lila's ribbon-tying and saved push. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer ("roots that regrow"), though Lila's dialogue slightly moralizes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with Elias's perceptual signature (quartz-eye glimpses); dialogue natural and goal-driven (Lila's snap "madness"). Voice maintains poetic consistency under pressure, and elision (e.g., breach backstory) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control ("fruit gleamed brighter, wisdom bridged"); no loops or scaffold artifacts. Minor overwriting in peak beats ("visions cascading: not grand prophecies...") slightly slows momentum but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of quartz-eye mender, cathedral orchard, and deciduous vows feels inevitable; tropes transformed through specific lived detail (ribbon scent, forgotten bag). Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
