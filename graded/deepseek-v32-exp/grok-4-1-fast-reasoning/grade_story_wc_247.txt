<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Finn's internal conflict and transformation are earned through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as his mesmerized response to Elara. Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies stakes, though her backstory remains lightly sketched. The final choice to disrupt the festival is credible and costs his isolation, rekindling purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in the festival's dissolution into harmonious quiet and Finn's reclaimed purpose, under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the mapping silence pattern teaches and pays off. Persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting details like the "luminous harbor" and "moored boats swaying" are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Finn's POV to mirror internal states. The harbor and camera constrain choices by framing silence, charging the final image with unspoken grief.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens, from mapping silence to disrupting the festival, with cost legible in the crowd's tears and Finn's transformation. The dominant stake of translating silence tightens through a meaningful deepening that reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like sign language and the camera, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to silence and memory without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and imagery, such as Elara's whispers syncing with signs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic texture, e.g., "melodies from youth evaporated like morning mist." Dialogue and signs are economical and goal-driven, with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Minor overwriting in phrases like "joyful sorrow infected him" slightly muddles peak beats, but clarity and propulsion remain strong, especially in the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes silence mapping and sign language into a fresh, non-obvious angle on music and memory. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
