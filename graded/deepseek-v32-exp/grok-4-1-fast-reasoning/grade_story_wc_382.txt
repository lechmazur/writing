<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to decipher the building whispers is clear and intensifies, driving her to confront Harlan; her interiority is concrete, and their relationship under pressure forces choices that alter their dynamic. Harlan's nuanced portrayal and their agreed-upon lies add depth, though his patience could be more conflicted under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot builds causally from initial meeting to rooftop climax, with closure as a decisive change where Elara speaks the language and lies dissolve; cost is legible in Harlan's admission and the seal's transfer, and the causal lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, from the whispering Victorian to the meteor-lit rooftop garden, which constrains choices by forcing the confrontation; sensory details like warped floorboards and jasmine trellises are integrated with action and POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes around learning the language escalate through Elara's agency, culminating in her interrogation that narrows options and reveals truths; cost is felt in Harlan's facade wavering and the seal's pivotal role, under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths and dormant language emerges through events and subtext in their lies, not direct statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer as Elara speaks the building's tongue, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single POV from Elara is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending poetic observation with urgency; dialogue carries subtext and advances plot, though some phrases edge toward purple prose without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in metaphoric language (e.g., "stars plummeting like revelations") slightly muddles peak beats; no major artifacts or loops, and closure remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Concept of whispering buildings and dead language tutor feels fresh and specific, transformed through grounded character choices; the rooftop revelation and seal use are earned risks that heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
