<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to salvage purity is clear and drives her choices, with concrete interiority shown through actions like tracing the globe. However, contradictory impulses are not deeply explored, and emotional embodiment occasionally leans abstract, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the exposure of the mate's treachery and retrieval of the locket, costing the ghosts' peace under a causal lens. Orientation is immediate, and causality tightens through the ritual and cameo analysis, with cost legible in "ghosts sighed into peace."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ice shrine and melted snow globe are vividly specific, constraining Elara's choices and charging the final image with the globe's reformation. Sensory details like "candle flames danced like captured constellations" are purposeful and filtered through her POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes to salvage purity escalate through Elara's agency in analyzing cameos, leading to a tightening choice to expose the mate with cost in the ghosts' release. Under the causal lens, pressure coheres without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of purity amidst betrayal emerges through images like the child's locket, offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in ghost cameos, but occasional near-statement like "purity endured" slightly reduces ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a lyrical, perceptual signature evident in phrases like "breath fogging the air like borrowed starlight." Rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping, and elision in dream sequences is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density, but minor overwriting occurs in stacked metaphors like "windows of connection between the living and the lost." No loops or scaffold obscure closure, and propulsion remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes ghost whispering and dream analysis uniquely, with turns feeling inevitable through character choice. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity avoids template plots.</comment>
