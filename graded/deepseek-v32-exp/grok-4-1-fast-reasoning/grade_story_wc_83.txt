<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is deeply rooted in her trauma, with embodied emotion like scars burning with memories. Her final choice to become "sovereign of the unseen" is earned by prior causality, though minor stock phrasing ("ghosts from that blood-soaked altar") slightly limits interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara seals the crystal, changing from survivor to sovereign with felt cost. Causal lens holds strong, driven by her past and experiments, and orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the floating observatory and geode crystal constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "dim hum" and "recycled air" are purposeful and filtered through Elara's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency in hunting and perturbing, leading to a decisive tightening as she claims the pool's power. Cost is legible when she seals the crystal, foreclosing other paths with exhilaration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of awakening and potential emerges organically from Elara's journey, with subtext in her trauma. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though it leans slightly on abstract exhilaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and rhythmic control under pressure. Minimal dialogue ("Perturb it") is natural and goal-driven, and elision (e.g., perturbation theory) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with high information density and varied syntax. Minor overwriting ("intangibly tangible" repetition) and figurative density in peak beats cause slight muddle, but no major loops or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (drone strike survivor, geode crystal) feels inevitable, with fresh angle on trauma and potential. Risk-taking in poetic language heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
