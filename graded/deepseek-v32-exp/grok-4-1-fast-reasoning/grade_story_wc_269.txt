<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his witness of coral bleaching, with embodied interiority shown through tapping rhythms and data assembly. Micro-choices under pressure reveal his values, and his final broadcast is earned by prior causality. Minor lack of deep internal conflict prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Elias's realization reconfigures meaning from loss to hope, under a coherent accumulative lens. Orientation is clear early, and causality tightens from motivation to revelation. The broadcast decisively changes his stance with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral, with the monitoring station and ocean constraining choices like data assembly. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, mirroring internal states. The atlas page and tools charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency in assembling data, under the accumulative lens, leading to a revelation that reweights stakes. Cost is legible in his emotional shift and broadcast. One meaningful tightening forecloses isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the atlas page and tapping rhythms, offering a resonant answer on cyclic change without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, and the ending reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in rhythmic prose and selective attention. Voice modulates with pressure, and elision (e.g., past witness) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and clarity, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No major artifacts or loops; figurative language serves purpose. Minor density in peaks prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of climate change and hope, with specific details like tapping rhythms and coral core samples transforming familiar tropes. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
