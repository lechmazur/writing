<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying as he writes obituaries to heal his own wounds. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure, such as lifting the thread to his lips, revealing character. The final change—feeling whole—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his tears and realization about his sister's absence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias reborn, feeling whole) under an accumulative/textural lens, with felt cost in his emotional release. The drive lens holds throughout, with the thread and obituaries building pattern and meaning. Orientation is clear early, and the structure is coherent for the length, with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The shadowed garden constrains choices and charges the final image, with the thread found there shaping Elias's actions. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, like "scent of damp soil and fading jasmine," filtered through POV. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the accumulative lens, as each obituary deepens his understanding and narrows options for healing. The dominant stake (internal conflict and healing) tightens with visible cost in his tears and the mapping of wounds. Pressure coheres through the thread's projections, leading to a decisive change.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of absences and healing emerges through events and images, not direct statement, with subtext in the thread and obituaries. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Elias's rebirth, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Complexity is embraced, with plausible ambiguity in the geographies of healing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and close to Elias, with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, selective observation. Voice is consistent and rhythmically controlled, even under pressure, with no head-hopping. Experimental elements like patterned elision are taught and legible, supporting closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and purposeful, with good rhythm and information density, though minor overwriting occurs (e.g., "crimson as arterial blood yet soft as a lover's sigh"). No major artifacts or loops obscure causality; closure remains clear. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The concept of writing obituaries for the living with a magical thread is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific details, and risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
