<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Thorne's motivation to preserve the dying language is clear and intensifies under pressure, driving key choices like using the flawed diamond. His copper veins pulsing with tales provide embodied interiority, and his final action is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The quietly articulate trait constrains his approach, adding depth without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost: the diamond transforms, preserving the language's textures eternally. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory patterns. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the dying language shapes tactics, with cost legible in "the diamond drank it in... crystallizing texture into sound."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with bone towers and the tunnel of echoes constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "grit of sand" and "velvet hush" are filtered through Thorne's POV, integrating into action. The environment actively shapes the climax, making it indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving the language escalates through Thorne's agency, harnessing the flock's patterns to modulate echoes. Under the accumulative lens, density increases with pattern breaks, and cost is unmistakable in the risk of the curse bending to purpose. The climax is driven by protagonist choice, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of cultural preservation through imperfection emerges organically from events, with subtext in the flawed diamond mirroring the dying language. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "the old language reborn—not spoken, but felt through sound," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; Thorne's quietly articulate voice modulates under pressure with poetic prose. No head-hopping, and purposeful compression (e.g., "years blurred") is taught and paid off. The narrative stance remains consistent, enhancing emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language like "towers of bone thrust skyward" is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the climax, maintaining clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of echoes, a flawed diamond, and bird patterns to preserve a language feels inevitable and transformative. Risk-taking with poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the core premise is fresh, grounded in specific details like "zhar'keth" evoking texture.</comment>
