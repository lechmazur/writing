<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in loss, with embodied emotion shown through scars and tears. His micro-choices under pressure, like building the signal, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final action to light the beacon is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his tears and mended heart.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively as Elias lights the beacon, triggering return migrations, with felt cost in his tears. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through descriptive layers to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early, and causality is strong, with each step driven by his actions and cryptic calls.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the starlit signal station and censer foot constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, such as the censer's hum guiding construction. The environment pressures tactics and resources, enhancing coherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of guiding lost ones home escalates through Elias's agency under the accumulative lens, from building to lighting the signal. Cost is legible in his physical effort and emotional release. The tightening forecloses other paths, with the beacon's success reweighting options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of reverse migration and navigating loss emerges organically from events and images, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the signal's success, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in cryptic calls and rituals, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic, rhythmic prose. Dialogue from calls feels natural and advances plot. No head-hopping; voice coherence under pressure, with elision taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing atmosphere without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative build, and clarity is maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in fresh synthesis of patchwork navigator, reverse migration, and cryptic calls, transformed through specific details. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth and inevitability in hindsight elevate the piece.</comment>
