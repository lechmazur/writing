<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to solve engineering puzzles with hope. Her interiority is concrete, shown through sketches and functional creativity, and her final action of resurrecting the terminal is earned by prior causality. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; micro-choices under pressure reveal her values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly with clear because/therefore linkages from finding the sextant to redirecting flows. Closure is a decisive change with cost legible in the resonator's awakening and quantified hope. Orientation is anchored early, and the maze's constraints shape tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like cracked ferrocrete and shattered viewports, constraining choices as a maze and charging the final image of the humming terminal. POV-filtered description integrates with action, and spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens, from mapping flows to resurrecting the resonator, with cost visible in her effort and the terminal's transformation. Stakes are clear early and tighten meaningfully through her redirected intentions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of hope through engineering emerges implicitly from events and images, like the sextant and redirected flows, without moralizing. The final hologram path offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting decay into possibility with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature blending poetic and functional tones, reflecting Elara's engineer mindset. No head-hopping; voice modulates with pressure, and elision is purposeful, taught early in the maze description.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive with high information density, varying rhythm and sentence structures. No loops or scaffold issues; figurative language like "maze of intentions" is coherent and supports closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of civil engineer in abandoned spaceport with sextant-based navigation feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific choices, and risk-taking in lyrical engineering concepts heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
