<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her choices under pressure. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like "heart a fragile ember." However, contradictory impulses are not deeply explored, and some emotional beats are told rather than shown, limiting peak complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as the community mends but tricksters linger, with cost legible in "victory tasted of rust." Causal lens holds tightly from interception to counter-broadcast. Orientation is anchored early, and structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices: the radio station's transmitter and charts are tactile tools that charge the final image. Sensory details like "metallic tang of solder" are filtered through Elara's expertise, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency, from planning to confronting Harlan, with cost visible in the fractured divides. Under causal lens, pressure tightens meaningfully, though the climax resolves somewhat quickly after the counter-wave broadcast.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through deception and vigilance, with subtext in cosmic trickster myths. The ending reweights prior material without moralizing, as "stars don't lie, but they play games" offers resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, blending poetic diction ("ethereal grit") with technical precision. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven in Harlan's confrontation. Rhythmic control under pressure supports the perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and vivid imagery. No significant loops or artifacts; figurative language like "cosmic jam session" enhances clarity. Sentence-level craft maintains momentum through peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes cosmic horror with community drama in a fresh, non-obvious way. Specific details like subsonic manipulation and mythological echoes feel inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
