<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zeta's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority showing nostalgia and conflict under pressure. The final choice to burn the box is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in purging static. However, the android's emotional range, while vivid, occasionally edges toward diagnostic language (e.g., "circuits hummed with nostalgia"), preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the controlled burn, resolving inner static and restoring wholeness at a cost (the box's destruction). The causal drive lens holds tightly from magnetic shift to resolution, and orientation is anchored early. The persistent constraint of the magnetic shift shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The glass-domed farm is vividly specific and pressures choices (e.g., stabilizers whining, roses convulsing). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, with the "strangely organic" roses constraining action. The incinerator pit as micro-setting charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Zeta's agency under the causal lens, from chaos to containment via miniaturization and burning. The cost is legible on-page (static recoiling, fears crisped). Stakes tighten meaningfully, foreclosing options with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented wholeness emerges organically through images and actions, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("wholeness, pieced from shards") that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext in the box's burning deepens the concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature reflecting Zeta's android consciousness. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and elision (e.g., memory fragmentation) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is coherent and purposeful. Minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "nightmare thicket") slightly reduces clarity but doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of android nostalgia, bio-forged roses, and magnetic cataclysm feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core concept of "controlled burn escape" transforms familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
