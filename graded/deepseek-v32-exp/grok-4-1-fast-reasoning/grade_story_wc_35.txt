<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elaris's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion like trembling hands. His internal conflict between remorse and healing drives micro-choices, and the final change is earned by prior causality with visible cost when he endures contagious sorrow. The resolution forecloses his past path with felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly from rain to pavilion discovery and subsumption, with orientation anchored early. Closure is a decisive change as Elaris returns transformed, cost legible in his endurance of remorse and the pavilion's thawing. The ending reconfigures his stance with undeniable cost, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—desert fortress, rain-slicked walls, coral pavilion—and constrains choices by forcing Elaris to dig and work in the icy environment. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through his POV, with the pavilion charging the final image of thawing and healing. The quick test is passed as the environment shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of healing remorse escalates under causal lens through Elaris's agency in digging and subsuming, with cost legible as he gasps under remorse's weight. One meaningful tightening occurs when he chooses to subsume, foreclosing other options and altering his state. The quick test is met with agency-driven escalation and on-page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and remorse emerges organically from events like tasting the water and subsuming, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "memories polished to a sturdy, unbrittle sheen," reweighting prior material. No moralizing or thematic echo, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, using poetic but consistent diction that reflects Elaris's chef background. No head-hopping; voice modulates under pressure, such as when remorse "flooded him," without obscuring clarity. The quick test is passed with rhythmic control and taught elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, but minor overwriting appears in phrases like "sturdy brittle reality," causing slight register drift. No loops or scaffold artifacts; rhythm varies naturally, and closure remains clear. Deduction for figurative density in peak beats without major harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes memory-tasting, coral pavilion, and remorse subsumption with freshness, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specific details anchor universals. The quick test is met with non-obvious synthesis and bold choices.</comment>
