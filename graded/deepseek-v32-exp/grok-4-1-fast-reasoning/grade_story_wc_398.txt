<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elena's embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are strong, with credible endurance earned through causality. Theo's motivation is clear and roots the relationship crucible. Minor overwriting in peak beats slightly dampens impact, but closure choice is motivated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Elena's release. Accumulative/textural lens holds, tightening through dialogue parallels. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the final image reweights options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the amber pavilion constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are filtered through POV, and environmental mirroring of internal states avoids cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in Elena's realization. The stake in her relationship conflict deepens through Theo's parallels, foreclosing an option with visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of destined mismatches emerges organically through particulars, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext operates in gesture and image, avoiding moralizing while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot, and purposeful elision in reflection is paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with varied rhythm and clear propulsion. Minor overwriting and figurative stacking in high-pressure beats cause slight muddle, but no loops or artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept of mismatches is transformed through specific character choices, with emotional specificity and risk-taking in the quiet resolution. Synthesis feels inevitable, and freshness arises from grounded details.</comment>
