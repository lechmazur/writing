<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and personal, driving her choices, but emotions are occasionally told rather than shown (e.g., "her motivation burned hotter"), slightly reducing embodied interiority. Micro-choices under pressure, like navigating by water flow and prying the arrow tip, reveal values and cost. The final decision to take the artifact is earned by her backstory and discovery, with visible cost on page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost: taking the arrow tip causes echoes to wail and vines retract, and she uses it to revive her groves. Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages. Orientation is anchored early; gravity inversion as a persistent constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with floating arches and inverted gravity constraining choices (e.g., navigation by water flow). The arrow tip as a micro-setting object charges the final image when planted. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding resilience source) escalates through Elara's agency under causal lens, from entering the cavern to taking the arrow tip. Cost is legible when echoes wail and vines retract. One meaningful tightening narrows options and forces a trade-off, charging the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of resilience and sacrifice emerges organically from events, with subtext in echoes as planetary memory. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through her action of planting the tip, reweighting prior material without moralizing. No explicit thematic statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "whirling silence" and "liquid starlight." Voice is poetic but consistent, and elision (e.g., gravity inversion mechanics) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "vibrant wisps of sound made visible") slightly reduces clarity. No loops or scaffolds; sentence-level propulsion advances story effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes unique elements (orchard planet, gravity inversion, echoes) with non-obvious ingenuity. Tropes are transformed through specific details and character-driven stakes. Risk-taking with inverted gravity and planetary memory heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
