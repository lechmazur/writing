<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as a cast lots decision maker, with interiority shown through concrete actions like tracing coins and distilling bursts. Her quiet enthusiasm is a steady pulse against stellar doubt, and her final choice to broadcast the prophecy is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in risking dissolution. The resolution forecloses a path with felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is achieved with a decisive change as Elara broadcasts the prophecy, causing the universe to stir, under a causal lens held throughout. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible in the trembling doubt and newborn purpose. The backwards prophecy shapes tactics, and the ending reconfigures options with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The amber observatory deck and foreign coins constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like eternal amber glow and humming coins integrated into action. Setting pressures Elara's decisions, and the micro-setting of the deck and coins alters tactics, meeting the 9+ test by shaping the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of aligning with cosmic purpose escalates under the causal lens through Elara's agency in casting lots and distilling bursts, narrowing options with each decision. Cost is visible in visions of failed peers and the universe's stirring, and the climax forces a trade-off with felt price, driving escalation through protagonist choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of doubt and purpose emerges through the backwards prophecy and static bursts, with subtext in cosmic struggle. The ending offers a non-literal answer through broadcasting the prophecy, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from Elara's specific experience, and resonance lingers with meaningful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, using poetic diction and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice remains consistent, and elision in static bursts is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping, and the narrative stance effectively reflects Elara's focused urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with purposeful figurative language like "ambered observatory deck" and "stellar doubt." No loops or scaffolds obscure causality, and closure is clear. Minor overwriting in dense metaphors does not harm peak beats, but prevents a higher score due to slight density in high-pressure sections.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The backwards prophecy in a contracted universe offers a fresh synthesis, transforming tropes through specific details like coin casting and static bursts. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with emotional truth in Elara's struggle against doubt.</comment>
