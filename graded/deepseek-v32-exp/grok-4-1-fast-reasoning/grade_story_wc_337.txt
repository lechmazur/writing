<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lirien's motivation is clear and rooted in personal history, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final endurance shows cost, though internal contradiction could be more pronounced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration and felt cost ("lucid unrest lingered in his heart"). The accumulative/textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details filter through POV; the prism sanctuary and net constrain choices and charge the final image with palpable atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lirien's agency in unraveling knots, with visible cost ("unrest crested") under the accumulative lens. Dominant stake tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from restoration and silence, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through image and action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control. Dialogue is minimal but natural; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and clear in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of concepts like interlaced hush and mask restoration, with risk-taking in poetic style that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
