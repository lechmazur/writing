<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and intensifies, with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure; her preemptive nostalgia and doubt create contradictory impulses, and the earned endurance at closure has visible cost in identity questioning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost in her remaking; accumulative/textural lens holds strong; orientation is clear early; shadows as persistent constraint shape tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details filtering through POV; shadows and monuments constrain choices and charge the closure, acting as micro-setting that pressures decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency through shadow examinations, tightening understanding under accumulative lens; cost is legible in trembling and doubt, but internal focus slightly limits peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of identity from collective memory emerges organically through images and events; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though minor explicit echoes in "sculpted anew" slightly reduce subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is poetic and consistent, though dense phrasing in peaks may slightly obscure immediacy without harming closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm with no major loops; figurative language is purposeful and taught, though minor overwriting in metaphors like "echoes before silence" doesn't harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of memory and identity through unique concepts like shadow-reading; risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
