<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with interiority shown through embodied actions like whittling and narrating. The moral ambiguity of her deed (love vs. murder) creates compelling internal conflict, and her endurance is earned with visible cost. However, the blank-faced detachment occasionally limits emotional depth in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as the performer continues her rituals, costing emotional void. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, with patterns of performance and imagery tightening meaning. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the final image of "lightness lingered, morally ambiguous as mercy."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with turbines and farmhouse creating atmospheric pressure that constrains choices. The bouquet and whittling tools function as micro-settings, charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the POV's grief.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are internalized around grief and moral ambiguity, escalating through accumulative density in the performer's narration and whittling. Agency in her performance forecloses paths with cost, driven under the textural lens. Cost is felt in the emotional void, though escalation is subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, exploring moral ambiguity and performance as coping. Subtext is rich in gestures like the bouquet and whittling, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Complexity is embraced through plausible counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, rhythmic voice that reflects the character's perceptual signature. Compression and elision are taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; diction remains consistent under pressure, enhancing the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with varied sentence structures and purposeful figurative language. No loops or scaffold issues; clarity and propulsion are maintained even in peak beats. Minor overwriting is outweighed by overall craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is original and ingeniously synthesized, with specific details like the happiness mandate and performance rituals transforming familiar tropes. Risk-taking in style and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
