<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and deeply rooted in backstory, driving Elowen's actions consistently; her need for borrowed heartbeats adds stakes, though internal conflict is minimal, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost under an accumulative lens; Elowen's renewal of her heartbeat and alteration of mirrors reconfigures possibilities, with the persistent constraint of borrowed life shaping the finale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and actively constrains choices; the prism parapet charges the climax by enabling Elowen's art, with sensory details enhancing atmosphere without excess.</comment>
