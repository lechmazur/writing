<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her key choice to embed the gear; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "sentimentality swelled"), and the final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost (her dimming form).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with cost (Elowen's dimming, troubled serenity) as a Resonant Reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens; orientation is clear early, and the gear's persistent constraint shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is integral, with the nebula garden and sonar pinging constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details are vivid and purposeful, filtered through Elowen's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elowen's agency under the accumulative lens, with one meaningful tightening (embedding the gear) that narrows options and legible cost (her dimming, perpetual risk); stakes are dominant and felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and imagery, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to cycles and choice through the fledgling's vision; subtext operates in gesture and implication without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a poetic perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure and purposeful elision (e.g., sonar pinging) are taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, but minor repetition (e.g., "troubling serenity") slightly dulls momentum; no major artifacts obscure closure, and figurative language is pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of nebula imagery and generational patterns; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and transformation through specific details feels inevitable.</comment>
