<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative; her expectant resignation and the choir members' transformations are earned through concrete micro-choices, such as Joren's rage softening, with visible cost in their unlearning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens; the choir's harmony is a decisive change with felt cost, and the zither's rosette persistently shapes tactics, maintaining causality throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The velvet library and autumn setting are vividly specific and pressure choices; the zither's rosette constrains actions and charges the final image, with sensory details filtered through Elara's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in the choir's gradual harmony; the dominant stake of unlearning hatred tightens through meaningful deepening, though minor vagueness in timeframe slightly limits peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of harmony through subtraction emerges organically from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext operates in gestures like the rosette's symbolism, deepening complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision (e.g., timeframe) is taught and paid off, without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, but minor overwriting (e.g., repeated "expectantly resigned") and template cadence in peaks cause slight artifacts without harming closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of subtracting noise for harmony is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming familiar tropes through specific details.</comment>
