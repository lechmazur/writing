<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving his choices with embodied emotion and internal conflict. His transformation into "archivist of the revealed" is earned through prior causality, with cost legible in overcoming doubt. Minor weakness: some emotional beats could be more nuanced, but closure is strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from arrows to train to fortress. Closure is a decisive change on-page: Elias becomes archivist, with cost in "bad habits shattered." Orientation is clear within 120 words, and no plot amnesia.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (cracks as arrows, vault mist) and charges the final image of "whispering stone." Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's analytical eye. Minor over-description in places doesn't harm momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is agency-driven under causal lens: Elias dares to follow arrows, punch tickets, and board train, narrowing options. Cost is visible in "trembling certainty" and foreclosed paths. Stakes remain abstract but are concretized through actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mapping truths and personal transformation emerges through particulars like cracks and ticket punch, without moralizing. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer: "map to his own unspoken heart." Earned through struggle and imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—analytical yet artistic prose. Voice modulates under pressure ("trembling certainty"). Minimal dialogue advances plot; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "like fog made solid") doesn't obscure clarity. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion maintains momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes route mapping with mystical urban exploration in a fresh, non-obvious way. Tropes transformed through specific details (phantom punch, crack arrows). Risk-taking in style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
