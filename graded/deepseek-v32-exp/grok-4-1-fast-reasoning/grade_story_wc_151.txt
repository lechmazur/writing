<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her backstory, with embodied emotions (sweat beading) and micro-choices under pressure. Her final action feels earned by prior causality, and the trait "carefully inventive" is demonstrated through her chalk code creation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in the paused moment and etched chalk heart, under an accumulative lens that holds. Orientation is clear early, and the structure is a single scene with one meaningful tightening around the code's completion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices (arcade's futurism juxtaposed with chalk), with the chalk and clipboard constraining actions and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (evading surveillance), and escalation is driven by Elara's agency in creating the code, with cost legible in her sweat and pause. Under the accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of meaning in margins emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in the chalk codes. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the secrets flying free in margins.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature. Dialogue (vendor bot) is natural and brief. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density, but some figurative language in peak beats (e.g., "dew-kissed tiles like forgotten holograms") slightly risks overwriting without harming clarity. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of pseudonym creation, surface mail, and chalk codes in a futuristic setting feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth is specific and integrated.</comment>
