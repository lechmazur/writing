<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to investigate the glow and decipher the board. Her interiority is concrete through self-chatter and micro-choices, though her curiosity feels slightly one-dimensional without deeper flaws. The final activation is earned by prior actions, with cost in overcoming isolation and starlings.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strong with clear because/therefore linkages from discovery to activation. Closure is a decisive change as she repels starlings and sets a new course, with cost legible in the threat and her isolation. Orientation is anchored early, and no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the airship and hopscotch board constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like swirling starlings and dusty planks are purposeful, filtered through Elara's POV, and integrate into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovery escalates through starlings' threat and deciphering, driven by Elara's agency. Cost is visible in the risk of grounding, but resolution feels slightly convenient. One meaningful tightening occurs as she activates the board.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of exploration and isolation emerges through events and images, not statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with her ascent to legend. No moralizing, but depth is limited by length.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Elara's curious, sociable voice. Dialogue with herself feels natural and goal-driven. Prose texture is consistent, and no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose has good rhythm and density, advancing story without major loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in phrases like "stranded luminance" but clarity remains. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Premise feels fresh with specific synthesis of airship exploration and hidden cipher. Tropes are transformed through character details, but not groundbreaking. Emotional truth in isolation supports originality without gimmickry.</comment>
