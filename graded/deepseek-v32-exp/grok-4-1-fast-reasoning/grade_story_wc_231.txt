<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's characterization is strong with concrete interiority and embodied emotion; his motivation to decode the stranger's gesture drives credible micro-choices, and his final renunciation of isolation is earned through prior causality. However, minor abstraction in the investigation slightly reduces pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias pins the boutonnière, reconfiguring his isolation with felt cost; orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without contradiction, though the memory flashes could be more tightly woven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The opal dock and mist are vividly rendered and constrain choices, such as the mist swallowing the splash and the dock's surface influencing Elias's kneeling; sensory details are selective and purposeful, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency to investigate, narrowing options under the Accumulative lens; the cost is legible in his acceptance of shared isolation, though the stakes could be more visceral in middle beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer to isolation and connection; subtext in the Edelweiss and borrowed memories avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic with stable POV; rhythmic control under pressure and perceptual signature are strong, though minor register consistency in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, but slight overwriting in phrases like "frozen whispers" causes minor figurative muddle; no major artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lighthouse keeper, borrowed memories, and Edelweiss symbolism feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
