<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative, but interiority is limited with minimal embodied emotion or internal conflict, reducing depth despite earned final choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost via calcification, a Conceptual Repricing under the accumulative/textural lens; orientation is clear early, and causality holds without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory-rich setting constrains choices (e.g., grotto and lamp shape tactics) and charges the final image, though some description borders overwriting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in her trapping and calcification; stakes tighten meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of burdens and transformation emerges through concrete images and the calcified monument, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct poetic voice and stable POV with rhythmic control; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., "boundary-lessly") is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting (e.g., repetitive "shingled hush") and figurative stacking slightly reduce clarity in peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fractal weaving and burden collection feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure is fully committed.</comment>
