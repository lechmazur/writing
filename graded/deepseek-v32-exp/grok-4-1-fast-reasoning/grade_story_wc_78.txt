<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation to turn obstacles into instruments is clear and drives the plot; his fierce grin and relentless dubbing under pressure reveal character through micro-choices. Interiority is embodied in restlessness and exhaustion, with cost legible at closure. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; final endurance is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change: the storm is repelled, and safe passage is achieved, with cost felt as Elowen slumps. Causal lens holds tightly from cloud interpretation to dubbing crescendo. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no plot amnesia or teleporting props.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices: the driftwood circle and storm threaten the haven, constraining tactics. Sensory details like "sapphire shards" and "salt-rimed tattoos" are selective and POV-filtered. The orchard afloat charges the final image of defiance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of survival escalates through waves and debris, driven by Elowen's agency in dubbing. Cost is legible in his exhaustion and the orchard's lingering euphony. One meaningful tightening under causal lens: obstacles transmute into instruments through protagonist choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transforming chaos into harmony emerges through events and images, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "storm into symphony." Subtext operates in gesture and implication, avoiding moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and rhythmically controlled, reflecting Elowen's focus. No head-hopping; elision like "fractal generating" is taught and pays off. Diction remains within character lexicon even under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and propulsion, but slight overwriting in figurative language ("pulsed with restless euphony") occurs without muddling peak beats. No loops or scaffold; sentence rhythm varies naturally, supporting closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and organic: tide prophet using music to harness storms transforms tropes through specific details. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in lyric density heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
