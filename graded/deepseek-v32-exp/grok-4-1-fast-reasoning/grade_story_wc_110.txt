<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to thaw mistrust is clear and drives key choices; Mira's internal conflict is embodied through hesitant visits and dawning realization. The resolution is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her confession and his ended solitude. Contradictory impulses act in scene, and the final change is credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orientation is anchored early; accumulative/textural lens holds with symbolic buildup leading to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page with felt cost as mistrust melts and ledger closes, shaped by persistent constraints like the crystals and lens. Causality is coherent from eavesdropping to intervention.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt is vividly specific and constrains choices by amplifying whispers and projecting images. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, charging the final image. Micro-setting elements like the lens and tickets alter tactics and deepen atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake in Mira's internal conflict escalates through Elias's agency with the doodles and lens, leading to a tightening where honesty forces confrontation. Cost is legible in her admission and their shared silence. Protagonist agency under the accumulative lens drives meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of freedom through honesty emerges organically from symbols and actions, not statement; subtext operates in doodles and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via shared gaze and thawed mistrust, avoiding moralizing while reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Elias; voice is poetic and consistent with rhythmic control. Perceptual signature is distinct in filtering details through his perspective. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., silence) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats like the projection scene. Sentences advance story and atmosphere with concision and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes unique elements (crystal forecourt, cryptic doodles) into a non-obvious whole that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in symbolic communication heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity and transformation of tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
