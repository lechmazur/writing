<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in guilt and redemption, intensifying under pressure. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like trembling from resolve. The final choice to preserve sounds is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in her tears freezing and thawing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost (tears freezing/thawing), under an accumulative/textural lens that holds. Orientation is established early, and the climax of illumination reweights prior material. The method of reconfiguring braids is signaled and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum and aurora pressure choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like "snowmelt ardor" integrated into action. The ceremonial rope and punched card function as micro-settings that constrain tactics and shape closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in her emotional struggle and the physical act of reconfiguring the rope. The dominant stake of preservation tightens through her precise actions, leading to the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory and preservation emerges through events and images, not direct statement, with subtext in gestures like unspooling the rope. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the holographic voices, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical prose and selective attention. Elision, such as the punched card's purpose, is taught early and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, though minor overwriting occurs (e.g., "snowmelt ardor" repeated). No loops or scaffold artifacts harm closure; figurative language is coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style and concept of memory transcription. The combination is specific and transforms familiar tropes through character-driven choices.</comment>
