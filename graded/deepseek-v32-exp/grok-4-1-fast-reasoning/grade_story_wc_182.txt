<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving key choices, but interiority lacks depth with minimal embodied emotion or internal conflict under pressure. The time traveler is functional but underdeveloped, reducing relational crucible potential.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with logical linkages from inciting incident to closure; on-page decisive change (library entry) lands, but cost feels lightly implied rather than deeply felt in the final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, constraining choices (e.g., Echo-Lilies in Verdant Stacks) and charging the final image; sensory details are purposeful and woven through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist-driven rescue missions, narrowing options under causal lens; cost is visible in dangers faced, though peak choice lacks heavy moral calculus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of unlearned lessons emerges organically through quest and pact renegotiation, with subtext in botanical bridges; avoids moralizing, but resonance is slightly muted by pace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice consistently poetic, with perceptual signature in Elara's linguistic focus; dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision (e.g., pact gaps) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid but occasionally overwritten (e.g., "unheard symphony" metaphor stack), with minor template cadence in rescue beats; clarity and momentum remain strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes fresh elements (library of unlearned lessons, botanical diary) with specificity; transformation of tropes through grounded world logic and character choices feels inevitable.</comment>
