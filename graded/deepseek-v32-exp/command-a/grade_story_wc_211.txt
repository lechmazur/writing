<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to archive emotional patterns is clear and consistent, driving her actions. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like "heart quickened" and micro-choices under pressure, such as deciding to immerse herself in the mystery. The final choice to speak the dead language is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the garden's sigh of relief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with strong linkages: the silent foghorn and phonograph shaving incite the prophecy discovery, leading to deciphering symbols and the climax where Elara speaks the words. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in the garden's response and the "velvet disquiet." Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ancient orchard garden atop a skyscraper is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as Elara walking its paths and discovering symbols on the oak. Sensory details like "leaves rustling" and "golden light" are purposeful, and the setting charges the final image by fulfilling its purpose with a sigh of relief.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is uncovering the prophecy's meaning, escalating through Elara's agency under the causal lens: playing the phonograph, deciphering symbols, and speaking the words. Cost is legible in the garden's response, foreclosing options and deepening her commitment to the work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory and emotional preservation emerges through particulars like the phonograph shaving and orchard symbols, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Elara's realization that her work continues an ancient civilization's efforts, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, such as Elara's professional bias noting "tongues of the forgotten." Prose rhythm modulates with pressure, e.g., short sentences in climax ("I remember," she said). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high information density, advancing story through selective detail. Rhythm varies naturally, e.g., "The sun began to set, casting the garden in a golden light." Minor scaffold in phrases like "velvet disquiet" is purposeful and does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and non-obvious, synthesizing an orchard on a skyscraper with emotional archiving. Specific details like the wax cylinder phonograph shaving and dead languages transform tropes. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
