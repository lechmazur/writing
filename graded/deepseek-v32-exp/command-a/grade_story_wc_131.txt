<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The crawl space dweller's motivation is clear and consistently drives their methodical actions, with embodied emotions like the "flicker of sense memory" adding depth. Their internal conflict between safety and visibility escalates under pressure, culminating in an earned realization about belonging. However, the final choice lacks strong contradictory impulses in scene, slightly limiting the cost's rawness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as the tape reel hums to life, reconfiguring the dweller's stance on visibility with felt cost ("weight of their own cached memories begin to lift"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong through gradual fragment discovery, and orientation is clear early. Slight vagueness in the alcove discovery doesn't undermine the cohesive escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory details like "sapphire hush" and "metallic veins," and the library environment actively constrains choices by guiding the dweller through pipe chases to the fragments. The tape reel fragments charge the final image, fulfilling the 9+ test with purposeful integration that shapes the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes of visibility versus safety are signaled early and escalate through the dweller's agency in uncovering fragments, narrowing options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the risk to their sanctuary and emotional lift at closure. However, the escalation lacks a sharp tightening or trade-off, keeping it from higher bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory and connection emerges organically from the cache discovery, with subtext in gestures like the dweller's "kindly heart" and the tape's message. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Some explicitness in the realization ("to become visible was not just to be seen") slightly dampens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a poetic, perceptual signature evident in phrases like "sapphire hush" and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in the closure. The prose consistently reflects the dweller's methodical yet yearning interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied syntax and vivid imagery, avoiding loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "ferromagnetic pull" is purposeful and coherent. Minor purple tinges in peak beats (e.g., "sapphire hush") are voice-motivated and don't obscure clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a crawl space dweller with tape reel fragments feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in the accumulative, lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry. However, the concept isn't fully groundbreaking, capping originality at this band.</comment>
