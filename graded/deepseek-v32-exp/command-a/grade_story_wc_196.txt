<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. Her decision to unfurl the history is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her lighter heart, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (Elara's smile and heart lighter), under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The dust patterns method and persistent constraints shape tactics, and orientation is anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The foster care file room is vividly rendered with sensory detail, and the dust patterns and button function as micro-setting that constrain choices and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Elara's agency, with stakes deepening from personal curiosity to a mission to mend brokenness. Cost is legible in her emotional transformation, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars, with subtext in objects and actions. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the shimmering dust and Elara's purpose, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is consistent and evocative, with no head-hopping or elision issues, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is clear and concise with high information density, but minor clichés like "forgotten promises" slightly reduce freshness. No loops or scaffold artifacts, and propulsion is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of archivist, foster care, and historical artifact feels organic and specific, with risk-taking in the accumulative approach. However, it is not fully groundbreaking, though execution is strong.</comment>
