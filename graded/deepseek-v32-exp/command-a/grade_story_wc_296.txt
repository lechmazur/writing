<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eira's motivation is clear and rooted in her guarded nature, intensifying under pressure. Her interiority is concrete with embodied emotions, and the final admission "I failed" is earned with visible cost. Minor stock phrasing in "warlike serenity" slightly limits the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with Eira's confession and the vortex healing, under a causal lens that holds throughout. Cost is legible in her admission and the transformation, with orientation clear early. The seed's role as a key is well-integrated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "scent of ripe fruit and decay" integrated into action. The vortex constrains Eira's choices and charges the final image, enhancing atmosphere and specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Eira's agency under the causal lens, from entering the vortex to unbending and confessing. Cost is unmistakable in her admission and the lake's healing, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges naturally from events and images, such as the seed as a mirror revealing hidden truths. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through Eira's vulnerability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Prose is lyrical but consistent, with purposeful elision taught early. Minor convergence in tone under pressure limits the score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence structures and no major loops or figurative muddle. Read-aloud rhythm is strong, though minor decorative phrasing exists.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements like the flesh-eating seed and frozen confession are synthesized in a non-obvious way, transforming tropes through specific choices. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
