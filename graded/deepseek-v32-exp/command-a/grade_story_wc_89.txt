<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and a credible earned change. The final realization that the bond is with herself is rooted in prior causality, though the guardian's challenge resolves somewhat swiftly, slightly reducing the struggle's depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with felt cost as Elara's weight lifts, under a coherent causal lens. The fortune cookie message initiates a tight because/therefore chain to the transformation, and the persistent constraint of her past shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The orchard setting actively guides choices by shifting to reveal the guardian, with sensory details like shimmering fruit and rare spices filtering through Elara's POV. The environment constrains her path and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled and escalate through Elara's agency, as her conjuring under the guardian's pressure forces a trade-off between past and self. Cost is legible in her lifted weight and renewed purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of self-bond emerges organically from Elara's journey, with subtext in gestures like clutching the fortune paper. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though the epiphany leans slightly explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic diction ("paradoxically steady") and perceptual signature filtering the orchard through Elara's urgency. Dialogue from the guardian is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
