<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Herald's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions like panic and awe under pressure. Micro-choices, such as steering the beam, reveal values and are earned by prior causality. However, some abstract phrasing like "shadowed elation" slightly dulls concrete interiority, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—the gateway opening—under a causal lens, and cost is legible in the Herald's realization and the new dawn's emergence. Orientation is clear early, and the wick's constraint shapes tactics. No causality breaks; the plan feeling "set in motion long ago" is smoothly integrated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the emerald lighthouse and wick constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details (e.g., "green glow," "shimmering fog") are purposeful and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography remains coherent, and the environment actively pressures the Herald's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Herald's agency under the causal lens, from loss of beam control to active steering, with cost felt in the awe-filled resolution. The dominant stake (shaping a new dawn) tightens meaningfully, and the climax forces a trade-off between control and revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the beam bridging worlds, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the Herald's laughter deepening with understanding. However, slight explicitness in "unknowingly been preparing" limits ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature ("beam slicing through the night like a sword"). Rhythm and syntax modulate with pressure, and elision (e.g., the fog's origins) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing multiple roles (e.g., "laughter echoed softly" sets tone and character). Minor overwriting in phrases like "shadowed elation" causes slight figurative strain, but no loops or scaffolds harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of lighthouse mysticism and prophetic duty, with specifics like the wick's mechanics feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
