<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure; the final shift from solitude to community is earned, though minor clichés like "heart swelled" slightly detract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with cost (cyclical task dimming), causal lens holds tightly, and orientation is immediate; the persistent constraint of moon phases shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the station and censer foot constraining choices and charging the finale; specificity is purposeful and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens, from calls to building to travelers; cost is legible in raw hands and cyclical dimming, foreclosing isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of loss and solace emerges through events and images, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though some abstraction lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic rhythm and controlled elision; dialogue is minimal but natural, and perceptual signature remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high density and propulsion, with varied syntax and no loops; minor clichés exist but do not obscure closure or cause artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and synthesized inevitably, with risk in poetic style; specific details transform tropes, and the closure image reinforces originality.</comment>
