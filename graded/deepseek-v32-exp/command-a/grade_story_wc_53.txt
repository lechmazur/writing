<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. The final choice to rebuild is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her spark of hope reconfiguring regret. Interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing, and her chronological confusion adds depth without undermining agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the final image of fractured stillness as a beginning. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with fragments building to a reweighting of stakes. Orientation is clear early, and the camera wheel's hum guides causality without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon and objects like the camera wheel constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details filtered through Mara's POV. Setting pressures tactics, such as the lagoon's currents guiding her path, and specificity avoids generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Mara's agency in collecting fragments, tightening the stake of negotiating with her ghost. Cost is legible in the regret that forecloses paths and the hope that reconfigures options, with one meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of rebuilding from fragments emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in objects like the camera wheel. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through Mara's realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in rhythmic prose that modulates with emotional pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., chronological confusion) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythm and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, such as "fractured stillness," and peak beats remain coherent without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of surreal setting and personal struggle, with tropes transformed through specific details like the camera wheel. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
