<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with a credible shift from innocence to determination. Her interiority is concrete, though some emotions are described rather than fully embodied in peak beats. The final choice is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, with Elara's decision to be the ocean's voice reweighting prior material. The cost is legible in her numbness turning to purpose. The lens holds without ambiguity, and the structure is coherent for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium and brain coral fragment are vividly integrated, constraining Elara's choices and charging the final image with symbolic weight. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, though occasional over-description slightly dampens momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's active deciphering, leading to a meaningful tightening that forecloses options and reveals the map. Agency drives the conflict under the accumulative lens, with cost felt in her emotional shift and renewed purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through symbols and actions, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to questions of memory and healing, with subtext in the child's notes and coral's glow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature that reflects Elara's perspective. Rhythm and diction control heighten pressure, though minor ornate phrasing occurs. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical, with high information density and varied rhythm. However, slight overwriting and figurative muddle in emotional peaks cause minor momentum drag. No major loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements feels fresh and inevitable, with the coral and notes transforming familiar tropes through specific detail. Risk-taking in lyricism pays off, enhancing stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
