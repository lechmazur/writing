<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to excavate truth is consistent and drives key choices, with interiority shown through concrete observations like feeling the hum. Her final decision to contain the stillpoint is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost. However, her competence borders on slight over-efficiency, lacking deeper internal contradiction under peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—stabilizing the stillpoint—and cost is legible in the diamond going inert and dust storms returning. Causal lens holds tightly from investigation to resolution, with the flawed diamond as a persistent constraint. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph, anchoring who, where, and when.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with the wasteland orchard and radioactive dust storms, sensory details like the "still air" and "faint hum" reflecting POV bias. The orchard actively constrains choice by shielding the stillpoint and charging the final image of fragile balance. Micro-setting elements (diamond, letters) are integrated into action and pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth versus safety escalates through Elara's agency under the causal lens, as her discoveries about the stillpoint's danger force a costly containment choice. Cost is unmistakable in the diamond's inert state and returned dust storms. One meaningful tightening—from sustenance to prison—forecloses options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of truth's cost emerges organically from events like reassembling letters and the stillpoint's revelation, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the dormant stillpoint and fragile balance, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in implication, such as the diamond's flaw symbolizing sealed danger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in Elara's observant voice. Prose rhythm and diction reflect her urgency, modulating under pressure. No head-hopping; purposeful compression in intuitive leaps is taught and paid off at closure. Dialogue is absent, so not evaluated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence structures and rhythmic control. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language like "pulsed with an eerie glow" is purposeful. Momentum is maintained even in reflective beats, and closure image is sharp without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic and conspiracy tropes through specific details like the stillpoint as prison. Transformation test passes—the emotional arc is tied to particulars. However, originality is slightly tempered by familiar archetypes (e.g., the truth-seeker), though executed with coherence and risk in the ambiguous ending.</comment>
