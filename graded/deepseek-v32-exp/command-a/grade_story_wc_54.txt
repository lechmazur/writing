<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and rooted in curiosity and a deeper search for hope, with interiority shown through concrete actions like picking up the sextant and experimenting. However, his emotional progression lacks contradictory impulses or significant struggle, making the final transformation feel slightly abstract rather than earned through intense internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Eli leaves with the sextant, feeling guided by the maze of intentions; cost is legible in his realization of a "new equation for hope." The accumulative/textural lens holds well, with patterns of air, light, and memory building to a cohesive ending. Orientation is clear early, and the structure supports the thematic arc without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral to the narrative, with sensory details like "cracked tiles" and "dim light" filtering through Eli's POV. The terminal constrains choices by providing resources (vents, mirrors) that Eli uses to redirect flows, and it charges the final image of resurrection, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Eli's agency under the accumulative lens, as his experiments with the sextant and terminal flows intensify the stake of finding hope. Cost is felt in his transformative effort, narrowing options from assessment to resurrection, though the pressure lacks a sharp external conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of hope and resurrection emerges organically through the sextant and terminal as symbols, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the "maze of intentions" within Eli. Subtext operates in imagery and implication, avoiding moralizing, but the concept borders on abstraction without deeper contradiction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with Eli's perceptual signature evident in his engineer-focused observations. Prose has a rhythmic, descriptive texture that supports the accumulative drive, and no head-hopping or dialogue issues arise, though voice could be more idiosyncratic under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propelled with varied sentence rhythms, avoiding loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "ghosts of travelers past" is purposeful, and information density is high, with no artifacts obscuring closure. Read-aloud test passes smoothly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The combination of civil engineer, abandoned spaceport, and sextant creates a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though it leans on familiar themes of resurrection and hope.</comment>
