<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. The final transformation is earned by prior causality, though minor tells in emotional description prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—Elena's embodiment of knowledge—under a causal lens, with cost legible in her foreclosed isolation. The sundial and memories shape tactics persistently, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the tidal library constraining choices through shifting shelves and mechanisms. The sundial as a recurring object charges the final image, enhancing specificity without ornamental detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elena's agency under the causal lens, from following the hum to unlocking the door and touching the orb, with cost unmistakable in her transformation. Stakes are tightly braided and deepen meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer to isolation and coexistence. Subtext operates through implication, though slight explicit statement in motivation phrasing limits perfection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with rhythmic control and a perceptual signature that reflects Elena's urgency. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and supports pressure, and sentence-level propulsion advances the story seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of concepts like the tidal library and reincarnation memory, transforming tropes with specific detail. Risk-taking in setting and closure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
