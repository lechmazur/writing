<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation is clear and drives the narrative; her internal conflict and embodied emotions are effective, though occasional phrases like "dynasty ender" border on stock labeling without deeper contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with felt cost as Eleanor accepts her role; causal lens holds tightly from gramophone use to vision revelation; orientation is immediate and persistent constraints shape the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice—the gramophone as micro-setting charges the closure; sensory details are selective and purposeful, avoiding generic placeholder syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency under causal lens; cost is legible in the painful truth revelation, though the vision sequence slightly relies on convenience rather than earned tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of truth and legacy emerges organically through events and images; ending offers a resonant, non-literal reweighting without moralizing, anchored in the journal's confession.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic diction; slight overwriting in peaks like "eloquently silent" causes minor register drift, but perceptual signature remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with good rhythm and density; minor artifacts include template cadence in "She rose... she placed..." and occasional ornate phrasing, but closure clarity unharmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sound mysticism and family legacy feels inevitable; specific details like the gramophone crank handle transform tropes, though the intuitive bridge concept risks slight familiarity.</comment>
