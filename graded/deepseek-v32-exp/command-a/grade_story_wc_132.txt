<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation evolves credibly from scientific observation to personal transformation, with embodied interiority and contradictory impulses (control vs. surrender) acting in scene. The final choice to release control is earned by the leaf's catalytic role and storm's pressure, with visible cost in her drenched state and emotional shift. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing undermines the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a decisive change (Mara's surrender and reconstruction) with felt cost (physical discomfort and liberation) under a coherent causal lens. The linden leaf and storm season create because/therefore linkages that narrow options, and the persistent constraint of control shapes tactics until the final image. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and no outline sequencing breaks causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (nursery, mossy trellis, storm scents) and filtered through Mara's POV, with sensory detail purposeful and selective. The trellis and leaf constrain choices by shifting from barrier to gateway and catalyzing transformation, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details integrate into action without generic clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict between control and surrender) escalates under the causal lens through protagonist agency (leaf examination, rearrangement of pots). Cost is legible in Mara's drenched state and emotional liberation after releasing control. Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully without coincidence resolving the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of metamorphosis through surrender emerges organically from events and images (leaf, storm, trellis) without direct statement or moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mara's transformation and the leaf's dissolution, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, avoiding simplistic binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (Mara's plant-focused, introspective voice). Prose rhythm and syntax modulate with emotional intensity, and purposeful compression (e.g., "circuitously sincere") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register mismatch; internal voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language (e.g., "thoughts winding like vines") is consistent and voice-motivated, with no mixed metaphors or register drift in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs, and clarity is maintained through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of plant symbolism and internal metamorphosis, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices (nursery setting, leaf as catalyst). Risk-taking in lyrical, internal focus heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
