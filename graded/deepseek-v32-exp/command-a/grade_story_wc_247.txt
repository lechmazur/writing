<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion in gestures like "her hands moved fluidly." Interiority is concrete, though some reflection leans summary. The final choice to shape silence is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her bittersweet smile and the camera's click.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as the silence becomes "alive with meaning," costing Elara her energy but alighting her spirit. The accumulative lens holds, building through patterned imagery to a decisive change. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The harbor and camera are vivid and sensory, but the setting primarily atmospherically supports rather than constrains choices. The camera charges the final image by clicking without film, refracting light, and embodying history, meeting the micro-setting test for high bands.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes around giving voice to silence escalate through Elara's agency under the accumulative lens, with gestures intensifying to a "new purpose" and the camera's response. Cost is felt in her spent energy and bittersweet joy, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as language emerges coherently from events and images, with subtext in gestures and the camera's click. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "silence alive with meaning," avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Elara, with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature in noticing "starlight" and "prisms." No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, such as the camera's unexplained click, paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density, but minor artifacts include paraphrase loops (e.g., "silence" reiterated) and template cadence in introspective beats. No figurative muddle in peaks; rhythm supports accumulation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of sign language, silent mapping, and a filmless camera is original and inevitable in hindsight, transforming tropes through specific character choices. Risk-taking in lyric design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
