<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion (e.g., fingers trembling) and micro-choices under pressure. The final endurance as guardian is earned by prior causality, though agency is somewhat passive for the textural lens, limiting higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative drive lens holds strong; closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the final image of commitment.

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details (rusted frames, salt-laden air) filtering through POV. The container labyrinth constrains choices and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ test for environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes in uncovering erased histories escalate through accumulative density, driven by protagonist agency in discoveries.

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and erasure emerges organically through images and events, with subtext in the poison label and archives. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting the act of remembering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and stable, with poetic, reflective diction matching the POV. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent, though the lack of dialogue limits evaluation of character distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is purposeful, though minor purple hues in peaks prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise of death certificate survivor and erased histories is fresh and transformed through specific details. Synthesis feels inevitable, but risk-taking is moderate, lacking bold structural innovations.</comment>
