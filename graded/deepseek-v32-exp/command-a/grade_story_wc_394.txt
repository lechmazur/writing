<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and drives the narrative, with embodied emotion shown through calloused hands and trembling fingers. However, internal conflict is limited, and traits like "steadily curious" are stated rather than fully dramatized through contradictory impulses, preventing higher marks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the bell's ring awakens the world, costing a shift in Lira's resolve under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the algorithm shapes tactics, though the bell's vanishing slightly softens the cost's immediacy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The workshop and acid sea are vividly specific, with sensory details like "fogged windows" and "churning waves" that pressure Lira's isolation and focus. The kaleidoscope as a micro-setting constrains her choices by driving the algorithm's breakthrough, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Lira's agency under the causal lens, from tireless work to ringing the bell, with cost legible in the world's response and her continued yearning. One meaningful tightening forecloses her initial goal, though the aftermath feels slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of yearning emerges through images like the bell and arrow tip, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the "yearning algorithm" concept borders on explicit, slightly reducing subtextual depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Lira's technical lexicon and awe-filled observations. No head-hopping; prose rhythm modulates with pressure, as in the accelerated whirring during the breakthrough.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally concise and vivid, with strong information density, but minor overwriting occurs, such as "steadily curious mind" leaning toward label-speak. No major artifacts obscure causality, though sentence stems show slight repetition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of steampunk workshop and philosophical algorithm feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the bell's conceptual payoff. Specific details like the acid sea and kaleidoscope avoid template plots, elevating originality.</comment>
