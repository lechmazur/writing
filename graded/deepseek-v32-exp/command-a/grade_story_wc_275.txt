<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glass-domed farm and airship scrap constrain choices and charge the final image with vivid sensory detail. Setting is woven into action, pressing Elara's decisions and mirroring internal states without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate coherently under causal lens via Kael's warning and blade offer, forcing Elara's agency-driven choice to fortify. Cost is legible in her compromised pacifism, but escalation lacks a deeper tightening of options.</comment>
