<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's characterization is deeply rooted in consistent traits of guilt and care for broken things, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His final renunciation—leaving the box—is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost. However, minor abstraction in interiority prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost when Elias places the box on the ridge. The lens holds throughout, and orientation is clear early. The persistent constraint of his scars shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge and cracked porcelain box charge the final image, constraining choice and mirroring internal states. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, with the box evolving from relic to vessel, deepening thematic resonance without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Elias's agency in reflecting and handling the box, leading to a deepening that changes knowledge. The cost is legible when he seals the box, renouncing guilt for purpose with visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of bargained innocence emerges organically through images like the box and feather, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in the final reconfiguration avoids sentimentality, inviting reflection through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic yet grounded—and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision in reflection is taught and pays off at closure, though minor register consistency holds it back from higher bands.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, though slight purple tinge in peaks prevents a 9+ score. Closure image remains clear and propelled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of scarred firefighter and transformative object feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in internal focus heightening stakes. Emotional specificity avoids templates, and the core concept is fully committed without derivative echoes.</comment>
