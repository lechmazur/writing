<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving key choices like following the photographs and creating the exhibit. Interiority is concrete but could be more embodied under pressure; "felt a surge of purpose" leans toward telling. Micro-choices reveal values, and the final action is earned, but lacks deep internal contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the town's emotional resurfacing reweights meaning, with cost legible in the townspeople's reactions. The Accumulative lens holds through patterned imagery, and orientation is clear early. No causality breaks, but the wind chime's silence as a signal feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and selective, e.g., "glassy surface" and "damp earth," filtered through Elias's POV. The ridgeway and photographs constrain choices by guiding his journey, charging the final image. Atmosphere coheres with tone, though spatial choreography is minimal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (town's memory) escalates through Elias's agency under the Accumulative lens, with density increase from discovered photographs to exhibit. Cost is felt in the emotional healing, narrowing options from neglect to action. One meaningful tightening suffices, but stakes remain positive without deep trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory and healing emerges through particulars like the label "L'Oubliée" and photographs, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer via the exhibit, reweighting prior material with resonance. Subtext operates in imagery, though some moments verge on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., Elias's vigilance coloring observations. Prose rhythm and diction are controlled, and elision (e.g., wind chime's role) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift, but dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language, like "stars beginning to prick the sky," is coherent and purposeful. Sentences advance story and atmosphere seamlessly, though minor overwriting exists in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes memory recovery through specific details (levee warden, photographs), feeling organic and inevitable. Tropes are transformed with emotional specificity, and risk-taking in quiet resolution heightens stakes. Fresh angle on familiar material, but not fully groundbreaking.</comment>
