<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in tangible longing, with micro-choices like following the light and descending the hatch demonstrating agency. His final vow feels earned by prior causality, though his initial passivity slightly limits the score. Embodied emotion and interior contradiction are present but not deeply layered under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elias commits to his vow, with cost legible in his renewed purpose. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with imagery and mood driving progression. Orientation is clear early, and the structure is cohesive for the length, though the inciting incident relies slightly on convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (e.g., "soft glow across the water," "rustled hatch") create a rich atmosphere that constrains choice, as the library setting directly enables the vow. The "meteor hush" tone charges the final image, and POV filtering is consistent, elevating the score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are personal (longing for meaning) and escalate through Elias's agency under the accumulative lens, culminating in the vow with visible cost. However, the conflict is largely internal, and the escalation lacks multiple tightening points, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events, such as the key tag and vows, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the quest for meaning. Subtext operates in silences and implications, avoiding moralizing or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control, evident in phrases like "meteor hush that seemed to cradle the world." Purposeful compression and poetic diction enhance the accumulative drive without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied syntax and clear propulsion, avoiding loops or scaffolding. Figurative language like "luminous vow" is purposeful and coherent, and the read-aloud rhythm supports the atmosphere without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements (lamplighter, key tag, sunken library) feels fresh and inevitable, with emotional specificity and risk-taking in the lyrical approach. Tropes are transformed through grounded details, and the closure reweights prior material uniquely.</comment>
