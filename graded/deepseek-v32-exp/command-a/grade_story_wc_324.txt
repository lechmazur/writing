<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by curiosity and duty, with embodied emotions like trembling fingers and quickened heart. However, the characterization lacks deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses, making the arc somewhat tidy and less complex. The final choice to protect the story is earned but without significant cost or struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elara commits to her role, with cost felt in the photograph's warmth. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through atmospheric details. Orientation is clear early, and causality is logical, though the pulses guide her somewhat passively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium and objects like the hearing aid and photograph are vividly described and charge the final image, constraining Elara's path. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, but the setting could exert more active pressure on choices beyond atmospheric guidance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled and escalate through Elara's agency in tracking pulses and finding the photograph, with cost legible in her resolve. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through density increase, but the conflict lacks a sharp turning point or trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of protecting forgotten stories emerges organically through events and images, with subtext in whispers and the photograph's expression. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though it leans slightly toward thematic statement in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, reflecting Elara's curiosity and empathy. Perceptual signature is strong, and prose rhythm supports emotional beats, though no dialogue is present to test character distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and dense, with varied sentences and no loops or overwriting. Figurative language is purposeful, and clarity is maintained under pressure, but minor register consistency issues prevent higher bands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise of a "contact tracer for hearts" is fresh and imaginative, with specifics like the hearing aid and pulses feeling inevitable. Emotional truth is strong, but the concept of incidental heroism is more thematic than transformative in plot mechanics.</comment>
