<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and a credible earned stasis. The final choice to share the light is rooted in prior causality, though internal contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Lira's peace and the grotto's response. The Accumulative lens holds, with patterns of memory and sensory detail building to a legible before/after shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto and sea glass constrain choices and charge the final image, with vivid, POV-filtered sensory detail. The environment actively shapes Lira's actions and the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency in polishing the sea glass, under the Accumulative lens, with a meaningful tightening as the glow intensifies. Cost is legible in her transformed peace and the foreclosed path of past burdens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events, with subtext in memories and the sea glass. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to light and healing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control. Perception is character-specific, and any elision (e.g., memory shifts) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm. No major artifacts or loops; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, though minor overwriting in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The concept of an earthbound star watcher and pearl of stillness feels fresh and specific, with emotional truth. Risks in lyrical style heighten stakes, but some elements are familiar, limiting ingenuity.</comment>
