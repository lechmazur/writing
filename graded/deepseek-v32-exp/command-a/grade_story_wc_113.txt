<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clara's motivation is clear and rooted in her trait of being drawn to in-between spaces, with embodied emotion in moments like "her breath caught." Her internal conflict and micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing the patterns and humming, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final peace is earned through prior causality, though her agency is slightly passive at times.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in "profound sense of peace." The accumulative lens holds, building through atmosphere and pattern. Orientation is clear early, and the ghost's guidance provides coherent linkage without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integral, with the flooded opera house and flickering lanterns constraining choices (e.g., water sloshing, program disintegrating) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Clara's POV, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling the code escalates under the accumulative lens through Clara's agency, from finding the program to humming the melody. Cost is legible in her emotional transformation and the ghost's vanishing, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of in-between spaces and closure emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the ghost's melody and Clara's peace, avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, lyrical voice that reflects Clara's perception. No head-hopping; prose rhythm and diction are controlled under pressure, with purposeful elision in the ghost interaction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, as in "water damage creating images," and propulsion is maintained through concise, image-driven sentences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of flooded opera house, ghost composer, and water damage as code feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors emotional truth.</comment>
