<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his trait as a noticer, driving his actions consistently. Interiority is concrete and embodied, such as when he feels the "strange stillness" from the shard. The final choice to sanctify objects is earned, foreclosing other paths with visible cost in his renewed purpose. However, his passivity slightly limits the depth of internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost in Elias's sense of direction. The pattern of collecting objects tightens meaningfully, and the shard's glow binds them in a silent pact, reconfiguring his understanding. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The bay setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory details, like "waters mirroring the soft hues of dawn," and it subtly influences mood and choice. However, it does not heavily constrain tactics or charge the final image beyond atmosphere. Specificity is strong but lacks the necessary pressure on options for higher bands.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake in understanding hidden narratives escalates through Elias's agency in sanctifying objects, deepening under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible when the objects feel purposeful after the ritual, altering his perception. The tightening is driven by his choices, though it remains quiet rather than confrontational.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sanctifying the forgotten emerges organically from particulars like the displaced objects, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Elias's realization that the shard unlocks "quiet stories." Subtext operates in gestures and images, such as the objects binding in a "silent pact."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Elias's poetic observations like "the tone of the morning was a hushed blaze." Voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision is purposeful, such as the implied transitions in his walk. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with varied rhythm and high information density, advancing story and atmosphere seamlessly. No major loops or artifacts; figurative language like "a creeping normality noticer" is taught and paid off. Minor overwriting in phrases like "hushed blaze" is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of a "shard of hush" and a noticer transforms familiar tropes through specific, grounded details. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, though it leans on atmospheric novelty over bold structural choices.</comment>
