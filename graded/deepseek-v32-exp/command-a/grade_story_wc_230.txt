<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's rationality and motivation for psychological safety are clear and consistent, driving his choices under pressure. Interiority is concrete, e.g., "his rational mind weighing the risks," and micro-choices like taking the eye to the village reveal his values. However, internal contradiction is subtle rather than deeply layered, and the final endurance feels earned but not profoundly transformative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with cost on-page: "the weight of involuntary truth lifted from his chest" after the ritual. Causal lens holds tightly from discovery to resolution, with no orientation debt. The eye's constraint shapes tactics throughout, and the ending reconfigures stakes with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, e.g., "branches twisted by storms" and the orchard's "fractured grace" mirroring internal states. The orchard and eye function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of psychological safety escalates under causal lens through Elias's agency: finding the eye triggers truthfulness, forcing seeking help and performing the ritual. Cost is legible in the trade-off of truth and safety, narrowing options meaningfully. No coincidental resolutions; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, e.g., the eye as truth symbol, culminating in the resonant lesson on choosing truths. Subtext operates in silence and implication, but the final paragraph's explicit statement ("psychological safety wasn’t about avoiding truths...") slightly moralizes, reducing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature biased by Elias's rationality. Dialogue with Mara is natural and goal-driven. Prose rhythm and diction control heighten pressure, e.g., "involuntarily truthful" phrasing, without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is elegant and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; lines like "fractured grace" and the ritual recitation are crisp. Rhythm supports emotional beats, and closure image is undulled by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes post-virus world, truffle foraging, and truth-cursed relic with specificity and inevitability. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, e.g., the eye's psychological cost. Emotional truth avoids templates, and risk-taking in concept coheres without gimmickry.</comment>
