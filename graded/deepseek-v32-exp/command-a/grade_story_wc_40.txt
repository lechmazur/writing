<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal his values. His final bittersweet victory is earned by prior causality, showing contradictory impulses of triumph and sorrow with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the crystal drains, costing Elias its energy, under a causal lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the cost is legible in the crystal's fading echoes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The library atmosphere is vivid and selective, but the crystal as a micro-setting constrains choices and charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ test with purposeful sensory detail integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the causal lens, decoding the pattern with a visible cost as the crystal drains. The stake in restoring language tightens meaningfully, foreclosing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of language loss and renewal emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in the crystal's echoes. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; elision is taught and paid off in closure. No head-hopping, and voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats. No loops or scaffold issues obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of post-linguistic decay and sonic memory, transformed through specific character and stakes. Risk-taking in the quiet climax heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
