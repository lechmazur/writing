<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses in scene; emotions are described but not deeply embodied under pressure, and the final endurance feels earned but without visible cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong; closure via Resonant Reconfiguration (bell ringing) lands with felt cost through town's transformation; orientation is clear early, and persistent patience constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details and atmospheric specificity charge the final image, but the setting does not actively constrain choices, limiting higher-band eligibility despite purposeful integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under accumulative lens, with stakes tightening through rhythmic footsteps; cost is implied but not unmistakable on the page, preventing higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of harmony through rhythm emerges organically from events; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, supported by subtext in whispers and changes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept of sonic revival is fresh and specific, transforming tropes through grounded details; risk-taking in method heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
