<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her unique trait, driving her quest with consistent interiority. However, internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure, with emotions sometimes summarized rather than fully embodied in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in the final image of beauty in limits. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, and causality is intact, though the building's collapse feels slightly convenient but does not break coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the tree trunk library and decaying building constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Elara's POV, enhancing tension without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled and escalate through the building's groans and Elara's focused crafting, driven by her agency under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the collapse, but the external threat could be more integrated with her internal struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of limits and infinity emerges organically through concrete actions and the final image, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in Elara's reflections and the setting's decay.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with Elara's perceptual signature shaping prose rhythm and diction. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., coin mechanics) is taught and paid off, though minor register consistency issues in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic with high information density, avoiding loops or scaffold. Figurative language is effective, but slight overwriting in descriptive passages near closure slightly dulls momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (face-blind artist, tree library) feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style heightening stakes. Specific details anchor universals, and closure reconfigures meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
