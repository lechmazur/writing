<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's grief and motivation are clear, with micro-choices under pressure, but interiority sometimes leans toward summary rather than embodied contradiction in scene. The final renunciation is earned, with cost felt in her renewed determination.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Charged Poise with felt cost in Elara's transformation. Orientation is clear early, and the curtains' activation provides a meaningful tightening that reconfigures stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory setting constrains choice and charges the final image with ethereal glow; sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven through action to mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief vs. purpose) escalates under Accumulative lens through curtains' illumination; protagonist agency drives deepening, with cost legible in her whispered promise and renewed work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of finding life in decay emerges through particulars like origami and vine tattoo; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; lyrical voice modulates under pressure, and elision (e.g., curtain mechanics) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic control and density, though minor overwriting in figurative language ("air hummed with the weight of centuries") doesn't harm closure; no loops or artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mourning jewelry, observatory, and magical elements feels organic; risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming grief tropes.</comment>
