<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in personal trauma, with embodied emotions and internal conflict shown through her grappling with spirits' stories. Her final understanding of purpose is earned by prior causality, and micro-choices under pressure reveal her values. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; closure choice feels motivated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in the "profound stillness" and Elara's ease. Under the accumulative/textural lens, silence and whispers accumulate to reweight stakes. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity; cost is legible at the ending beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the prism sanctuary and net constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, reflecting POV bias. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment subtly mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens, with knots tightening and whispers intensifying to reweight stakes. Cost is legible in the heaviness of silence and her whispered plea. One meaningful tightening occurs, foreclosing options and leading to peace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mending broken things to mend oneself emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement. Subtext operates in silence and whispers, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic and consistent, with elision taught and paid off in the closure. No head-hopping; diction remains within Elara's lexicon, and psychic distance is intentional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of mask restoration and spirit communion, with specific details grounding the concept. Tropes are transformed through character-driven choices, and the emotional arc feels inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet theme heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
