<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve wonder is clear and consistent, driving her actions under pressure. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions and micro-choices, such as dipping her hand into the pool and using the creel. The final realization about identity as a process is earned through prior causality, though contradictory impulses are not strongly acted out in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Elara accepts the transformation of identities, with cost legible in the stabilized but altered forms. The causal lens holds tightly, with because/therefore linkages from the inciting incident to resolution. Orientation is clear within the first 120 words, and the structure coheres in a single scene with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tidal atrium setting is vividly rendered with bioluminescent runes and the central pool, constraining choices by serving as a gateway for smelting identities.

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled with the migrating identities, escalating through Elara's agency as she uses the orb and deciphers runes.

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of identity as a process emerges organically through events and images, such as the pool and runes, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Elara's realization, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in the whisper and her internal reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in Elara's observational style.
