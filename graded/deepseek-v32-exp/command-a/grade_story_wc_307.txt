<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her backwards aging, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices. The final revelation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her unburdening. However, minor diagnostic label-speak in peak beats slightly reduces specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the unburdening, under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds, but a slight ambiguity in the trance's mechanics prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The magnetic grotto and floating rock platform constrain choices and charge the final image, with vivid sensory details woven through action. The environment actively shapes Elara's revelation, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Elara's agency in the trance and revelation, with cost legible in her unburdening. The dominant stake of truth-telling tightens meaningfully, though the pressure coheres without multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth and absence emerges through events and images, with subtext in gestures and silences. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, but a minor thematic echo in "teach vanishing to appear" slightly limits freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, and elision in the trance is taught and paid off. Prose reflects character perception under pressure, though minor register consistency in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, and clarity is maintained in peak beats, but a slight template cadence in reflection passages limits perfection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The backwards aging premise is fresh and synthesized with meditation themes, offering a non-obvious angle. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes, but minor derivativeness in the revelation concept prevents a higher score.</comment>
