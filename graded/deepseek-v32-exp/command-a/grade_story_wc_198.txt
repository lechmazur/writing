<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and drives the narrative, but interiority lacks embodied contradiction under stress; the saxophonist's emotional state is described through external imagery rather than concrete internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as the prophecy dissolves and the grotto exhales, under a consistent accumulative/textural lens; orientation is clear early, and causality holds through the music's effect on the environment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the grotto and prism atrium constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details are integrated into action and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the saxophonist's agency, with the music intensifying and the grotto responding, leading to a legible cost in the effort to silence the prophecy; stakes are clear and tighten under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the conflict between art and prophecy, with subtext in imagery and the quiet resolution; no moralizing, but resonance is slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic diction and rhythmic control; no head-hopping, and perceptual signature is consistent throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and precise with good momentum, though minor overwriting in figurative language occurs; no significant loops or artifacts, and closure clarity is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise is original and specific, transforming tropes through grounded details in character and setting; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
