<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving key choices like the counter-frequency interference. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as "her expression cautiously hopeful," and her final decision to stay vigilant is earned by prior causality. However, contradictory impulses are not deeply explored in scene, limiting the score from the 9+ band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (signal disruption and community division) and felt cost under a causal lens. The plot escalates through because/therefore linkages, from decoding to interference, with orientation anchored early. The persistent constraint of cosmic tricksters shapes tactics, but minor ambiguity in the community's off-stage reaction prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices, like the radio station's equipment enabling the counter-frequency. Sensory details ("dimly lit confines," "hum of outdated equipment") are filtered through Elara's POV and charge the final image of the station as a bastion. However, the community divide is less tactile, slightly reducing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (countering the signal) escalates through Elara's agency, culminating in her interference that narrows options with cost (community protests). Under the causal lens, pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully. The cost is legible on-page, but the external conflict's resolution relies slightly on off-stage elements, limiting the score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of human ingenuity vs. cosmic deception emerges implicitly through events and images, like the signal's distortion and Elara's vigilance. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, subtext is occasionally light, with some thematic statements nearing explicitness in the community divide description.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a scientific yet hopeful tone reflecting Elara's expertise. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in Hank's interaction. Perceptual signature is clear, but minor convergence in emotional peaks prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without artifacts. Sentences like "The air vibrated faintly" show sensory specificity. No loops or scaffold issues, and figurative language is purposeful, though a slight register drift in "cosmic tricksters" briefly clashes with the POV's lexicon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of celestial mystery and gritty determination, with tropes transformed through specific choices like the subsonic frequency method. Emotional truth in Elara's arc feels inevitable, but some elements (e.g., community divide) are less uniquely inflected, limiting risk-taking elevation.</comment>
