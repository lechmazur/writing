<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His final realization is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a conceptual repricing via Kael's understanding of interconnectedness, with felt cost in the world's changed feel. The accumulative/textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tidal bluff and aurora are vividly specific, constraining choices through the rocks and eels, and charging the final image with the new pattern. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency in harnessing the star dust, under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in his realization. The stake in understanding patterns tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of interconnectedness emerges organically from events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in the eels' dance enriches.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, and perceptual signature is consistent. No head-hopping; elision in visions is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats like the aurora surge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of eel herder, precognition, and mathematical sequences feels inevitable, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional specificity avoids templates.</comment>
