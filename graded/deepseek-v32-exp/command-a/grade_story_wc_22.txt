<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with micro-choices under pressure, but internal conflict is minimal and emotions occasionally abstract, such as "his heart felt a spark of something new—possibility," reducing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost in the transformation of the jetty, under an accumulative/textural lens that holds throughout; orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the soil and hope.</comment>
