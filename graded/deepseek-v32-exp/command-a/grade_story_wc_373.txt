<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is clear and rooted in her background, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., refusing the flask). Her final choice to use words over violence is earned by prior causality, though the abstract goal of "capturing the sound of trust breaking" slightly limits interior contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with coherent linkages from investigation to confrontation. Closure lands as Charged Poise with felt cost in the final reflection on trust breaking. Orientation is clear early, and the watch fob persists as a constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (salt, decay) that pressure choices and charge the final image. The pirate market and watch fob constrain tactics and deepen atmosphere through POV-filtered specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (restoring trust) escalate through Lila's agency, culminating in a confrontation that narrows options with visible cost. The resolution is earned by her words and wit, though the escalation is somewhat rapid for the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of trust and betrayal emerges through events and symbols (watch fob, truce of hush) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer, though the final line edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, noir-ish voice and natural dialogue. Perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., fortune-teller's vagueness) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic with high information density, no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, and syntax varies to support pressure, though minor purple phrases appear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh concept of "capturing the sound of trust breaking" and the vivid pirate market setting. Tropes are transformed through specific details, and risk-taking in the abstract goal heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
