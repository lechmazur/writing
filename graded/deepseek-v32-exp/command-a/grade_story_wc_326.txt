<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and drives the plot, with embodied emotions like a quickening heartbeat and tears. However, internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, and the final endurance feels earned but not deeply conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as Elara redefines her existence, with cost felt in her tears and realization. The causal lens holds tightly from death certificate to defragmentation, and the shard constrains tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like the frosted dome and scent of aged wood are selective and purposeful. The porcelain shard and inkblot function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image with reweighted meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's active defragmentation, narrowing options to reveal the ghost, with cost legible in her emotional response. Agency under the causal lens drives the tightening, though the climax relies slightly on revelation rather than a forced trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom from failure emerges organically through the ghost's dialogue and Elara's journey, offering a non-literal answer without moralizing. The final image reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic flourishes like "galaxies in miniature," though dialogue is minimal and elision is taught. Rhythmic control under pressure supports the tone without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied syntax and no loops; figurative language like "forgotten relic" serves clarity and momentum. Peak beats avoid muddle, and the closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes digital ghost and death certificate error with non-obvious ingenuity, transforming tropes through specific details like the porcelain shard. Risk-taking in blending physical and digital elements heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
