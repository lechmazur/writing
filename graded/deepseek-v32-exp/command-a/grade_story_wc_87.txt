<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in scene (e.g., feeling mocked by dawn yet acting). Her motivation to align heart and action intensifies under pressure, and the final endurance is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the melancholic smile.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the final image of her smile and paddling on. The accumulative/textural lens holds, and the utility poles as persistent constraint shape tactics. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details (salt scent, waves) filtered through POV. The utility poles and kayak launch constrain choices and charge the final image, altering navigation tactics without generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative lens, moving from compass failure to pole navigation and final renunciation. Cost is unmistakable in the melancholic smile and foreclosed path, with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of adaptation emerges from particulars like the compass and poles, with subtext in imagery. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through action and smile, avoiding moralizing or thematic echoes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (melancholic yet hopeful). Voice modulates with emotional pressure, and rhythmic control is evident in peaks like the final paddle stroke. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful (e.g., "flicker of hope"), and peak beats avoid muddle or artifact issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality lies in the specific synthesis of navigator tropes through grounded details (poles, compass), feeling organic. Risk-taking is moderate but heightens stakes without gimmickry, though not fully transformative.</comment>
