<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final change is earned, though some internal conflict is summarized rather than simultaneous in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in the Charged Poise of belonging, under an Accumulative/Textural lens that holds. The land's guidance acts as a persistent constraint, and orientation is anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and POV-filtered, with the catacomb orchard and sundial base constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in her emotional journey. One meaningful tightening occurs with the tomb discovery, though stakes remain somewhat internal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical time and rebuilding emerges through particulars like the sundial and mural, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure, though dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or overwriting. Figurative language is purposeful, and closure is clear with no artifacts harming causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of diaspora and spiritual journey feels inevitable, with risk-taking in accumulative structure. Specific details like the catacomb orchard avoid template plots.</comment>
