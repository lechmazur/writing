<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as throwing the stone and reflecting on ripples. His final decision to share insights is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction is subtle. The trait "reads between the lines" is integrated but could show more cost in choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elias gains clarity and purpose, with cost legible in "filled him with a sense of purpose." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with patterns building to the reckoning. Orientation is clear early, and no causality breaks occur.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like mist and light, and the prism atrium constrains choice by pulling Elias inward and charging the final image. Pearl Bay at dawn functions as micro-setting, influencing rituals and atmosphere with purposeful detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens occurs through density increase in patterns and Elias's agency, leading to a decision with cost in his renewed purpose. The dominant stake of illuminating value tightens meaningfully, though external pressure is mild.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images like ripples and light, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to finding meaning in the mundane. Subtext operates through implication, avoiding moralizing, and the ending reweights prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a poetic perceptual signature, controlled rhythm, and no head-hopping. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and elision is purposeful, such as in the reckoning moment, enhancing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, and sentences advance story and atmosphere without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of glazier, prism, and reckonings, with specific details that feel inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, though it leans on familiar themes of meaning.</comment>
