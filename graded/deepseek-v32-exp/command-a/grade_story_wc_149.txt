<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ghost bride's motivation is clear and rooted in embodied emotion; internal conflict between elation and venom is dramatized in key beats like clutching the bead. Micro-choices under pressure, such as kneeling and standing, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final decision to confront collective pain is earned by the bead's awakening and the whispers' arrival, with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise with felt cost—stepping into night with hope and reckoning—under a coherent causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and beats link because/therefore, such as the bead's awakening leading to her realization. The debt constraint shapes tactics throughout, and the final image reconfigures options without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the greenhouse and ancient tree constraining choices and charging the final image. The bead and tree function as micro-settings that pressure decisions, such as burying the bead and its glow illuminating her path. Details are filtered through the ghost's POV, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the causal lens through protagonist agency—the bead's resonance awakens whispers, forcing her to confront collective debt. A meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes the debt is collective, narrowing options and imposing cost. However, the escalation relies slightly on external triggers rather than purely proactive choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of debt and freedom emerge through particulars like the bead and whispers, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration with hope and reckoning, avoiding moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures, such as the bead's venomous connection, and the final image reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature that reflects the ghost's ephemeral nature. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in phrases like "lovingly venomous connection," and any elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent through emotional peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, as in "petrified blossoms" and "resonant awakenings," enhancing momentum. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost lore and alchemical elements feels inevitable, with specific details like the carved bead transforming tropes. Risk-taking in lyrical density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The emotional arc is fresh and grounded in character particulars, avoiding derivative premises.</comment>
