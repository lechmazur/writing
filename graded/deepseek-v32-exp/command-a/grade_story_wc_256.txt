<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her choices, but interiority sometimes leans toward summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final enlightenment is earned through causal accumulation of sounds, with visible cost in her exhaustion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (renewed purpose) under the Accumulative lens, cost legible in "exhausted but enlightened." Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the lens object shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the laboratory and miner's lens constraining choices and charging the final image. Details are purposefully filtered through Elara's POV, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes around connection and progress escalate through accumulated sounds, driven by Elara's agency under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in her deepened understanding and exhaustion, but escalation lacks multiple tight turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through sounds and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer on balance between past and future. Subtext in the lens's symbolism avoids moralizing, though some thematic echoes are present.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, and perceptual signature is consistent. Prose rhythm controls pressure well, and any elision (e.g., sound transitions) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with no loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, and closure image is clear without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept of auditory pilgrimage is fresh and well-integrated, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
