<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clara's motivation as a curator is clear and consistent, driving her actions with embodied emotion. Her micro-choices, like following the locket's urge, reveal values under pressure, and the final purpose is earned through causality. Minor lack of deep internal contradiction prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as Clara reads the letter, realizing the power of listening with felt cost in the courtyard's "sigh." Causal lens holds tightly from locket to mailbox key, and the persistent constraint of the mailbox shapes tactics. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like "blooming jasmine" and "cobblestones" are purposeful, filtered through Clara's POV. The locket and mailbox function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image, integral to the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering the mystery escalates through Clara's agency, such as inserting the key, narrowing options. Cost is legible in the emotional realization at closure, and pressure coheres under the causal lens with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of listening and healing emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the letter's message, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Clara's curated observations. Dialogue with Mrs. Ellis is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Minor rhythmic consistency prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "dawn painted the vibrant courtyard" is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements like the locket and mailbox mystery are synthesized with specificity, feeling organic but not highly original. The concept is well-executed with grounded choices, though it leans on familiar tropes without significant risk-taking.</comment>
