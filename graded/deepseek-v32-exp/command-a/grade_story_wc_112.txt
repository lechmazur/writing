<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to prove time moves sideways is clear and consistent, driving key choices like pulling the lever. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "knuckles whitening"), and her final stance shift to responsibility is earned. However, the "icy warmth" blend feels slightly abstract under peak stress, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with cost (station destabilization, newfound responsibility), and the causal lens holds tightly through because/therefore linkages. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of risk shapes the final image of her ready to face consequences.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the magnetic nexus as a micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image. Sensory details like "bioluminescent creatures" and "cold metal" are filtered through Elara's POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving theory vs. station safety) escalates through protagonist agency under the causal lens, with cost legible in the system failures and stabilization. The lever pull tightens options meaningfully, though the resolution leans slightly on convenient stability recovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge versus responsibility emerges organically from events and images like the nexus's glow, with subtext in "icy warmth." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, but the "subdued awakenings" concept is underutilized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "dance of light and logic" reflecting mechanic's mindset). Voice remains coherent under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., holographic principles) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and density, but minor overwriting occurs (e.g., "icy warmth" and "mechanically warm" verge on decorative repetition). No major artifacts obscure causality, though peak beats show slight register drift in abstract phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise of proving time moves sideways is fresh and well-integrated, with specific details like the magnetic nexus creating inevitability. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though it echoes familiar scientist-dismissed tropes.</comment>
