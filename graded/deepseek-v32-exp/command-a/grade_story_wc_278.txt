<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to hush guilt is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion shown through her weary hands and fixation on the amber. Her internal conflict is dramatized in scene, such as when reading the letters, and her final choice to respond is earned by prior causality. However, some emotional beats rely on summary rather than fully embodied micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot follows a causal chain from guilt to redemption via the letters, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where she learns to listen, costing her old guilt. The hybrid lens (causal and accumulative) holds, and orientation is clear early. The final image of the "meteor hush" legibly conveys cost, though the timeframe element feels underutilized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the laboratory and amber constraining choices and charging the final image through sensory detail filtered through Elara's POV. The amber's glow evolves meaningfully, and spatial choreography is coherent. However, the "folding time" concept is not fully integrated into tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of internal guilt escalates through protagonist agency—finding and responding to the letters—narrowing options and lifting weight with visible cost. Under the hybrid lens, pressure coheres and tightens, though the escalation relies slightly on summary in middle beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of redemption through storytelling emerges organically from particulars like the letters and firmware, with subtext in gestures and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, and the amber's reprise deepens meaning. No thematic echo or drift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature, such as in descriptions of the laboratory. However, minor register drift occurs in peaks (e.g., "meteor hush" feels slightly imposed), and some sentences have repetitive rhythmic patterns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally vivid and propelled, with high information density, but suffers from template cadence in places (e.g., "Her hands, steady yet weary...") and a mixed metaphor in "meteor hush." No major artifacts harm closure, though minor loops reduce momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of tattooist, firmware, and baby cries feels fresh and inevitable, with specific details elevating familiarity. Risk-taking in lyric structure pays off in closure, and emotional specificity avoids templates. No derivative premise or hedging.</comment>
