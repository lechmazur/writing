<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with interiority shown through her skepticism warring with fascination. However, emotions like "quiet awe" are told rather than embodied in peak beats, and internal conflict alternates rather than acts simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing as Elara's realization reweights homecoming; cost is legible in the amber merging and her descent. Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern taught early, and orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the tower and amber constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "wet stone and blooming flowers" are filtered through POV, and spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens is driven by Elara's agency in climbing and discovering, with cost felt in her realization. Dominant stake of understanding homecoming tightens through the ascent and pilgrim encounter, but peak choice lacks a visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events, with subtext in gestures like the silent nod. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, and the amber's reprise reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and controlled under pressure. Minimal dialogue is natural, and elision is taught and paid off, though minor register consistency questions arise in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variation without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, and closure image is clear with no muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of artificial pilgrimage and homecoming, with specific details transforming tropes. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
