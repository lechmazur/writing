<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by personal loss and curiosity. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotions, such as her heart pounding during discovery. However, internal conflict lacks deep contradiction, and the resolution feels earned but somewhat linear, missing the complexity for higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise, reconfiguring stakes with felt cost about memory recovery. Causal lens holds strong with earned linkages from mushrooms to locket to constellations. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraints of past memories shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the greenhouse and shipwrecks constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, integrated into action, such as the fogged glass and glowing mushrooms influencing Elara's decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of memory recovery escalates through Elara's agency, with meaningful tightening as she finds the locket and connects constellations. Cost is legible in the emotional weight of the photograph and note, foreclosing paths under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory and guidance emerges organically through images like mushrooms and constellations, with subtext in the locket's note. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though the note slightly explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct folkloric voice and perceptual signature. Prose rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off, such as in the constellation pattern revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise and vivid with high information density, advancing story momentum. No major loops or scaffolds; minor clichés like "silent sentinel" don't harm closure. Figurative language is purposeful and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of folklore and personal quest feels inevitable, with specific details like the sunken greenhouse transforming tropes. Risk-taking in atmosphere and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
