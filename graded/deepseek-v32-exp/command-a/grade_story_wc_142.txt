<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion like the stone's warmth; however, internal conflict between pride and exhaustion is told more than shown in scene, and her orderly intuitive mind is stated but not deeply tested under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise as the community's resolve crystallizes; cost is felt in the ongoing fight against gentrification, and the causal drive holds strong with coherent because/therefore linkages from the inciting incident to the festival climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "hues of amber and gold," and the raft city pressures choices; the foundation stone chip constrains tactics and charges the final image, though spatial choreography is occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake against gentrification is signaled early; escalation is driven by Lira's agency through decoded graffiti and festival organization, narrowing options under causal lens with visible cost in Vorin's resistance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of community identity emerges organically from graffiti messages and the festival; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the stone's placement without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in descriptions like "patchwork of dreams and desperation"; dialogue from Vorin is natural and goal-driven, but minimal, and voice remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "swirling pattern of symbols" is purposeful, and closure image is clear with no muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of raft city setting and gentrification conflict feels inevitable; tropes are transformed through specific details like graffiti encoding, and emotional truth avoids generic templates with risk-taking in the climax.</comment>
