<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and interiority is present, but emotions are sometimes told rather than shown through embodied contradiction. The final endurance is earned, but lacks deep internal conflict or impulsive shifts under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under an accumulative lens, and the watcher's burden persists as a cost. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds, though the cost could be more visceral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the nocturnal arbor and parachute buckle recurring to charge the final image. The arbor constrains choice through climbing and responsiveness, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with pattern-seeking and revision tightening stakes. Cost is legible in the preservation of trust and the enduring burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through imagery and events, but the ending has slight moralizing in "the strength to carry the burden with grace," reducing subtextual resonance. Otherwise, it invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with a consistent perceptual signature and no head-hopping. POV is stable, and the prose rhythm supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lush and rhythmic but occasionally overwritten with dense figurative language, though no major loops or artifacts harm clarity. Momentum is maintained despite some purple tendencies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept is original and synthesized inevitably, with poetic risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The pattern seeker and arbor create a fresh angle.</comment>
