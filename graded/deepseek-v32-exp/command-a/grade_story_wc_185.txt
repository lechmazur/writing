<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative, but interiority lacks depth; emotions are described rather than embodied with contradictory impulses. The final choice is earned through causality, but no visible cost or internal conflict is dramatized on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the bloom of hush unfurling and silencing the storm, a resonant reconfiguration under the causal lens; cost is legible in Lira's weariness and the stone's silence. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and integrated into action, with the harmonic caves and ice patterns constraining choices and charging the final image. The environment pressures tactics through luminous details and spatial coherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled, and escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the causal lens, culminating in the bloom's activation with visible cost. Pressure tightens meaningfully through her conjuring and the storm's threat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of balance emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in the caves' song and silence; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though it lacks profound complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature filtered through Lira's focus; prose rhythm supports pressure, and no head-hopping or elision issues arise, though dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and concise, with high information density and no loops or scaffolds; minor overwriting in descriptive passages doesn't harm clarity or closure, and propulsion remains strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of magical elements like the bloom of hush and echo chamber stone, transforming tropes through specific details; risk-taking is moderate, with coherence but no groundbreaking innovation.</comment>
