<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila's motivation to honor overlooked histories is clear and consistent, driving her actions from start to closure. Her backstory with the lighthouse anchors her choices, and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., deciphering the painting) reveal her values. The final renunciation of the fragment's purpose is earned with visible cost in the whispering gratitude and her smile, though internal contradiction is subtle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with Lila reclaiming stories and the fragment's glow fading, a resonant reconfiguration under the causal lens. Causality is tight: fragment → painting symbol → map → tower, with cost legible in the "weight of untold stories." Orientation is clear early, and the lens fragment persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details (copper scent, burnt sage) and spatial coherence. The lens fragment and tower environment constrain choices and charge the final image, guiding Lila's path. POV filtering is strong, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes in honoring histories escalate through Lila's agency: finding the symbol, map, and tower under the causal lens. Cost is unmistakable in her effort and the fragment's fulfillment. One meaningful tightening occurs when the map narrows options to the tower, foreclosing other paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of intuition and remembrance emerges organically through symbols and actions, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with Lila's readiness, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in whispers and murals, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled ("symphony of whispers"). Rhythmic modulation supports pressure, and elision (e.g., childhood memories) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion is strong, with no muddle obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes fantasy and emotional truth with originality: between-worlds translator and lighthouse lens feel fresh and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific details like hidden paintings. Risk-taking in lyric tone heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
