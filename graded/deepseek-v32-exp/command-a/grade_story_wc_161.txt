<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve lost songs is clear and intensifies, compelling her choices. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotions, such as clutching the meteorite chip. The final shift to writing truths is earned, though minor abstraction in "blooming and withering" slightly weakens peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration as Elara realizes the dust is a map, rediscovering songs with felt cost. The accumulative lens holds, with pattern density increasing meaningfully. Orientation is clear early, and causality remains intact without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the attic and dust motes constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's POV, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake in preserving songs escalates through Elara's agency after the letter, leading to renewed mapping and personal transformation. Cost is legible in her rediscovery, under the accumulative lens with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of balance and rediscovery emerges organically through images like the meteorite and dust, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Elara's symphony of loss and renewal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, and perceptual signature is consistent. No head-hopping; prose rhythm controls pressure well, though absence of dialogue limits evaluation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without artifacts. Minor overwriting in phrases like "blooming and withering" doesn't harm clarity or closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements synthesize organically, with specific details transforming tropes. The dust map realization provides a fresh inflection, and emotional truth avoids generic templates, though not fully groundbreaking.</comment>
