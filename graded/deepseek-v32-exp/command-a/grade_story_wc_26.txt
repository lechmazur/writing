<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her trait as a dusk noticer and drive to uncover forgotten history. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion in moments like "a surge of luminous regret." The final choice to metamorphose the shadow is earned by prior causality, though internal conflict is underdeveloped, lacking contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), reconfiguring Elara's purpose with felt sorrow and hope. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through descriptive density to the transformation. Orientation is clear early, and the shadow's materialization tightens options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with the library, archives, and river stone constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's POV, such as the "scent of aged paper and forgotten dreams." The stone's use in the climax reinforces its narrative weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the accumulative lens through Elara's agency, from observing footage to actively transforming the shadow. Cost is legible in her "luminous regret" and the sculpture's creation, foreclosing other paths. The dominant stake of uncovering truth tightens with each beat, driven by her decisions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, exploring memory, loss, and hope without moralizing. Subtext operates through the shadow as collective fears and the river stone's symbolism. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the sculpture, reweighting prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature reflecting Elara's sharp-eyed nature. Voice modulates with emotional pressure, evident in phrases like "softly deliberate decision." No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, and the prose rhythm supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet clear, with high information density and varied rhythm. No significant artifacts, loops, or scaffold; figurative language is controlled and serves the climax. Sentences advance story and atmosphere, such as "the shadow began to change" propelling the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The concept synthesizes fresh elements—library above clouds, shareable dreams, shadow unbound—with specificity and emotional truth. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, like the shadow's manifestation as collective regret. Risk-taking in lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
