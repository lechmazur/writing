<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and drives the plot, but secondary characters (Mira, Jorin, Lira) are functional without depth, reducing interior complexity. Elara's altruism is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The final collective effort is earned, but lacks micro-choices under pressure for full credibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly with clear linkages from message to restoration. Closure is a decisive change (nebula returns) with felt cost (Elara fades), and the bell's loss as a persistent constraint shapes tactics. Orientation is anchored early within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details (scent of trees, hum of arches) that charge the final image of the nebula's return. The garden's overgrowth and floating arches constrain choices during the restoration effort, integrating environment with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring the nebula) escalates through protagonist agency (Kael gathering allies, clearing garden). Cost is legible in Elara's fading and the collective effort, foreclosing other paths. One meaningful tightening occurs when the bell rings, reweighting options under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of collective hope emerges organically from events (strangers becoming family, garden renewal) without moralizing. The ending image of blooming orchids offers a resonant, non-literal answer to restoration, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable with lyrical prose, but perceptual signature lacks distinctness under peak pressure. Dialogue is minimal but natural; no head-hopping. Voice is consistent, though could heighten rhythm in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with varied rhythm and high information density (e.g., "waterfall of stars"). No loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful. Minor overwriting in early descriptions ("brambled hope") but clarity remains in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost, orchard planet, and collective restoration feels inevitable, with specific details (floating arches, chalk messages) avoiding cliché. Risk-taking in tone and setting heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
