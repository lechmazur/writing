<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her actions with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. However, the characterization lacks deep internal contradiction or flaw-driven mistakes, and her steadfast resolve minimizes struggle, preventing the highest band. The final endurance is earned but feels slightly one-dimensional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise with felt cost in the tenuous absolution, under a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens. The plaque discovery confirms her quest, and orientation is clear early. Persistent constraints of decay shape tactics, and cost is legible in "It was fragile, this feeling."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and POV-filtered, with sensory details like "damp earth" and "fading blooms" woven into action. The plaque and bread function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding sacred in ordinary escalates under the Accumulative lens through Elara's agency in gardening and discoveries. Cost is unmistakable in the fragility of absolution, and the uncovering of the plaque deepens stakes with a meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the bread and plaque, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the conceptual repricing of the ordinary, reweighting prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Elara's noticing. Voice is lyrical and consistent, with rhythmic control under pressure and no head-hopping. Purposeful elision in reflection is anchored and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops, scaffold, or overwriting. Figurative language is purposeful, and sentences advance story seamlessly, as in the plaque uncovering beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of guerrilla gardening and mystical elements feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the quiet, lyrical approach. Specific details like the vanished bakery bread transform familiar tropes, heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
