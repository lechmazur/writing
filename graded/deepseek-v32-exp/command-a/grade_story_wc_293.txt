<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Bridge-Song's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices that reveal character, though the trait "dynamically observant" is sometimes told rather than fully shown in deep conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Bridge-Song crosses the gateway, with felt cost in the journey; causal lens holds tight with because/therefore linkages from clue to discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the mountain pullout and wilderness guiding choices; the glass flake as micro-setting object constrains tactics and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency under causal lens, from initial clue to wilderness journey, with cost legible in the effort; one meaningful tightening occurs when the glass flake aligns with the landscape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of possibility from "never" emerges organically through images and actions, with subtext in gestures like the scaffold wrap flutters; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature; prose reflects Bridge-Song's observant nature, though occasional ornate phrasing doesn't harm clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffolds; figurative language is purposeful and consistent, though "luminous disbelief" edges toward purple without muddling sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements like the glass flake and pixelated amnesty feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in abstract concepts heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
