<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion in key moments like her "heart pounding with fear and exhilaration." However, internal conflict is more descriptive than dramatized in scene, and micro-choices under pressure lack depth, limiting full characterization impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise with legible cost in Lira's mixed fear and readiness, under a coherent accumulative lens. The archway's glow and astrolabe's trembling charge the final image, and orientation is clear early, meeting high standards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details like the "cold brass" astrolabe and aurora's song integrated into action. The archway functions as micro-setting, constraining choice by shifting and glowing to charge the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early, and escalation under the accumulative lens occurs through density increases like the aurora's swelling song and archway's glow, driven by Lira's agency in tracing stars. Cost is felt in her emotional state, though no major reversal narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of freeing creativity emerges organically from cosmic imagery and Lira's longing, with subtext in the aurora's song and unspoken words. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through her readiness to follow the stars, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a poetic, cosmic perceptual signature. Rhythm controls pressure well, and elision like the "unwritten calendar" is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and density, but minor overwriting in phrases like "shadowed rapture" slightly muddles peak beats. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion remains clear, and closure image is undimmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of cosmic creativity and personal longing, with specific details like the astrolabe and aurora transforming familiar tropes. Emotional truth feels inevitable, and risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
