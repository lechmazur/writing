<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "reflect light into dark corners" is clear and consistently drives her actions, such as descending to meet the lockmaster. However, her internal conflict is minimal, and the lockmaster's characterization remains functional but underdeveloped, lacking contradictory impulses that would elevate the score. The final choice to return the tooth feels earned but without significant cost or struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the exchange of the tooth, creating a felt cost of vulnerability and connection. The accumulative/textural lens holds, reinforced by motifs like the "quivering hush," but the plot lacks a persistent constraint shaping tactics. Orientation is clear within the first 120 words, avoiding penalties.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like "luminous harbor" and "lanterns strung along the docks," contributing to atmosphere. However, the environment does not actively constrain choices or charge the final image beyond mood, failing the 9+ test where micro-setting must alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes center on Elara's desire for connection, escalating through her decision to descend the fire escape, driven by agency. Under the accumulative lens, this tightens options, but the cost is muted—gaining a kindred spirit without a visible trade-off or foreclosed path, limiting higher-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of finding light in darkness emerges organically through concrete actions and the final image of shared understanding, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material, such as the tooth's meaning, with resonant subtext, though it leans slightly toward tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature, and dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. The voice remains consistent under pressure, with purposeful elision (e.g., the lockmaster's past) that pays off in closure, though minor convergence in emotional peaks occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures and clear propulsion, though occasional phrases like "wistfully pragmatic" edge toward label-speak. No major artifacts or loops obscure causality; figurative language is cohesive and supports the closure image without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of gardener and lockmaster roles feels fresh and inevitable, transforming familiar tropes through specific details like the bitting gauge tooth. However, risk-taking is moderate, and the emotional arc, while sincere, does not subvert expectations or introduce bold structural innovations.</comment>
