<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's cool-headedness and motivation are clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation is earned, but minor abstractness in emotional transliteration prevents higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (earned stasis) and felt cost under accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and structure is coherent with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (e.g., garden's silence guides Kael) and charges the final image with sensory specificity. Environment is integral to stakes and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under accumulative lens, with cost legible in the restoration of harmony. Dominant stake is clear and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in silence and echoes deepens reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though minor poetic density may slightly obscure immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, but slight overwriting in figurative language near peak beats causes minor clarity drag without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers fresh synthesis of elements with specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
