<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's interior contradiction (amoral facade vs. secret sentimentality) is concrete and drives her actions; her trembling hands and emotional weight at closure show embodied cost, earning the redemption arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the rain nourishes the earth, reconfiguring meaning with felt cost; causal lens holds from her guilt to the egg's release, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Salt flat setting constrains choice (cracks guide her path) and charges the final image (damp earth); sensory details like "shimmered like a cracked mirror" are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens, from following the map to planting the egg; cost is legible in her risk and emotional release, though stakes could be more visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of redemption emerges through particulars like the egg and drought without moralizing; the final image of rain offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior destruction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm and diction reflect Elara's mindset under pressure, though minor register consistency could be tighter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "earth shimmered like a cracked mirror" is coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of amoral philanthropist and extinction themes feels inevitable; risk-taking in character complexity heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
