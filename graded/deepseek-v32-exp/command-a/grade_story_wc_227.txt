<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices like aligning the charm. However, internal contradiction is subtle rather than sharply contradictory impulses in scene, preventing the highest band. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, but the lack of strong conflicting desires limits the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the statue's glow reconfigures meaning, with cost legible when the workshop shudders and Elara clutches the charm. The hybrid drive lens (causal and accumulative) holds, with persistent constraints like the acid sea shaping tactics. Orientation is clear early, and the ending reweights prior material without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The gears-and-cogs workshop and acid sea pressure choices through sensory details like hissing waves and groaning gears, constraining Elara's actions. The statue and key ring charm charge the final image by glowing and revealing memories, fulfilling the 9+ test. Specificity is purposeful, with no generic placeholder setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the hybrid lens, from narrating findings to aligning the charm, forcing a trade-off with cost when the workshop protests. The dominant stake of personal meaning tightens through one meaningful deepening that reweights options. Cost is unmistakable in the climax's chaos and calming.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of kintsugi emerges through events and images like the pockmarked statue, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, such as the charm's reunion charging brokenness as strength. The final image reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Elara's biased noticing of rust and grooves. Voice modulates with pressure, though minor register drift occurs in phrases like "dire enchantment." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with clear propulsion in beats like the charm clicking into place. Minor artifacts include paraphrase loops (e.g., "conjure meaning" reiterated) and template cadence in emotional peaks, but no closure obscurity. Figurative language is generally coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of steampunk setting, kintsugi theme, and memory repair feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the hybrid structure. Specific details like the acid sea and pockmarks transform tropes through grounded choices. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, and the closure image is uniquely charged.</comment>
