<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and drives the plot, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. However, internal contradiction is mild, and the final choice, while earned, lacks deep visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change under a causal lens, but the cost is only lightly felt in the key's heaviness. Structure fits mosaic track with legible transitions, though orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the edge of the isle for the climax. Sensory details are purposeful and integrated with POV, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are well-signaled and escalate through protagonist agency, with a meaningful tightening at the void revelation. Cost is legible in the effort of relearning and the key's dormant state.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and symbols, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext in the key and shadows avoids moralizing, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a scholarly tone and perceptual signature. No head-hopping; prose rhythm supports pressure, though no dialogue is present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is clear and concise with good information density, varied syntax, and no major loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "spoons bent reality" fits without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in a fresh synthesis of elements, transforming tropes with specific details. However, it lacks bold risk-taking, staying coherent but not groundbreaking.</comment>
