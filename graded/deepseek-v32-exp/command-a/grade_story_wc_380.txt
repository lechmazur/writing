<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and personal, driving the narrative with embodied emotion, but lacks deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses under pressure. The final understanding is earned, but the cost is minimally felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a decisive change with implied cost under a causal lens, and orientation is clear early. However, the cost is not heavily dramatized, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber is vividly described and essential, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, but the score is capped due to Q2 not reaching 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation is driven by Eli's agency, with a legible cost in his journey. The causal lens holds, but the conflict resolution lacks intense pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and imagery, with a resonant, non-literal ending. Subtext is handled well, but it leans slightly abstract without deeper complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, lyrical voice and consistent perceptual signature. No dialogue, but prose rhythm supports pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid with no loops or artifacts, and figurative language enhances clarity. Rhythm varies naturally, but the score is capped due to Q2 not reaching 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes unique elements organically, with originality in the combination of motifs. Risk-taking in the magical realism approach heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
