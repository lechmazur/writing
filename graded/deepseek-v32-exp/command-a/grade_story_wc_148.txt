<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority and a earned change from chasing hush to seeking truth. The final choice is motivated by the journal's revelation, showing contradictory impulses in scene. Minor hairline slip in the quickness of the epiphany, but closure is untouched.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change from silence to truth, under a causal lens that holds throughout. The cost is legible in the urgency of "before they found the bodies" and the reconfiguration of his identity. Orientation is anchored early, and structure is coherent with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "copperlight repose" and the lattice constraining choices during descent. However, the environment doesn't fully charge the final image, as the lighthouse's role diminishes at closure, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clear with redemption vs. doom, escalating through the journal discovery that forces a choice. Agency drives the escalation under the causal lens, and cost is felt in the risk of the bodies being found. One meaningful tightening is sufficient and well-executed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of truth vs. silence emerges organically from events, with subtext in the lattice's whispers. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though it leans slightly toward declaration in "he was Elias, the boy who chased truth."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Elias's biased noticing of the lattice and copperlight. Voice is consistent and poetic, with no head-hopping. Elision is taught and paid off in the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean with high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "copperlight repose" is purposeful and consistent. No clarity issues in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of the "boy who cried wolf" legend with a Gothic setting, transformed through specific details like the lattice and journal. Turns feel earned, and risk-taking in structure coheres without gimmickry.</comment>
