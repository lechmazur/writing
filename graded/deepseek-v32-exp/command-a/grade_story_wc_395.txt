<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and drives the plot, with her "brightly attentive" attribute shown through pattern-noticing. However, interiority lacks deep contradictory impulses in scene, and emotional embodiment is occasionally told (e.g., "Elara felt a sensed absence") rather than fully dramatized under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly with logical progression from investigation to closure. Orientation is clear early, and closure lands with a decisive change (decision to expose truth) and felt cost (risking her position). The persistent constraint of the company cover-up shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (social network archive) and objects (patch, numbers) are integral, constraining choices like bypassing security and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (finding truth) escalate meaningfully under causal lens through Elara's agency (lying, bypassing security). Cost is legible in her decision to face consequences, and one tightening (discovering coordinates) forecloses options and reweights the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (truth vs. corporate silence) emerges coherently from events and images without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of Elara stepping out, but it leans slightly toward declaration rather than pure implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (professional, pattern-oriented). Voice remains consistent under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., data purged) is taught and paid off. No dialogue on page, so internal voice coherence is key.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive with high information density. No significant loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; rhythm varies naturally. Minor telling in emotional beats (e.g., "Elara's heart raced") but does not harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes corporate archiving and space mystery with originality, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure (investigation unfolding) heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specific details (e.g., "Echo-7") avoid template plots.</comment>
