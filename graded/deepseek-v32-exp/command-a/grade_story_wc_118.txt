<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and drives the plot, with interiority shown through actions like tracing the tapestry. However, the attribute "sensitively perceptive" is stated repetitively rather than demonstrated through embodied choices, slightly reducing depth. The final choice is earned through causal progression, but lacks internal contradiction or complex flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the ritual restoring dreams, and cost is legible in "the weight of centuries pressing upon her." The causal lens holds tightly from tapestry to diaries to scrolls to ritual, with orientation clear early. The displaced axis acts as a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like "bronze quiet" and the silo library's transformation charges the final image. The environment constrains choices by housing key artifacts and the altar, though spatial pressure is subtle. Details are filtered through Elara's POV, avoiding exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (restoring dreams) and escalate through Elara's agency under the causal lens, from probing the tapestry to performing the ritual. Cost is felt in the energy and weight during the climax, narrowing options meaningfully. No coincidental resolutions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from symbols like dragons and the displaced axis, with subtext in the tapestry's role. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the world dreaming again, without moralizing. However, some thematic elements are slightly explicit in diaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature biased toward historical obsession. No head-hopping; prose rhythm supports urgency, though dialogue is absent. Elision in discoveries is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and dense, but repetitive use of "sensitively perceptive" creates a template cadence (-0.4 deduction). Figurative language like "bronze quiet" is coherent, and closure remains clear, though minor overwriting occurs in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise feels fresh with a non-obvious synthesis of post-dream decay and medieval symbolism. Specific details like the silo library and tapestry transformation avoid tropes. Risk-taking in the conceptual framework heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
