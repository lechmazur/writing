<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion in her ache and the figure's weeping, but she lacks internal conflict or flaws, making her somewhat one-dimensional; the final choice to release the soul is earned but without contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as the figure dissolves and the tooth is spent, under a causal lens that holds; orientation is clear early, but the resolution is straightforward without significant twists.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Echo Gorge is vividly atmospheric with sensory details like whispers and jagged rock, but it doesn't heavily constrain choices; the harp and tooth as micro-settings charge the final image more directly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes around healing are clear, and escalation is driven by Elara's agency in pursuing and playing the harp, with cost in the emotional release; however, the conflict resolves easily without deep tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of healing and integration emerges through actions and images like the boy's laughter, with a resonant ending that reweights prior material without moralizing; subtext is present in the confession.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, and dialogue feels natural; no head-hopping, and perceptual signature is consistent, though slightly overly poetic at times.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with good rhythm and density, but phrases like "luminous ache" edge toward purple without harming clarity; no major loops or artifacts, though minor poetic excess exists.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept of a soul collector with a misaligned harp is fresh and well-integrated, transforming tropes with emotional specificity; synthesis feels inevitable, but risk-taking is moderate.</comment>
