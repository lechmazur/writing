<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zara's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as touching the crystal. Her internal conflict and earned change are well-demonstrated, though minor abstract moments prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Zara embraces her journey, with cost legible in the final image. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, and orientation is clear early on.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The floating observatory and geode crystals constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details filtered through Zara's POV. The environment actively shapes her tactics and realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Zara's agency under the accumulative lens, with stakes tightening through her interactions with the crystals. Cost is visible in her realization, though the escalation is more internal than external.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the geode symbolizing resilience, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext is handled through implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice remains consistent, and purposeful elision (e.g., perturbation theory) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no major artifacts or loops. Figurative language is purposeful, and sentence rhythm supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of trauma, crystals, and perturbation theory feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in structure that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
