<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies with the slide's discovery; her orderly nature clashes with urgency, showing internal conflict. The final renewed purpose is earned through causal events, with cost in her transformed role. Embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure strengthen characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara carries the light forward, with felt cost in her deepened purpose. Causal lens holds tightly from discovery to transformation. Orientation is clear early, and the slide's change drives a decisive shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the frozen library and slides constraining choices (e.g., gloves for cold) and charging the final image. Sensory details like "crystalline shelves" and "misty breath" integrate with action, reflecting POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving meaning) escalates through Elara's agency in examining the slide, leading to a tightening of purpose. Cost is legible in the slide's transformation and her renewed urgency, under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of meaning and legacy emerges implicitly from vows and the slide's message, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through "carry the light forward," reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice ("quartz hush"); perceptual signature is consistent, though minor purple phrasing occurs. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and high density without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "silence hung like a quartz hush" is coherent and advances atmosphere, with clear propulsion in key beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of frozen library, magic slides, and vows feels inevitable, with specific details elevating familiarity. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure is charged.</comment>
