<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in folklore, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as prodding the speck and building monuments. Her transformation is earned through causality, with visible cost in her shifted purpose. However, minor passivity in early beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Elara's transformation, under a causal lens that holds throughout. The moonstone speck acts as a persistent constraint, shaping tactics and the final image. Orientation is clear within the first 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details filtered through Elara's POV. The moonstone speck and seeds function as micro-settings that pressure decisions. Specificity is high and purposeful, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the causal lens through Elara's agency, from discovering the speck to researching folklore, with cost legible in her transformation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the whispers reveal the speck's significance, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the monuments and whispers, offering a non-literal answer to purpose and forgotten truths.

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic and consistent, with Elara's bias shaping narration. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
