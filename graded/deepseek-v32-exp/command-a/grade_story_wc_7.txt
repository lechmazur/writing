<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her from doubt to action; her interiority is concrete with embodied emotions, such as when she brushes the soil and feels tingling during the alignment. The final choice to eat the fruit is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in her transformation and hope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Elara eats the fruit and gains hope, under a causal lens that holds throughout; cost is felt in her effort and the greenhouse's transformation. Orientation is clear early, and the celestial alignment persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse constrains choices (e.g., pruning) and charges the final image of renewal; sensory details like "patches of rust" and "glowing faintly" are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens, from planting to doubt to pruning, with cost legible in her emotional journey and the physical transformation; the dominant stake of inspiring rebellion tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events like pruning and growth, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to creating beauty from ruins without moralizing; subtext operates in gestures and symbols, such as the knowledge fruit embodying hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "her fingers brushing the soil gently"; voice is poetic yet consistent, and elision (like the grandmother's wisdom) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or artifacts; rhythm varies naturally, e.g., "The greenhouse creaked as the wind picked up," and figurative language is purposeful without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes memory-tasting, knowledge fruit, and gentle rebellion with specificity and risk-taking; the closure feels inevitable in hindsight, and emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
