<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, but lacks embodied emotion and internal contradiction in scene; actions are told rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure, reducing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with felt cost (pride and accomplishment) under a causal lens; orientation is clear early, and the plot progresses with coherent cause-and-effect linkages to the decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly described with sensory detail, but the library and grotto serve more as atmospheric backdrop than constraining choices or charging the final image directly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation is driven by Elias's agency, but the conflict is low-stakes with mild cost; one meaningful tightening occurs, yet lacks high-pressure reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of quiet rebellion emerges through events and images without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the forest of contemplation metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice; no head-hopping, and perceptual signature is consistent, though dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and purposeful, but minor overwriting and repetitive phrases (e.g., "amplified quiet") create slight momentum drag without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Concept of a humble rebellion through window displays is fresh and organic, with specific details, but not fully transformative or risk-taking in execution.</comment>
