<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing grooves and comparing videos. Her shielded openness provides subtle internal conflict, and the final excavation is earned by prior causality. However, her competence borders on perfection, lacking significant struggle or contradictory impulses in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—the discovery of the chapel—and cost is legible in Elara's reverence and the frescoes' glow. The causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages, from video comparison to excavation. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the henge's misalignment acts as a persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The rain-scoured fresco vault and ancient henge are vividly described with sensory detail and constrain choices, charging the final image. The environment pressures Elara's discovery through the henge's shift and the vault's endurance. However, sensory diversity is slightly limited, leaning heavily on visual and tactile elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency under the causal lens, from curiosity to excavation, with cost felt in her effort and emotional weight. The dominant stake—uncovering the truth—is signaled early and tightens through the video discrepancy. No major reversals, but one meaningful deepening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from silence and empathy, reweighted by the final image of the glowing frescoes without moralizing. Subtext operates in the chapel's whispers and Elara's reverence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to bridging known and unknown, though it leans slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Elara's methodical curiosity and the prose's rhythmic control. No head-hopping or register drift. The voice is consistent under pressure, though dialogue is absent, limiting evaluation of naturalism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise and vivid with varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "rain-scoured fresco vault" is purposeful and coherent. Minor overwriting in phrases like "hum with secrets" does not harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise offers a fresh synthesis of a map framer using silent videos to uncover a chapel, transformed through specific details and emotional truth. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without gimmickry. It feels inevitable in hindsight, though not radically innovative.</comment>
