<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to understand the "cartography of scars" is clear and intensifies under pressure, driving the decision to open the envelope. Interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., "trembling hands" and "furiously tranquil gaze," with micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values. The final choice to write is earned by prior causality, foreclosing the path of censorship with visible cost in confronting past scars. Minor abstraction in "rarefy" moment slightly limits peak emotional specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with Elara's clarity and decision to write, reconfiguring purpose under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in "fear, hope, regret, all dissolving into a singular clarity." Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The persistent constraint of scars shapes the final image, ensuring coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail, e.g., "stormlit observatory" and "ticking timer," mirroring internal states and constraining choices. The observatory's isolation and storm's fury charge the final image, while objects like the envelope function as micro-setting. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details are filtered through Elara's POV. Economy of detail supports momentum without clutter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict between silence and revelation) escalates under the Accumulative lens through density increases, e.g., storm intensity and timer rhythm. Agency drives escalation via Elara's decision to open the envelope, narrowing options with cost in emotional clarity. One meaningful tightening occurs, foreclosing the path of censorship. Coincidence is absent; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth and self-confrontation emerges organically through events like the map of scars, with subtext in symbols (timer, envelope). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in Elara's uncensored writing, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Epiphanies are earned through specific struggle, though the final line slightly edges toward explicit statement. Complexity embraces ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, lyrical prose ("storm-kissed wonder"). Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and elision (e.g., envelope contents) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction remains within Elara's lexicon. Rhythmic control under pressure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language ("cartography of scars") is consistent and purposeful, though minor density in peak beats slightly limits propulsion. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and clarity is maintained throughout. Final image is charged without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of poet-as-cartographer, with tropes transformed through specific details like the map of scars. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, and risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes. However, the premise is not fully groundbreaking, limiting the score. Integration feels organic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
