<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and credible internal conflict driving his epiphany. His final choice to reverse his approach is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his renewed purpose. However, some emotional states are summarized rather than fully dramatized, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Plot follows causal linkages from argument to doubt to epiphany, with closure as a decisive change—Elias's reversal—landing with felt cost. The causal lens holds throughout, and orientation is clear early, with the ethical dilemma persistently shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the radar dome and story stick constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through POV, mirroring internal states without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes around ethical storytelling escalate through Elias's agency, with a meaningful tightening as he reverses his method. Cost is legible in his renewed clarity and effort, though escalation is somewhat linear under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and symbols, with subtext in gestures like tracing the stick. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, but lacks profound ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice fitting the character; no head-hopping. Diction is consistent, though slightly elevated in peak beats, and perceptual signature is clear.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied rhythm and no major loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is purposeful, but minor purpleness (e.g., "meteor hush") doesn't harm clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and synthesized organically, with specific details transforming tropes. Turns feel earned, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes, though not groundbreaking.</comment>
