<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation to uncover hidden truths is clear and consistent, driving her investigation and final intervention. Her internal conflict between regret and devotion is embodied in micro-choices, such as recalibrating the telescope, with visible cost. However, the "orbits of regret" concept remains slightly abstract, limiting deeper contradiction in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with logical progression from the journalist's call to Eleanor's climactic recalibration. Closure lands as a decisive change with felt cost in her peace amidst chaos. The observatory's misuse is uncovered through her agency, though the journalist's disappearance is a minor convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the observatory's misaligned telescopes constraining Eleanor's choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like the "echoing halls" and "glass dome" are integrated into action, though some descriptions lean generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from curiosity to exposing a sinister scheme, driven by Eleanor's agency under the causal lens. Cost is legible when she risks vanishing like the journalist and recalibrates the telescope, narrowing options. The confrontation with the director is brief but effective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of truth and redemption emerges through particulars like the rosewood pen nib and recalibration, offering a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext in symbols avoids moralizing, though "orbits of regret" is occasionally over-relied upon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, with Eleanor's observant nature filtering perception. Dialogue with the director is natural and goal-driven, but tonal shifts like "solemn playfulness" are not fully sustained under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally concise and vivid, with varied rhythm and few artifacts. Minor issues include slightly strained metaphors ("orbits of regret") and underdeveloped tone, but clarity and momentum are maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of heiress investigator and observatory setting, transformed through specific details like the pen nib. Emotional specificity avoids cliché, but it lacks risk-taking that would heighten stakes further.</comment>
