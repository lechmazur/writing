<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion shown through actions like brushing cold stone and tears streaming. Her micro-choices under pressure, such as following the path and painting on fog, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of gallery art for fog-based expression is earned with visible cost in her emotional shift, though internal contradiction is mild.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong, building through discoveries to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lira's joy returns with cost felt in tears and lightness. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality links fresco to film to network without breaks. The film as a persistent constraint shapes tactics, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with fog and ruins guiding choices like revealing the path and serving as canvas. Sensory details (cold stone, damp earth) are filtered through Lira's POV, and the environment constrains her actions, charging the closure. However, reliance on visual senses slightly limits full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rediscovering joy escalates under accumulative lens through Lira's agency in finding film and using the network. Cost is legible in her tears and renewed purpose, foreclosing her prior artistic path. One meaningful tightening occurs as projected images deepen her realization, though external conflict is minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of art preserving moments emerges organically from particulars like the fresco and film, with subtext in light-painting blending with projected joy. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, but the epiphany ("art had never truly been about pigments") leans slightly explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, as Lira's poetic voice filters setting through her artistic lens. No dialogue, but prose rhythm and syntax control under pressure, such as in the climax, are effective. Purposeful elision in time fluidity is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language ("fold of a daydream") is coherent and voice-motivated. Minor overwriting in phrases like "whispering secrets" does not harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of light-painting, ruined district, and film projection feels inevitable, with specific details like luminescent pigments enriching the arc. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though the artist-block theme is familiar.</comment>
