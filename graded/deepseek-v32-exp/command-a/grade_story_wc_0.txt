<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. The final understanding of transformation is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her humility. Slight tidiness in the epiphany prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with the butterfly's emergence, a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights meaning with felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with patterns building to a decisive change. Orientation is clear early, and constraints shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse is a vivid micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's POV, with decay mirroring internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens, with stakes in understanding transformation. Cost is legible in the gradual change leading to the butterfly, foreclosing prior paths with reverence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of gradual change emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in the dust's behavior. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the butterfly symbol, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending scientific and reflective tones. Prose has rhythmic control, and any elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and clear propulsion. No loops or scaffolds; figurative language is consistent. Minor overwriting in peaks prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of neutron star decay and butterfly dust is fresh and non-obvious, transforming tropes through specific choices. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
