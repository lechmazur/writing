<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in personal loss, with embodied emotion and credible endurance. However, the absence of contradictory impulses in scene prevents higher scoring, as the 9+ test requires internal conflict acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost from collective pain and personal loss, under a consistent accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the factory ruins serve as a persistent constraint shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the lavender field and factory ruins charging the final image by symbolizing resilience and healing. The environment constrains Elara's choices and enhances thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes in transmuting pain are signaled early and escalate through Elara's agency in arranging photographs, with cost legible in her emotional journey. Under the accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, though external conflict is minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of collective healing emerges organically through images and actions, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the lavender field's whisper, but occasional overt echoes prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature reflecting Elara's calm demeanor. No head-hopping or dialogue issues, and rhythmic control supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is elegant and purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. No significant loops or scaffolds, though slight purpleness in peaks prevents a top score, but clarity is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept of a puzzle archivist transmuting pain is fresh and well-executed with specific details, but it leans on familiar tropes of memory healing without full transformation, limiting ingenuity.</comment>
