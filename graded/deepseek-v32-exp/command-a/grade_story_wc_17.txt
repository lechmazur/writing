<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in family legacy, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., sifting through diaries, following the map) revealing hierarchy of values. Interiority is concrete through embodied perception, though some emotional responses edge toward stock phrasing. Final choice to accept purpose is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as she realizes the walls dream of being remembered, reconfiguring her purpose with felt cost. Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from discoveries to revelation. Orientation is anchored early, and persistent constraint of legacy shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the ivy-veiled passage constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details (e.g., moss-covered stones, humidity) are filtered through POV, and the environment actively guides the protagonist's actions toward the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens, with stakes tightening through her discoveries of diaries and film strip. Cost is legible in her trembling and the burden transforming into purpose. One meaningful deepening changes knowledge and forecloses prior paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of legacy and memory emerges organically from events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the mirror revelation. Subtext operates in the diaries and film strip, avoiding moralizing. Earned epiphany reweights prior material without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic diction and rhythm that heightens pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., the glimpsed flicker) is taught and paid off. Voice remains coherent under stress, though minor register consistency issues exist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting in phrases like "ivy seemed to watch her" causes slight figurative muddle, but no major loops or artifacts obscure closure. Clarity and momentum are maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of cartography and intangible echoes, transformed through specific details like the film strip and diaries. Risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids templates, and closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
