<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and credible endurance. The poet's shyly unstoppable nature drives choices, and the final transformation is earned, though some interiority leans abstract without full contradiction in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—the poet finds harmony, and her songs become universal. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early, with the shell's role shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell constrains choice and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details woven into action. It functions as a micro-setting that pressures the poet's actions and mirrors her internal state, supporting the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the poet's agency under the Accumulative lens, with cost legible in her persistent work and transformation. The dominant stake of transforming pain into beauty tightens through her choices, though the escalation is subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with the blossom armistice offering a resonant, non-literal answer to pain and beauty. Subtext operates through the postcard and shell, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control. Elision is taught and paid off, and the perceptual signature is consistent, though minor overwriting occurs without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no major loops or artifacts harming closure. Some figurative language borders on overwriting but remains purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of elements, with risk-taking in lyrical style and emotional specificity. The core premise is transformed through grounded details, though themes are familiar but well-executed.</comment>
