<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the investigation; interiority is concrete with micro-choices under pressure, though her competence leans slightly stock without deep flaws. The final endurance (Earned Stasis) is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the town's silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with because/therefore linkages; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the cost of failure to foresee is felt. Orientation is clear early, and constraints like the wind patterns shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the container labyrinth constraining choice by amplifying wind patterns; sensory details (e.g., "scent of saltwater and metal") are POV-filtered and charge the final image. Capped due to Q2 <9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding disaster to cultivate foresight) escalates through Elara's agency; one meaningful tightening occurs with the aircraft discovery, and cost is legible in the echoed failure. Coherent under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of foresight vs. fragility emerges through events and images, not statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, e.g., the patch as testament to struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature ("hazy precision"); voice modulates under pressure, and elision (e.g., wind method reveal) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion; no major artifacts or loops. Figurative language ("metallic forest") is purposeful, and rhythm varies naturally with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar elements with specificity (e.g., wind patterns, patch), but isn't highly original; execution is organic and risks are moderate, lacking transformative innovation.</comment>
