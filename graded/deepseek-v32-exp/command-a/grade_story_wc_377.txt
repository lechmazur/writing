<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in preserving wonder, but lacks on-page internal contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under an accumulative/textural lens, with cost felt in the fleeting moment; structure is coherent but simple.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice (e.g., the bluff's height and iceberg fragment charge the final image), with sensory detail woven into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency in creating the kinetic sculpture, with cost legible in the transient symphony, but stakes remain somewhat abstract under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of preserving wonder emerges organically from events and images, with a resonant, non-literal ending that avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature; no head-hopping or dialogue issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with good rhythm and density, but minor overwriting (e.g., "frozen tears of the gods") slightly dulls clarity without major artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of concepts (e.g., seasonally mute bell tuner) feels organic and transformative, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
