<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The coachman's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through concrete perception. His final realization is earned by prior causality, though his agency is somewhat passive, relying on external revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as the coachman's understanding shifts, costing his prior quest; the accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with orientation clear early and the fog lifting symbolizing resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fog-bound river crossing constrains choice and charges the final image, with sensory details like the churning river and ticking gutters woven into action and perception to mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the coachman's ambient awareness under the accumulative lens, culminating in the figure's revelation that narrows options; cost is legible in the foreclosed path of seeking an object.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the palimpsest metaphor, with the ending offering a non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing; subtext in the figure's dialogue enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; lyrical prose and rhythmic control under pressure, such as "percolate through the air," enhance voice without head-hopping or clarity loss.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts; figurative language like "spindrift serenity" is purposeful and clear, supporting momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The palimpsest concept offers a fresh synthesis, transformed through specific details; risk-taking in lyrical accumulation pays off with inevitability, and emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
