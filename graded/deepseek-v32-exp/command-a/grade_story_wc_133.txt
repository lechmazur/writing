<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is concrete with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure; her wry earnestness and insomniac restlessness drive key decisions, and the final renunciation of the brooch for the book earns a decisive change with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (becoming story-keeper) under a causal lens; orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the exchange; the persistent constraint of the island as archive shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details (salt scent, bioluminescent algae) integrated into action; the tidal island as living archive constrains choices and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (search for meaning) escalate through protagonist agency under causal lens; the exchange tightens options with unmistakable cost (brooch for book), foreclosing her prior path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (meaning through stories) emerges from events and images without moralizing; the final reconfiguration offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the book and painting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and controlled, dialogue natural when present; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise is fresh with non-obvious synthesis (post-apocalyptic painter as story-keeper); specific details (amber brooch, rain trails) feel organic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
