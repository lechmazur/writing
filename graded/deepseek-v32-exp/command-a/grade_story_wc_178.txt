<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, with interiority shown through embodied actions like "his eyes scanning," but the "empirically ironic" trait is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The final choice to embrace the unknown is earned through causal progression, with visible cost in his shifted worldview.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in "ready to seal the covenant and become a guardian." Causal lens holds via because/therefore linkages from search to discovery. Orientation is clear early, but the "between regimes" timeframe lacks persistent constraint on tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details like "dimly lit halls" filtering through Kael's POV. The magic square tile as a micro-setting object constrains choice and charges the final image, integral to the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sealing the covenant) is signaled early and escalates through Kael's agency under the causal lens, culminating in a meaningful tightening with cost in his renewed devotion. However, escalation relies on schematic convenience rather than persistent pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of encrypted devotion emerges organically through events and symbols, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the covenant renewal. Subtext operates in imagery like the tile's "shimmering symbols," avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, though prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction (e.g., "dusky harmony"). No dialogue, but narrative stance remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and clarity, with high information density and no major loops or artifacts. Minor register drift in phrases like "empirically ironic" but does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing astronomy and ancient devotion with specific details, but the core premise feels familiar and transformations are competent rather than risk-taking. Emotional truth elevates it, though it lacks indelible freshness.</comment>
