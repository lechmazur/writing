<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her traits as a sculptor, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to embrace her role as keeper is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction is minimal, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Mara realizes her purpose, with felt cost in foreclosing her old path. Causal lens holds strong from motivation to revelation, and orientation is clear early, with no breaks in causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details like salt scent and flickering light integrating into action. The archway and chamber constrain choices and charge the final image, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start, escalating through storm and slide pulses, driven by Mara's agency. Cost is legible in her transformed role, with one meaningful tightening under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of timewoven alliances emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in the slide's patterns. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though it leans slightly explicit at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, reflected in phrases like "turbine-hum reverie." Perception is character-specific, and elision (e.g., GPS failure) is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and vivid, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle in peak beats; sentences advance story momentum seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing driftwood art with magic slides and timewoven alliances. Risks heighten stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable from established particulars.</comment>
