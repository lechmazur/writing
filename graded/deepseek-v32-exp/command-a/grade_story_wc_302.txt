<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions like "cautious exuberance" and micro-choices such as tightening her grip on the watch. The final resolve is earned by prior causality, though some emotion labels verge on abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages (watch guides her, library responds). Closure is a decisive change—her resolve to carry words back—with cost legible in the pulsed parchment and dimmed library glow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices: the shifting symbols force hesitation, and the library's pulsating light charges the final image. Sensory details like the metallic tang are purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens—following the watch's hum to document words—with cost visible in her resolved exuberance and the library's tremor. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken words and cyclical time emerges through particulars like the watch and symbols, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with her role as conduit, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "symbols that shifted as she approached." Voice remains coherent under pressure, and elision (e.g., the cipher's details) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "pulsed with an ethereal light" is consistent and clear, though minor purple hints exist in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mystical library and cyclical time feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the watch's sentience. The concept transforms familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices in character and closure.</comment>
