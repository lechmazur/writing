<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in loss, with embodied emotion in micro-choices like tracing the atlas page. The final renunciation of heartbreak for purpose is earned, though some emotional states are told rather than shown (e.g., "heartbroken" stated early).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara understands sacrifice's light, cost legible in "her heartbreak had not been in vain." Accumulative/textural lens holds via echoes and crystallization, with orientation anchored by ~120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the observatory constraining choice by enabling the crystallization. Sensory details like "cold marble railing" and dome creaking integrate with action, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency in naming the monsters, narrowing options under the accumulative lens. Cost is felt in her transformation, though the internal conflict dominates without external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice and light emerges through particulars like the echoes and naming, with a non-literal answer at the end. No moralizing; subtext operates in imagery and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, perceptual signature in Elara's melancholy. No dialogue; prose reflects her state under pressure with controlled rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "crystallizing into solid, translucent beings" is purposeful and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes reaper lore with emotional depth in a fresh, non-obvious way. Risk-taking in lyrical focus pays off with coherence, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
