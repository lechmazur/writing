<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority showing her fear and cherishing of her telepathy. Her final choice to unseal the embryo is earned by prior causality, and micro-choices under pressure, like pressing the embryo to the kite, reveal her values. However, internal contradictions are more narrated than dramatized in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the embryo unseals, syncing with Mara's heartbeat and vision of rebirth, with felt cost in her resolved stance. The causal drive lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages from decoding to unsealing. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the kite and plants shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the volcanic hot springs charging the final image of rebirth and the plants whispering guidance. However, the environment does not heavily constrain choices beyond atmosphere, and spatial choreography is clear but not pivotal. The micro-setting of the kite and embryo adds specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens, from decoding the script to confronting the guard and unsealing the embryo. The cost is legible in the pulse sync and cracked embryo, forcing a trade-off that forecloses paths. Stakes are tightly braided around tradition evolution and regime opposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images like the embryo and seeds, offering a non-literal answer on rebirth and evolution without moralizing. Subtext in plant whispers and script decoding enriches complexity, but the theme leans slightly toward hopeful resolution, limiting ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a lyrical, perceptual signature reflecting Mara's age and urgency. Voice modulates under pressure, and minimal dialogue feels natural. Elision in decoding is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Figurative language like "steam rose like ghosts" is purposeful, and sentences advance story efficiently. Peak beats remain clear without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of insurgent grandmother, plant telepathy, and amber embryo feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in mystical elements. Specific details like the frayed kite tail avoid tropes, and emotional truth in Mara's role elevates originality.</comment>
