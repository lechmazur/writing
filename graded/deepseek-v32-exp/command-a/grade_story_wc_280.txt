<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as using the tarot coin to guide her actions. The interaction with the other version of herself serves as a crucible, forcing a choice that alters both their states. The final bittersweet endurance is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her ongoing bound state. However, the secondary character is slightly underdeveloped, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Mara's bittersweet smile and the healing timeline, under the accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is anchored early, and causality coheres with Mara's actions driving the change. The persistent constraint of her bound state shapes tactics and the final image, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mystic orchard garden is vividly described with selective sensory details that pressure choices, such as the fractured timeline at the stone fountain constraining Mara's actions. The setting evolves with the plot, mirroring internal states and charging the final image of dawn. It meets the 9+ test by constraining choice and reweighting the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative lens, as she uses the tarot coin to summon and transform the woman, narrowing options and changing knowledge. The cost is legible in the woman's emotional shift and Mara's ongoing purpose. However, the stakes could be more visceral in the middle beat, limiting a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as echoes and the tarot coin, offering a non-literal answer to hope and renewal without moralizing. Subtext operates in the garden's whispers and the final performance metaphor. The ending reweights prior material with resonance, though it leans slightly toward abstraction at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with Mara's synesthetic perception coloring the narrative through rhythmic, poetic prose. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven. The perceptual signature is consistent under pressure, with any elision taught and paid off, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifice obscuring causality. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, enhancing atmosphere without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and the final image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes ghost lore with metaphysical elements in a fresh, inevitable way, transforming tropes through specific character and setting details. Risk-taking in the accumulative style heightens stakes without gimmickry. The synthesis feels organic and charges the closure with emotional truth.</comment>
