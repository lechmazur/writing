<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elena's claustrophobia and motivation are concretely embodied, driving micro-choices under pressure; her final calm is earned through prior causality with visible cost, though some emotional summary slightly dulls peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with coherent closure (Earned Stasis); phase transition is signaled but feels slightly abrupt, though cost is legible in her reconfigured fear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly atmospheric with sensory selectivity; the facility and tidal changes pressure choices and charge the final image, though minor description stalls occur.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal/external conflict) escalates through agency-driven turns; cost is visible in her altered stance, but resolution is somewhat swift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of respecting the invisible emerges through particulars without moralizing; ending offers resonant non-literal answer, though subtext is occasionally explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm controls pressure, and elision in phase transition is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose has strong information density and propulsion; minor overwriting and repetitive stems (e.g., "crashing hush") cause slight drag without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elements with risk-taking in phase transition; specificity in setting and character avoids tropes, though some familiarity lingers.</comment>
