<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is concrete and embodied, with internal conflict shown through her struggle to capture grief in stone. Her final choice to etch the ribbon pattern is earned by prior causality and spectral guidance, with visible cost in her transformed understanding. The "fiercely meditative" trait constrains actions like breath syncing and focused carving.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive lens holds, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration where Elara realizes grief is a migration to be carried. Cost is legible in Tomas's fading presence and her lighter heart. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of grief shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the greenhouse and ribbon constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are filtered through Elara's POV, such as the humming glass and butterfly wings, integrating environment into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes around understanding collective grief escalate under the accumulative lens through reflection and realization. Protagonist agency drives the tightening, as Elara's insight about grief as migration leads to her carving decision, with cost in her transformed perspective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the ribbon and butterflies, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to grief without moralizing. Subtext operates in imagery and silence, and the final image reweights prior material with earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, lyrical rhythm, and controlled diction. Elision is taught and paid off, such as the ribbon's pattern echoing butterfly flight, and no head-hopping or register drift occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "thundering calm," and sentences advance story without obscuring causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravestone carving, spectral mentorship, and family custom feels organic and inevitable, with risk-taking in the quiet, reflective closure. Specific details like the woven ribbon deepen character and stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
