<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in the orchard's sigh and transformed archive, under the accumulative/textural lens.

Cost is legible in the final image, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake in Elara's internal conflict escalates through her agency using induced currents, tightening with the growing hum and leading to a choice that forecloses options with visible cost.
