<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices. Her final decision to stay is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her renunciation of freedom, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as an Earned Stasis with felt cost, under an Accumulative/Textural lens that holds throughout. The orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of her bound destiny shapes tactics and the final image, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details filtered through POV. It constrains choices (e.g., roots forming patterns) and charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ quick test for environmental impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the Accumulative lens, with cost legible in her confrontation with her older self. The dominant stake of purpose vs. debt tightens meaningfully, and the closure forecloses options with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of choice and meaning emerges organically from events and imagery, with subtext in gestures and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Elara's reaffirmed commitment, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The voice is consistent and lyrical, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping, supporting pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats, though minor density in descriptions prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The concept of bartered destinies and inlaying meaning is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure integrates elements organically.</comment>
