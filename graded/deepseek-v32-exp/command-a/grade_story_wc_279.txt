<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final stance crystallization is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her trembling hands and lilac unease. However, "lilac unease" borders on diagnostic label-speak, slightly reducing specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Elara's trembling and reconfigured unease. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, driven by pattern shifts in the mandala. Orientation is clear early, and the tile flake key moment causes decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The whispering grotto and sand mandala constrict choices and charge the final image, with vivid sensory details filtered through Elara's POV. The setting actively pressures tactics, such as the mist lifting in relief at the end, reinforcing the thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Elara's agency, with the mandala shifts and emergent hush deepening stakes. Cost is legible in her unease and trembling, narrowing options meaningfully. One tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to meaning in chaos without moralizing. Subtext operates through whispers and the mandala's dissolution, inviting reflection with purposeful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic and consistent, with Elara's bias shaping narration. Minimal dialogue is natural and advances plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats like the mandala's response. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of familiar themes, with specific details like the chalk artist and tile flake creating inevitability. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure reconfigures meaning.</comment>
