<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses under pressure, reducing depth. Her competence is evident without genuine struggle, though the final choice is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with coherent closure: the library's transformation is a decisive change triggered by Elara's actions, with cost legible in the awakened state. Structure is tight, and orientation is anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, constraining choices (e.g., glass stairs and ledge) and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under causal lens through Elara's agency in ascending and incising, narrowing options with visible cost. Dominant stake (finding stories' beginnings) is signaled early and deepens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of fragmentation and integration emerges organically from events and images, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext operates through implication without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic and consistent, though minor register elevation in peaks doesn't harm clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with good rhythm and density, but slight overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "fractured light") and minor template cadence occur without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes magical realism elements freshly, with specificity in setting and method. Risk-taking in premise heightens stakes, and transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
