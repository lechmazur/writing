<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and rooted in his gift, with micro-choices under pressure like dust analysis and clock repair. His final action earns closure with felt cost, though interiority occasionally leans toward summary in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with cost as ghosts dissipate and building heals, under a causal lens. Orientation is anchored early, and causality links beats tightly, though the whisper "engage" slightly strains motivation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the circus office and mainspring barrel constraining choices and charging the final image. Details like flickering lights and dust patterns are purposefully woven into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Marcus's agency, from finding the barrel to fixing the clock, narrowing options under causal lens. Cost is legible in the warmth and peace, but escalation relies slightly on ghostly guidance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of healing and burden emerges through images and events without moralizing. Ending offers resonant reconfiguration via the ticking clock, though subtext in ghosts' dialogue is somewhat direct.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with perceptual bias in observations. No head-hopping; prose rhythm supports pressure, but minor filter verbs like "felt a pull" slightly dull immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic, with high information density and no major artifacts. Figurative language like "pulse with a life of their own" enhances atmosphere without muddle, though a few phrases are slightly redundant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels organic, with tropes transformed through specific details like the horologist's barrel. Risk-taking in blending genres heightens stakes, but premise echoes familiar ghost-resolution templates.</comment>
