<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The oracle's motivation is clear and consistently drives the narrative, with embodied emotions (e.g., trembling fingers) and micro-choices under pressure. The final endurance feels earned, though contradictory impulses are subtle rather than pronounced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise with cost (the last star vanishing), under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the dimming star shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory details (e.g., "storm-tossed ridge fort," "ambered hush") constrict choice and charge the final image. The fort and booklet function as micro-settings that actively pressure the oracle's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the oracle's agency in retelling stories, deepening the silence and dimming the star under the Accumulative lens. The cost is legible as the night intensifies, though the stakes remain internal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the concrete action of summarizing silence, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the map's shaping. Subtext operates in gestures and implications without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature focused on silence and darkness. The voice remains consistent under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., summarizing silence) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats like the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes familiar tropes (oracle, map-making) with a fresh focus on silence and darkness, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
