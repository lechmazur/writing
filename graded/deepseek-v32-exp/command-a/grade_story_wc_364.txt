<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eli's characterization is consistent with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure; his decision to barter his awakening is earned with visible cost, though his meekness could be more dynamically tested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly with clear orientation; closure lands on-page with felt cost in Eli's changed state, and the abandoned mines shape tactics persistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with floating rock arches and mines constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details are selectively integrated through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Eli's agency under the causal lens, from barter to journey, with cost legible in his personal transformation; stakes are clear and tighten meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resilience and sacrifice emerges organically from events; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is controlled and rhythmic under pressure, and dialogue (though brief) is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or artifacts; figurative language is consistent and supports momentum, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh specificity; risk-taking in setting and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
