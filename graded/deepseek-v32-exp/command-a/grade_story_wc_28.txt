<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to rearrange the mosaic as an earned choice with visible cost. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion in tracing the tessera. However, the "heart both warm and cold" feels slightly abstract, limiting peak score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the plaza becomes a beacon of hope, with cost legible in Elara's resolve. The accumulative/textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early, but lacks a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting constrains choice and charges the final image, with the mosaic guiding Elara's actions. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, such as the "faint, acrid tang" and "shattered sky," integrated into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency in rearranging the mosaic, deepening the stake of renaming mercy under the accumulative lens. Cost is visible in her tireless work and the plaza's transformation, but intensity is moderate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of aberrant mercy emerges through events and images, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer. The mosaic's reconfiguration reweights prior material without moralizing, though some abstraction remains.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic diction and rhythmic control. No head-hopping, but minor register drift in phrases like "gentle radical" slightly limits peak score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and purposeful imagery. No major artifacts or loops, though slight overwriting in descriptors like "heart both warm and cold" occurs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The concept of renaming reality through a mosaic is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in symbolic structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming familiar tropes.</comment>
