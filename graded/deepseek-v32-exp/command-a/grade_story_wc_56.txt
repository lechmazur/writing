<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her actions; micro-choices under pressure, like salvaging the chest, reveal her values. However, interiority lacks contradictory impulses in scene, preventing higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as Elara gains clarity; causal lens holds with clear orientation early; cost is legible in the weight of the journal's words and sundial's glow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (canal guides salvage) and charges the final image; sensory details (damp earth, machinery hum) are selective and POV-filtered, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency in salvaging the journal; cost is felt in her heartache and the sundial's message, tightening options under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus lies emerges through particulars like the journal confession; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though some echoes feel slightly explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, though no dialogue is present to test character distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control; no loops or artifacts obscure clarity; figurative language ("surface a mirror") serves momentum without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept of sundial as truth-key offers fresh synthesis; tropes are transformed through specific details, but risk-taking is moderate, lacking groundbreaking innovation.</comment>
