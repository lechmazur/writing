<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as her heart quickening and steady hand jotting notes. Her final act of whispering names and placing the globe back is earned by prior causality, showing a credible endurance with felt cost. However, internal conflict is subtle rather than deeply contradictory, limiting the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong, with dreams building patternically toward a Resonant Reconfiguration closure as the snow globe clears and Elara whispers names, costing emotional connection. Orientation is anchored early in the Arctic and shrine, and the drive lens coheres without ambiguity. Cost is legible in the final image of the globe glowing, though the closure leans slightly quiet for top tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Arctic setting and candle-lit shrine are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail, and the snow globe as a micro-setting object charges the final image by clearing to reveal the village. Environment constrains choice by serving as Elara's sanctuary and tool for connection. Specificity is high, with ice walls humming and starlight borrowing, but lacks a constraining physical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering truth escalates accumulatively through dream revelations driven by Elara's agency, narrowing options as she pieces together the story. Cost is felt in her emotional tremor and the dawn's symbolic warmth. One meaningful tightening occurs as visions compound, but the escalation is more thematic than causal, under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory and connection emerges organically through the snow globe's transformation and dream fragments, with subtext in the melted globe symbolizing distorted beauty. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer as the globe clears, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete, though ambiguity is limited.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, reflected in rhythmic prose and perceptual signature like "hushed stillness" and "borrowed starlight." No head-hopping; elision in dream sequences is taught and pays off. Dialogue is absent, so focus is on narrative control, which remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied sentence rhythms, advancing story without scaffolds or loops. Figurative language like "dancing shadows" is purposeful and coherent. Information density is high, with lines doing multiple jobs, and no artifacts obscure closure. Minor overwriting in peak beats doesn't harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concept of a wreck-diver ghost whisperer using dreams is a fresh synthesis, transforming tropes through specific details like the melted snow globe and dream analysis. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, and risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Inevitability in hindsight is strong, but not fully rare.</comment>
