<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but internal conflict is minimal; emotions are told rather than embodied under pressure. The final choice to meet Clara is earned, but the cost is light, lacking deep contradiction or struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the locket feels lighter, signaling purpose fulfilled with felt cost. Causal lens holds tightly from envelope to friendship, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Settings like the symphony hall and library are vividly described but serve as backdrops rather than constraining choices or charging the final image. Sensory details are selective but not deeply integrated into tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (connection and uplift) escalates through Elara's agency in writing and meeting Clara, under causal lens. Cost is legible but mild, focusing on emotional risk without significant trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of compassion cycles emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in the locket's reweighting. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, enriching prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is consistent and lyrical, though dialogue is minimal. No head-hopping, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with good rhythm and density, but minor overwriting (e.g., "whimsically attentive") slightly muddles peak beats. No major loops or artifacts; propulsion remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Premise of mistaken envelope leading to friendship is executed well but not highly original; synthesis feels organic yet familiar. Risk-taking is minimal, though emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
