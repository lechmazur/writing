<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied interiority like "her heart ached faintly, an affectionate detachment" showing contradictory impulses under pressure. Her final choice to subsume the petal's essence is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost in her reflection on half-truths.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Elara's acknowledgment of transient joy, under a causal lens that holds throughout. The half-truth concept acts as a persistent constraint, shaping tactics and the final image without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory with POV-filtered details like "amber grotto at dusk" and "scent of damp earth," but it does not strongly constrain choices or charge the final image beyond atmosphere, capping the score below the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens, with one meaningful tightening as she subsumes the petal, narrowing options and legible cost in her heartache and the understanding of joy's transience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of half-truths and transient emotions emerges organically from events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through Elara's reflection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control, such as the poetic prose in "the amber light warmer," and no head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold, with figurative language like "light filtered through ancient stalactites like molten gold" serving purpose and not muddying peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of the emotion-dealer premise with specific, grounded choices in character and theme, feeling inevitable in hindsight and heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
