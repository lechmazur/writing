<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and drives choices, with embodied emotion at closure (tears). The "analytically intuitive" trait is shown through puzzle-solving, but "volcanic tenderness" is somewhat told rather than fully dramatized, limiting interior contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost (tears on translating the scroll) under a causal lens, with logical linkage from clues to resolution. Orientation is clear early, and the archive constrains tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory (shadows, stone floors, ethereal glow), actively constraining choices as the arsonist navigates. The archive charges the final image and shapes the trail's mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (rescuing the promise), escalation is driven by protagonist agency in following clues, and cost is legible at closure with emotional weight. One meaningful tightening suffices under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of love and sacrifice emerges through particulars like the tapestry and scroll, with a resonant, non-literal ending. Avoids moralizing, but slight sentimentality in the closure slightly limits complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (analytical, reverent). Voice remains consistent under pressure, though phrases like "volcanic tenderness" edge toward ornamentation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has varied rhythm and clarity, with good propulsion. Minor figurative strain in "volcanic tenderness" and some ornate phrasing, but no loops or scaffolds that harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise of an arsonist rescuing a promise is fresh and specific, transforming tropes through grounded details. Synthesis feels inevitable, with risk in tone balancing fierceness and tenderness.</comment>
