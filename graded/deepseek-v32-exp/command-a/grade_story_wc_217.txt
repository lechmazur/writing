<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Characterization is strong with clear motivation and embodied emotion; the poet's warmth and attentiveness drive key choices. However, lacking strong contradictory impulses in scene prevents the highest band, though the final shared action is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the kite release reweights beauty in the incomplete, with cost felt in the shared moment. Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory detail (cobalt lagoon, wet earth scent) and constrains choice—the kite's landing and lagoon environment charge the final image. Micro-setting elements like the feather and kite are integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (beauty in the incomplete) escalate through agency under the Accumulative lens, with the kite repair and release serving as a meaningful tightening. Cost is legible in the shared realization and foreclosed paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in dialogue and actions; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The conceptual repricing of beauty through the kite poem is earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control; dialogue is natural and goal-driven. Perceptual signature is strong, and elision (e.g., kite's poetry) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise and lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere seamlessly, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines through specific synthesis (poet-wanderer dynamic, kite with poetry) that feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet reflection heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Tropes are transformed with emotional truth.</comment>
