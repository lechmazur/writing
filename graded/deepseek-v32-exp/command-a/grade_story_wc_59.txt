<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal his values. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, though minor telling of emotions (e.g., "spark of determination") slightly reduces concrete interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual repricing as Kael realizes beauty cannot be forced, reweighting the premise with felt cost. Causal lens holds tightly from motivation to discovery, and orientation is anchored early in the cavernous realm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices, such as the hidden passage and cavern constraining Kael's path. The egg and machine as micro-settings charge the final image with eerie light, influencing tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the causal lens, from library research to assembling the machine, with cost legible in the realization that progress over preservation was a choice. Stakes tighten meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through Kael's journey, offering a resonant, non-literal answer about nurturing beauty without moralizing. The ending image of the egg's glow reweights prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, and prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity. No head-hopping, though minor register consistency in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, but slight overwriting in phrases like "quaking reverie" introduces minor figurative strain. No loops or artifacts harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes mechanical decay and natural beauty with originality, transforming tropes through specific character choices. Risk-taking in the conceptual repricing heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
