<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and earned change through the letter. However, internal conflict could be more dynamically contradictory in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with felt cost under causal lens; orientation is early and clear. The letter slightly conveniences resolution but remains earned through prior causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the pillbox and hollowed tree constraining choice and charging the final image. Mist and bluff atmosphere support but do not fully pressure tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are dominant and internal; escalation via code-following narrows options under causal lens with cost legible. Agency drives progression, though conflict remains introspective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through symbols and journey, with resonant non-literal closure. Minor explicit phrasing in "fixing what's broken" slightly reduces subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively lyrical, with perceptual signature clear. No dialogue, but elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with no major artifacts; figurative language is consistent but occasionally purple without harming clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of redemption trope with specific details like snow codes; feels inevitable but not highly innovative. Execution is strong without gimmickry.</comment>
