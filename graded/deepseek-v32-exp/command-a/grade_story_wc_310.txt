<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion (e.g., hands trembling), but interiority lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and the final determination feels earned yet somewhat linear without deep internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the weight of cosmic responsibility; Hybrid lens (causal and accumulative) holds strong, but cost is more conceptual than viscerally sharp.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice—the ambered observatory and distillation apparatus pressure Lira's actions—and sensory details (e.g., static bursts, glinting coins) charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation under Hybrid lens is driven by Lira's agency in distilling essence and using coins, narrowing options from doubt to certainty; cost is legible but somewhat abstract in the cosmic stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of rebirth and meaning emerges organically from events and images (coins, static), with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic perceptual signature; purposeful compression and rhythmic control under pressure, and no head-hopping or voice leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density and clear propulsion; minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "deafening and silent static burst") but no loops or artifacts that obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of cosmic contraction and prophecy, transformed through specific details (e.g., distillation of static); risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
