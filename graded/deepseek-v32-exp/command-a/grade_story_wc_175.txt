<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to honor overlooked histories is clear and drives her actions, with embodied emotion in pauses and sensing. However, internal conflict is subtle, and the final choice, while earned, lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with cost legible in "the weight of the monarchs’ absence," under an accumulative/textural lens that holds. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of absence shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the grotto and objects like the moth wing charging the final image. The environment influences Elara's actions, though spatial choreography is minimal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes around honoring histories escalate through the monarchs' scarcity, driven by Elara's agency in building structures. Cost is felt in the absence, but escalation is gradual under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of transformation and memory emerges through images like the moth wing, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext in actions avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and perceptual signature. Rhythmic control under pressure, such as in the humming beat, and no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high density and varied rhythm, advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffolds; figurative language is purposeful, though slightly purple in peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the synthesis of esoteric realism with environmental loss, offering a fresh angle. However, it lacks bold risk-taking and feels somewhat familiar in its quiet narrative.</comment>
