<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to cultivate sparks is clear and drives key choices, but internal conflict is underdeveloped; her final decision to protect divergence feels earned but lacks deep contradictory impulses or visible cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the archive diverges, under a Causal lens; orientation is clear early, and the clock's role provides persistent constraint, though cost is more conceptual than felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The glowing dune and archive are vividly specific and constrain choices (e.g., sand guiding path, jars reigniting), charging the final image with purposeful sensory detail integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Causal lens, using the charm and clock to revive the archive, with a conceptual cost in the diverging sparks; one meaningful tightening occurs, but stakes lack visceral intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of hope and divergence emerges organically through images like the clock and sparks, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext in the charm's power enriches depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "fractured lullaby" carried on the wind); voice remains coherent under pressure, and elision is purposeful, though dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and information density, with no major artifacts; minor overwriting in phrases like "fractured lullaby" does not harm clarity or closure, and propulsion is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes post-apocalyptic and magical elements with specificity; the clock and archive transformation feel inevitable, and risk-taking in the divergent ending heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
