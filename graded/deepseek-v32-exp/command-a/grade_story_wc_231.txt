<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to carry the stranger's memories is earned with visible cost, though interior contradictions are subtle rather than pronounced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The plot coheres with clear causality, and orientation is anchored early, though the drive lens is slightly ambiguous before midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The opal dock and mist function as micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, integrated into action and perception with no generic placeholder elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the Accumulative lens, with a meaningful tightening through the journal discovery. Cost is legible on the page, though the stake deepens rather than forecloses options dramatically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory and isolation emerges organically from particulars, with subtext in gesture and image. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, and the Edelweiss reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature. Rhythm controls pressure well, and any elision is taught and paid off, though dialogue is absent and not evaluated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, and peak beats avoid muddle, though minor register consistency could be sharper.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of borrowed memories is a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in quiet resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry, but it lacks bold structural innovation.</comment>
