<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost when she leaves the logbook. However, contradictory impulses are not fully dramatized in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost when Elara leaves the logbook, reconfiguring the meaning of thresholds. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with the terrace and memory shift tightening stakes. Orientation is clear early, and no causality breaks occur.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is vividly described with sensory detail and constrains choices by shifting and pulling Elara into memories. It charges the final image and is integral to the narrative arc, with no generic or static elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens, as her intuition and the terrace's shift deepen stakes. The cost is legible when she forecloses her quest by leaving the logbook, though the escalation lacks multiple distinct beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, with the ending offering a non-literal answer to the central question of thresholds. Subtext in the logbook codes and father's words avoids moralizing, creating resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical prose and rhythmic control. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is taught and paid off in closure, though dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, with clear propulsion in peak beats. Minor overwriting in descriptive passages prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements (prism terrace, logbook, thresholds) feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightening stakes. Emotional specificity and transformation of tropes avoid derivativeness.</comment>
