<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to cultivate lightness in grief is clear and rooted in consistent traits; her internal conflict is embodied through actions like whittling, and her final resolve is earned with visible cost in the emotional void and brother's loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elara's resolve hardens; the Accumulative lens holds throughout, with cost legible in the whittled heart and the mandate's oppression shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (farmhouse, turbines) and objects (bouquet, whittled heart) constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV to mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency in whittling and reflecting; cost is unmistakable in her brother's loss and emotional void, under the Accumulative lens, with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of finding lightness in grief emerges through particulars without moralizing; subtext in actions and images offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; internal monologue and prose rhythm control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propelled with high information density; no loops or scaffold, and figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with clear syntax under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Familiar dystopian premise is transformed through specific details like whittling and dried flowers; synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking in quiet resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
