<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and earned resolution; however, her perfection limits internal contradiction, and the "tranquilly perceptive" trait feels slightly tell-not-show in peaks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change and cost under causal lens; orientation is early and clear; stamp as persistent constraint shapes tactics, and causality holds without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details integrate with action; library and stamp constrain choices and charge the final image, with setting actively guiding discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency under causal lens; cost is legible in her deepened resolve and time pressure, though escalation lacks multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of truth emerges organically from events without moralizing; final image reweights prior material with resonance, but slight explicitness in "power of honesty" limits ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable POV with distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm supports pressure without head-hopping, though no dialogue tests naturalism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive with high information density; no major artifacts, but minor overwriting like "tranquilly perceptive" slightly dulls peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis feels inevitable with fresh take on tropes; specific details elevate concept, though not radically innovative.</comment>
