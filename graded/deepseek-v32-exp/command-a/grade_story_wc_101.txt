<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving key choices from anonymous donations to public declaration, though internal contradiction is minimal. Her final stance is earned with visible cost in community unity and personal peace.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under a causal lens, cost felt in Mara's peace and community's shift from survival to unity. Orientation is clear early, and lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the terra-cotta arbor and bell charging key moments, but the arbor doesn't strongly constrain choices; the bell, however, reweights the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate meaningfully through Mara's agency, from midnight runs to gathering declaration, with cost legible in community response and enduring sanctions. Escalation tightens options under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hope and intergenerational support emerges organically from events and symbols like the bell, with subtext in actions; ending offers resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct lyrical voice, perceptual signature in Mara's perspective, and dialogue is natural and goal-driven; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean and propelled, with varied rhythm and high information density; no loops, artifacts, or figurative muddle in peak beats like the gathering scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Execution is fresh with specific details and emotional truth, though premise of community resilience is familiar; synthesis feels inevitable but not highly original.</comment>
