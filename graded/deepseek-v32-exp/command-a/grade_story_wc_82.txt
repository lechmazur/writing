<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's grief is embodied through specific actions like gem polishing and origami folding, with internal conflict dramatized in scene. His final choice to honor grief rather than escape it is earned by prior causality, though the epiphany moment feels slightly swift. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, and the cost of letting go is visible on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Kael shifts from controlling to releasing grief, felt cost in the unfolding crane and softened light. Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages from Lira's advice to basilica realization. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure tightens meaningfully around the protagonist's agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image: the floating island's paradoxical motion mirrors Kael's despair, and the glass basilica's light shifts during his epiphany. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven through action. The origami crane as a micro-setting object reweights meaning at closure, making it indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict with grief) escalates through protagonist agency under the causal lens, from Lira's challenge to the basilica realization. Cost is legible in Kael's trembling hands and the shift within him. One meaningful tightening forecloses his escape route and forces a trade-off, though the escalation is somewhat linear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of grief and transformation emerges through particulars like dreamstones and origami, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures (unfolding the crane) and imagery, though the "luminous torment" phrase edges toward label-speak.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in Lira's advice. Prose rhythm varies purposefully, and psychic distance shifts intentionally during the climax. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and information density, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting in phrases like "luminous torment" and a slight template cadence in descriptive sequences, but no artifacts that obscure causality or closure. Concise and vivid overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of dream recording and grief processing feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific character choices. The floating island and glass basilica offer a fresh angle. Risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure reconfigures prior material.</comment>
