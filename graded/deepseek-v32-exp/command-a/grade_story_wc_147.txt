<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maya's motivation shifts credibly from survival to discovery, driven by embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation of fear for wonder is earned by prior causality, though some emotional beats rely on told summary rather than fully dramatized contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Maya transcends survival to embrace discovery, cost legible in her transformed perspective. Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages, and the persistent constraint of dwindling oxygen shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The underwater temple is vividly specific and constrains choices, charging the final image with its shifting walls and crystal chamber. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Maya's urgency and professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maya's agency under the causal lens, as oxygen depletion and vial-guided unsnarling force a trade-off from flight to engagement. Cost is unmistakable in her altered motivation and the temple's transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the vial and crystals, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on harnessing ephemeral beauty. Subtext operates through imagery and memory without moralizing, deepening the closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm and diction reflect Maya's scientific mindset and rising wonder. No head-hopping, and purposeful elision (e.g., the distress signal fading) pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied syntax, though minor purple phrasing ("ethereal glow," "lonesome splendor") slightly dulls peak beats. No loops or scaffold artifacts; clarity and momentum remain high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of underwater exploration, memory-touch mechanics, and thematic depth feels fresh and inevitable. Specific details transform tropes, though risk-taking is moderate, leaning on familiar archetypes for structure.</comment>
