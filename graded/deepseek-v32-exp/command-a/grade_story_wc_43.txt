<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving key choices like contacting Claire, with embodied emotion in moments like handling the vinyl fragment. However, her decisiveness and kindness are sometimes told rather than shown, and lack contradictory impulses under pressure, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as the reunion brings warmth and reconciliation, with felt cost in the emotional weight and time constraints. The causal lens holds strong, with Elara's actions directly leading to the payoff, and the broken vinyl symbolically charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like the "scent of hope" and the radiant haven, creating a serene atmosphere. However, while the broken vinyl adds thematic depth, it does not constrain choices or actively pressure tactics, capping the score below the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear with Mrs. Bennett's need for reconciliation, and escalation is driven by Elara's agency in contacting Claire, narrowing options and leading to a cost-legible closure. The tension and resolution feel earned under the causal lens, though the escalation is somewhat linear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of healing and beauty in brokenness emerges organically through the vinyl motif and reunion, with subtext in gestures like Mrs. Bennett's whisper. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and limited to Elara, with a distinct, poetic voice that reflects her serenity and purpose. Rhythmic control is strong, and elision (e.g., the brief call to Claire) is taught and paid off without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and dense, with sentences advancing character and theme simultaneously, as in the description of the vinyl fragment. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; rhythm and syntax vary purposefully to support momentum and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise of a hospice therapist executing goodbyes is grounded in specific details like the broken vinyl, offering a fresh angle on familiar themes of reconciliation. However, it lacks high risk-taking or non-obvious synthesis, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
