<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her ascent with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final realization is earned by prior causality, though interior contradiction is minimal. The cost of her emotional shift is felt on-page, satisfying the quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual repricing as Elara deciphers the diary, reconfiguring her understanding of joy with visible cost in her tears. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with each floor adding density. Orientation is clear early, and the elevator timeframe tightens decisions coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The icebound spire setting pressures choices through cold and thin air, while recurring objects like the goggles and diary constrain actions and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's POV, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate accumulatively through Elara's agency in discovering diary pages and decoding symbols, narrowing her understanding toward the climax. Cost is legible in her emotional transformation, and the dominant stake of seeking joy is consistently tested under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Elara's journey, with the mentor's words and her realization offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through light and object motifs, and the ending reweights prior material with earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature through Elara's observations and inquiries. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., diary decryption) pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits varied rhythm and high information density without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "scattered light" is purposeful and clear, and sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative build. No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar elements (ice spire, encrypted diary) into a fresh, inevitable arc through specific details and emotional truth. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though it stops short of rare innovation.</comment>
