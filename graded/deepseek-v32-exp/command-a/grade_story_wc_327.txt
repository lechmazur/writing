<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot with embodied emotion, but internal conflict is minimal, lacking contradictory impulses in scene; the final transformation is earned but feels slightly neat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with legible cost as the diamond shatters and Lira collapses, under a causal lens that holds tightly; orientation is clear early, and the flawed diamond acts as a persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting of bone towers and echo canyon is vividly specific and integrates into action, constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of saving the language is signaled early; escalation is driven by Lira's agency in harnessing echoes, with visible cost in her weakening, under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of language preservation emerges organically from events, with subtext in echoes and diamond; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is consistent and purposefully descriptive, though dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose has good rhythm and density, but minor clichés like "jagged teeth" and "luminescent moss" reduce freshness; no major artifacts or loops harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Concepts like translating texture into sound are fresh and well-integrated, but execution leans on familiar fantasy tropes without full transformation; specificity anchors originality.</comment>
