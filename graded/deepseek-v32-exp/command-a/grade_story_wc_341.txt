<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her trait of seeing the sky's soul; her leap is earned by prior causality with visible cost, though interior contradiction is minimal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost in the leap and lingering light; accumulative/textural lens holds strong with clear orientation early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (gondola strands her) and charges the final image; sensory details like "dusty starlight" are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under accumulative lens, from observation to leap, with cost legible in the risk taken; stakes are internal but coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, with a non-literal answer at the end; slight explicitness in "Empty spaces do remember" prevents higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in cloud categorization; lyrical prose maintains coherence under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold, and figurative language like "whispers in a dream" is purposeful and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sky as memory archive feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical approach heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
