<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and personal, driving the narrative with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final realization is earned through prior causality, but contradictory impulses are not strongly enacted in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost on the page ("Lira smiled softly..."). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with patterns coalescing into insight, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The iridescent cave and crater glass constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory detail filtered through Lira's POV. The setting actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens occurs through density increase in Lira's conjectures, leading to a deepening that reweights stakes with visible cost. Agency drives the turn, but the internal conflict limits peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and rediscovery emerges organically, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through images like the path and seeds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively lyrical, with perceptual signature in Lira's noticing. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off, though minor convergence in peak beats occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no major artifacts or loops. Figurative language is purposeful, though slight overwriting in descriptive passages prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Concept of a recollectionist and memory work feels fresh and organic, with synthesis inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
