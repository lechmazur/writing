<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; her purposefully curious nature and dedication to her mentor drive her choices under pressure. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like "heart quickened" and micro-choices such as ignoring the communicator. The final endurance to outlast the dawn is earned by the message discovery and prior causality, with visible cost in the dawnlit melancholy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), with Elara's endurance foreclosing early departure and costing her melancholy, felt in the final image. The causal lens holds tightly from message discovery to documentation, and the dawn constraint shapes tactics. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible in "a bittersweet reminder of the impermanence of all things."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "crunching softly against the lunar regolith" filtering through Elara's POV. The moonlit summit pressures choices by imposing a time constraint (dawn) that alters tactics. The lunar module and sand grain recur to charge the final image, though the module's role is more atmospheric than constraining.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preservation vs. progress) escalates under the causal lens via Elara's agency: discovering the message narrows options, and dawn's approach deepens urgency. Cost is legible in her "heavy heart" and the loss felt at closure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the message compels her to stay, foreclosing easy return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence and legacy emerges organically from events like the timed message and sand grain, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the site "bathed in the golden light," reweighting prior material with conceptual cost. Subtext operates in the mentor's plea and Elara's silent actions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in Elara's poetic yet professional voice. Diction and syntax reflect her urgency and melancholy, e.g., "the dawning hush would remain." No head-hopping; minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven. Elision in reflection is anchored to present stimuli.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "shadows danced with the silvery glow" is purposeful and coherent. No scaffold or register drift; closure image is clear and uncompromised by line-level issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of lunar preservation and legacy, transformed through specific details like the chemical message and sand grain. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, and risk-taking in the quiet, melancholy ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The closure feels inevitable from established pattern.</comment>
