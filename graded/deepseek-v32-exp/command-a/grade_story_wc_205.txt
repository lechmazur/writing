<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices. However, some emotional beats, like "burnished sorrow," are told rather than fully dramatized in scene, slightly reducing immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elara's triumph is bittersweet, wounds unhealed; cost is legible in the final image. Causal drive lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages, and the shard acts as a persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the baroque asteroid and crystal shard constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redemption) escalates through Elara's agency under the causal lens, culminating in her hall intrusion and shard use; cost is felt in her unhealed wounds. One meaningful tightening forecloses options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reimagining emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in the shard's symbolism; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, as broken things "hold light."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic perceptual signature; voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., plan devising) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, but minor overwriting (e.g., "burnished sorrow") and elevated diction in peak beats slightly reduce clarity; no major artifacts or loops harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Concept of temporal plasticity and baroque asteroid offers a fresh synthesis, transformed through specific character choices and world logic; risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
