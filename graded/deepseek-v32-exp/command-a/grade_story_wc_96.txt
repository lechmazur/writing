<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's molting personalities and motivation to forge beauty from anarchy are well-dramatized through concrete interiority and micro-choices, though the trait lacks deep internal contradiction in scene. Clara's quiet strength adds relational pressure, and their friendship forces choices that alter the library's state. The final permanence feels earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elias feels permanence and the library becomes a beacon, with felt cost under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, though the molting trait could tighter shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The rusted library constrains choices and charges the final image as a sanctuary, with selective sensory details (e.g., "air smelled of dust and time") woven through action. Environment pressures decisions and mirrors internal states, avoiding cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes of rebuilding and finding light escalate through protagonist agency, with one meaningful tightening as Elias feels permanence and the library glows with vitality. Cost is legible in the transformation, though no major reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of blooming resistance emerges from events and images without moralizing, offering a resonant non-literal answer through the library's symbolism and Elias's poems. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; prose has rhythmic control and purposeful compression, e.g., "His coat was patched with stories." Dialogue natural and goal-driven when present, but minimal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with varied syntax and good read-aloud rhythm; minor figurative density (e.g., "luminous fracture") but no artifacts harming closure. Information density high, with sentences advancing multiple elements.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of vagrant poet, molting personalities, and library rebuilding feels organic and inevitable, with risk-taking in concept that heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details avoid template plots.</comment>
