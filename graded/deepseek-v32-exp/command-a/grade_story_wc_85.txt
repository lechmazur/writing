<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's guilt is concretely embodied through actions like clenching the watch hand, and his final renunciation of lying is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Interior contradiction is shown in his struggle between professional duty and morality, with no stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a decisive change with felt cost ("the weight of the withheld truth crashed over him"), under a causal lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the watch hand persistently constrains tactics, shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and driftwood carvings constrain choice and charge the closure, with vivid sensory details like "scent of salt and decay" filtered through POV. The environment actively guides Elias's realization, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the causal lens, from unease to realization through sifting driftwood, with cost legible in his physical reaction. The dominant stake (internal guilt vs. redemption) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of guilt and truth emerges through images like the fractured mirror and driftwood, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer ("fractured pieces of his own soul"). No moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, e.g., "the sieved hush followed him." No head-hopping or register drift, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is cohesive, and syntax varies purposefully, e.g., the hypnotic sea rhythm mirrors internal state.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise of a black market genealogist is fresh and synthesized with specific details like the watch hand. Risk-taking in the quiet ending heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
