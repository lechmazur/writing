<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's claustrophobia and adventurous spirit create tangible internal conflict, embodied in her physical struggle through narrow passages. Her motivation is rooted in personal history (father's legacy) and intensifies under pressure, compelling her final choice to embrace mutiny. The transformation of fear into strength is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the climax. However, minor diagnostic language ("prudently adventurous") slightly reduces specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds consistently, with clear linkage from inciting incident to closure. Orientation is anchored early, and the decisive change—Elara's liberation from fear—lands on-page with felt cost in the chamber's transformation. The compass and spatial mutiny concept provide persistent constraints that shape tactics. No causality breaks or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory details (scent of stone, otherworldly glow) that reflect POV bias and urgency. The narrow alleys and chamber directly constrain choices, testing claustrophobia, and the compass charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent, though some symbols shift vaguely, slightly reducing precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering the key and overcoming fear) escalates through Elara's agency under causal lens, as her choices in the labyrinth force a trade-off between claustrophobia and determination. Cost is legible when she battles confinement and emerges transformed. One meaningful tightening occurs at the archway passage, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of liberation from internal and external constraints emerges organically through images like the compass and organ melody, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Elara's wistful rebellion and the path forward. Subtext in the organ's code enriches meaning, but some thematic echoes ("spatial mutiny") lean slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending poetic diction with Elara's urgency. Voice modulates under stress (e.g., compressed syntax in climax), and elision (e.g., spatial mutiny mechanics) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping, though minor register drift in peak beats ("reverberation echoing") slightly reduces consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose exhibits strong rhythm and varied sentence structures, with high information density advancing plot and atmosphere. No significant loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle; metaphors (e.g., "danced like specters") serve purpose. Minor overwriting in dense descriptions ("shadowed nexus under starlight") but clarity and propulsion remain intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Originality arises from specific synthesis of explorer trope with spatial mutiny and personal legacy, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in metaphysical concepts heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, though core premise echoes familiar relic-hunting arcs without full transformation.</comment>
