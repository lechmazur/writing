<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through concrete actions like handling the ribbon. However, some emotions are stated rather than fully embodied, such as "her own heart carried its own cracks," which slightly reduces immediacy. The final choice to persist and transform the vow is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the ribbon's integration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Elara's emotional journey and the ribbon's symbolic transformation. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through imagery and realization. Orientation is clear early, and the lens coherence supports the ending's impact without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting—cathedral orchard—constrains choices and charges the final image, as seen when the orchard responds to Elara's actions. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV, with the environment actively shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are internal and clear, with escalation driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens, such as using forgotten bag contents to unlock revelations. Cost is legible in her emotional shift and the vow's transformation, though the escalation is more gradual than tight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of renewal and generational wisdom emerges through particulars like the ribbon and vows, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the glowing tree image, reweighting prior material with emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic yet controlled prose. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and any elision (e.g., the breach backstory) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no major artifacts like loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, though minor purple tones in peaks (e.g., "quartz in her eyes glimmered") don't obscure clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements—quartz-eye mender, deciduous vows—feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the lyrical structure. Specificity in character and setting avoids template plots, and emotional truth elevates originality.</comment>
