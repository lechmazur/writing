<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her kinship with the ghost, driving her to encode its essence. Her micro-choices under pressure, such as using the bolt plate during the storm, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. However, her emotional progression lacks contradictory impulses in scene, leaning slightly toward tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the ghost's release and dissolution, a resonant reconfiguration under the causal lens, cost legible in Elara's solitude. The timeframe between lightning and thunder acts as a persistent constraint, shaping tactics. Orientation is clear early, and causality holds without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the misty courtyard and storm atmosphere filtering through Elara's perception. The flower press bolt plate constrains choice and charges the final image, serving as a key object that alters tactics and outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of freeing the ghost escalates under causal lens through Elara's agency, tightened by the timeframe. Cost is felt in the ghost's dissolution and Elara's renewed purpose. One meaningful deepening occurs as encoding progresses, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of giving voice to the voiceless emerges organically from events and images, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the ghost's release and Elara's continued work, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, poetic rhythm, and controlled diction. Elision is purposeful, such as the graffiti art's role, taught early and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and enhances clarity, even in peak beats like the encoding sequence. Sentence-level propulsion supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of digital and mystical elements feels inevitable, with the ghost in code concept transforming tropes through specific choices. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure is fully integrated.</comment>
