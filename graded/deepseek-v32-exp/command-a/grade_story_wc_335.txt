<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to mentor resilience is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion shown through trembling fingers and backward walking. Her internal conflict is dramatized in her struggle with the shard-mirror, and the final choice to complete the annotation feels earned by prior causality. However, some peak moments rely slightly on descriptive summary rather than deep interiority, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative/textural lens, closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the shard-mirror transforms from prison to portal, with felt cost in Elara's quiet resolve. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity. The ending image reweights prior material with undeniable pressure, satisfying the cost proof test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The forgotten library constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like dust motes and aged paper woven into action. Setting actively pressures Elara's task, and the shard-mirror as a micro-setting evolves meaningfully. Specificity is high, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Elara's agency in annotating the shadow, with a meaningful tightening as her words cause the shadow to shimmer. Cost is legible in her transformed resolve and the library's expectant silence. However, the stakes could be more visceral in middle beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of resilience and reversible exile emerges organically through images and actions, with subtext in gestures like the tea leaves shaping the story. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the portal image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic prose reflects Elara's mindset, and rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under stress, with purposeful elision in the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm, though minor overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "steam curling like whispers") slightly dulls peak beats. No major loops or scaffolds; closure image remains clear and propelled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes elements with originality, transforming tropes through specific details like tea leaf geometry. The combination feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
