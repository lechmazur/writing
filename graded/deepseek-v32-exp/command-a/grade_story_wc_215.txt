<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and his motivation intensifies believably, but lacks strong contradictory impulses in scene; final choice is earned with visible cost, though emotional depth is somewhat straightforward.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with felt cost under a causal lens; orientation is immediate and persistent constraints (covenant, box) shape tactics; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the oasis and box constraining choices and charging the final image; details are purposefully integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elias's agency under causal lens, culminating in a ritual with legible cost; one meaningful tightening forecloses options effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken words emerges organically through events and images; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, transforming tropes through grounded details; synthesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the quiet, resonant ending.</comment>
