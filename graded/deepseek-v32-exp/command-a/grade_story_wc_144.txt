<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her traits as a blind artisan, driving the repair with magnetic calm. However, her competence lacks visible struggle or flaws, slightly reducing depth; no contradictory impulses act in scene, though the final choice is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis with cost in restored trust and renewal, under an Accumulative/Textural lens that holds. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of blindness shapes tactics, with cost legible in the traveler's relief and Elara's satisfaction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with mist, depot, and water features that constrain choice—Elara uses light refraction through water to "see," charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered, integrating into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes of restoring trust escalate through Elara's agency under the Accumulative lens, with cost in her focused effort. However, the escalation is more atmospheric than causal, lacking a tight narrowing of options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of renewal and trust emerges implicitly from repair actions and symbols, with subtext in the drone's hum and anchor imagery. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, sensory-rich prose reflects Elara's blindness. No head-hopping; voice modulates with pressure, and elision (e.g., light refraction) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with strong propulsion, though minor overwriting in phrases like "mosaic of glass and liquid" slightly blurs sense. No loops or scaffolds; figurative language is consistent and closure-unaffected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of blind artisan using alternative senses feels inevitable, with risk in poetic style heightening stakes. Tropes are transformed through specific details like water features, and closure reinforces freshness.</comment>
