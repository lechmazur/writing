<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in spiritual curiosity, with embodied emotions (trembling hands, slowed breath) and micro-choices under pressure. The final healing feels earned by her active pursuit, though internal contradictions are subtle rather than pronounced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost ("memories no longer weighed on her"), underpinned by a coherent Causal lens. The viaduct and pendant act as persistent constraints that shape tactics, and orientation is anchored early within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and POV-filtered, with sensory details (wisteria scent, cool iron) that pressure choices. The viaduct and pendant constrain action and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding unused love) escalates through Elara's agency under the Causal lens, from discovering the pendant to placing it. Cost is legible in the healing warmth, though the conflict remains internal without external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through symbols (Kwan Yin's tear, sparks) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—love stored within—that reweights prior material, but leans slightly on spiritual abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively lyrical, reflecting Elara's artistic perception. No dialogue, but prose maintains rhythmic control under pressure, with purposeful elision (e.g., memory fragments) that pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("skeletal ribcage draped in wisteria") serves atmosphere and propulsion, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements like the camera obscura artist and pilgrim of sparks create a fresh synthesis, though the spiritual journey trope is transformed rather than groundbreaking. Specificity in setting and object use elevates originality.</comment>
