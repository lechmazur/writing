<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal internal conflict. Her final realization of home as an internal state is earned through causal actions with visible cost. However, minor diagnostic language in peaks, such as "the pain of remembering was not a curse but a catalyst," slightly reduces immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Elara achieves wholeness, under a causal lens where her actions drive the outcome. Cost is legible in the storm's break and quiet strength, with the stone as a persistent constraint. Orientation is clear early, and the structure is tight with no gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated, with the labyrinthine bookstore and stone constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as the stone's warmth and shifting symbols. The environment evolves causally with Elara's actions, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency, as her use of the stone narrows options and deepens understanding, with cost felt in the confrontation of pain. Under the causal lens, pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully. The dominant stake of understanding home is signaled early and resolved with trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in the stone as a mirror to self. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to home as internal harmony, without moralizing. Recurring motifs like the feather are charged and reweighted at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, fluid perceptual signature that reflects Elara's seer nature. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and elision (e.g., the feather's texture) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peaks. Sentence-level propulsion advances story and character, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the synthesis of familiar elements (seer, bookstore) into a specific, inevitable arc focused on internal home. Risk-taking in poetic introspection heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth avoids templates, and the premise is transformed through character.</comment>
