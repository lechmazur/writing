<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to nurture wonder is clear and consistent, embodied in micro-choices like taking Finn's hand. Finn's shift from fear to curiosity feels earned, though interior contradiction is minimal. The final renunciation of the telescope lands with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative lens, with Finn's perspective shift ("the universe had revealed itself") legible as cost. Orientation is clear early, and the eclipse motif pays off without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory details like the "grass seemed to glow" are selective and purposeful. The keepsake curl functions as micro-setting, charging the final image by mirroring the eclipse's corona and symbolizing ordinary magic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of fostering wonder escalates through Elara's agency in the shared moment, narrowing Finn's options under the accumulative lens. Cost is felt in his abandoned telescope and "newfound curiosity."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of ordinary magic emerges through concrete particulars like the curl's glow, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Finn's transformed perception.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice ("the hush of dreaming roots"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in Finn's "How did you do that?" Elision is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts. Figurative language like "as if each one were a note" is coherent and supports pressure. No loops or scaffold issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept of ordinary magic synthesizes familiar elements with freshness through specific details like the cracked telescope. The quiet ending takes risks but coheres, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
