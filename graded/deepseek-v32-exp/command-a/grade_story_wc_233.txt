<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Queen's motivation is clear and rooted in dreams and warnings, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final vow is earned by her journey, but interior contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced, limiting peak impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly from dreams to climb to revelation. Closure lands with cost in her vow and the grotto's sigh, a Resonant Reconfiguration that forecloses her disenchantment with visible responsibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (e.g., "gravel path," "pulsing light") are purposefully selective and POV-filtered. The grotto as environment constrains choices in the labyrinth and charges the final image with its softened glow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal mystery to world-balance responsibility under causal lens, driven by queen's agency. Cost is legible in her heart-sinking realization and vow, though the transition is swift for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of balance and responsibility emerges through concrete events like the starlight revelation, not statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the fireflies' light remaining in her heart.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled. Minimal dialogue serves subtext, but psychic distance is consistent without innovative modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("waterfall of molten silver") enhances clarity without muddle, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept of bleeding starlight as lifeblood is a fresh synthesis, transforming fantasy tropes through specific world logic. Emotional specificity in the queen's arc avoids template plots, though risk-taking is moderate.</comment>
