<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving key choices like stepping into the furnace. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "luminous regret"), and her final resolve is earned through prior causality. Micro-choices under pressure reveal values, but slight abstraction in her epiphany prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost ("quiet resolve" replacing regret), under an Accumulative lens that builds density through visions. Orientation is clear early, and the zodiac coin persistently shapes tactics. No causality breaks; the ending reweights prior material indelibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the foundry constraining choice (e.g., furnace scene) and charging the final image. Sensory details like "damp metal and herbs" are filtered through POV, but minor reliance on visual senses limits the score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes in understanding names escalate through Elara's agency (e.g., entering furnace), narrowing options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in her softened regret, though the escalation relies more on internal shift than external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of balance and redemption emerges through particulars like kintsugi and coin visions, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior material, but subtext occasionally edges toward explicit theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice remains consistent under pressure, though absence of dialogue limits evaluation of indirection or character distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, but minor template cadence in descriptive passages prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of alchemy, zodiac, and kintsugi feels inevitable, with specific details elevating familiarity. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure image is freshly charged.</comment>
