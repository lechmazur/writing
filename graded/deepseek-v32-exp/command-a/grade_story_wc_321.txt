<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to higher-stakes choices like stepping into the rift. Her resilient positivity is embodied through actions and dialogue, but internal contradiction is minimal, limiting depth. The final choice to reset time is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her weakening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—time reset—and felt cost as Mara collapses, under a causal lens that holds throughout. The hourglass as a persistent constraint shapes tactics, and orientation is anchored early without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The spectral grotto and hourglass constrain choices and charge the final image, with vivid sensory details integrated into action. Setting pressures Mara's decisions, such as stepping into the rift, and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from investigation to rift journey under Mara's agency, with cost legible in her bodily strain. The dominant stake of saving the ferry tightens through her choices, though the reset feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of resilience and transience emerges through events and images, like the filled hourglass, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal reweighting, but lacks profound ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, and dialogue feels natural. Perceptual signature is consistent, but voice modulation under pressure is adequate without standout rhythm control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, and syntax varies naturally, supporting momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes time rifts and resilience with specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the concept is fully committed to.</comment>
