<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices like wrestling the journal hardening his resolve. His transformation from surveyor to keeper is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in raw hands and soaked clothes. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a hybrid drive lens with causal linkages (finding journal leads to repairs) and accumulative deepening. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with the glowing mosaic, legible cost in Elias's effort, and orientation anchored early. The lens holds without ambiguity, and the ending reweights meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details like brine scent and damp sand filtering through Elias's POV. The submerged pavilion constrains choices, forcing wading and discovery, and charges the final image with the glowing mosaic. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resurrecting dreams is signaled early; escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the hybrid lens, from finding the journal to repairs, narrowing options. Cost is legible in physical strain and emotional lightness, but the escalation lacks a major reversal, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of interlaced absence and dream resurrection emerges organically through images like reaching hands and the journal, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the glowing mosaic, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic diction like "hushed blaze." Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and elision is purposeful. No dialogue, but internal coherence is strong; minor rhythmic consistency prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, avoiding muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere, and closure image is clear with purposeful compression.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes surveying with dream archeology freshly, transformed through specific details like the inkwell and journal. Risk-taking in lyric closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional specificity avoids templates. Some familiarity with exploration tropes limits originality.</comment>
