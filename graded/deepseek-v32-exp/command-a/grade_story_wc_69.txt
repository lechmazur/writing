<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot from resignation to action. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like "expectantly resigned," and her final realization is earned through prior causality. However, her characterization lacks deep internal contradiction, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with clear orientation and closure—the choir's performance reconfigures the rosette's meaning as a beacon of hope. Cost is legible in the replaced silence, but the escalation relies slightly on symbolic convenience rather than relentless pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the velvet library and autumn light filtering through stained glass creating atmosphere that pressures Elara's choices. The rosette as a micro-setting object constrains actions and charges the final image, elevating the score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes around preserving harmony escalate through Elara's agency in subtracting noise, leading to the choir's growth and performance. Cost is unmistakable in the applause silencing indifference, though the conflict lacks multi-layered tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of harmony through subtraction emerges organically from events and images, like the rosette's transformation, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting the vanishing arts as rediscoverable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice that reflects Elara's perception. Dialogue is minimal but natural, and prose rhythm supports emotional beats without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet clear, with high information density and varied sentence rhythm. No significant artifacts like loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise feels fresh with its focus on subtracting noise for harmony, transforming the trope of an inspiring teacher through specific details like the rosette. Synthesis is inevitable in hindsight, though it leans on familiar emotional arcs.</comment>
