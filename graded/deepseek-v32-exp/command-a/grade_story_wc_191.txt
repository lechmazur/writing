<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, driving key choices like uncovering murals and solving the mechanism. However, internal conflict is underdeveloped, with emotions like "heart quickened" leaning toward stock phrasing. The final renunciation of power for understanding is earned but lacks deep contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages from murals to archway solution. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing via the throne's collective wisdom revelation, with cost legible in Lira's fulfilled role. Orientation is anchored early, and no causality breaks occur, though the climax feels slightly summarized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with pulsating fruit and bioluminescent vines, constraining choices like the waterfall hiding the cavern. The ruby flake and throne charge the final image, and sensory details are purposeful, though visual dominance slightly limits other senses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding the stairway escalates through Lira's agency in uncovering murals and unlocking the archway. Cost is legible in her ascent and realization, foreclosing personal power. One meaningful tightening occurs, but pressure coheres without multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of collective wisdom emerges organically from Lira's journey, with subtext in the throne's redefinition. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though it leans slightly toward earned platitude rather than raw complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with consistent perceptual signature, and prose texture is distinct. No dialogue present, but elision is taught and paid off. Minor register drift in phrases like "otherworldly light" doesn't harm clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with good rhythm, but decorative metaphors like "air shimmered with hues" and template cadence in "she worked faster, uncovering more scenes" cause minor artifacts. No loops obscure closure, though density is uneven.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh specifics like the ruby flake's role, feeling inevitable. Risk-taking in the quiet, conceptual closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, but derivative premise guardrail applies slightly.</comment>
