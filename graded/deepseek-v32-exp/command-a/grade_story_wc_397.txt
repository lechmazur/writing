<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as a euthanasia tourist is clear and intensifies through her interactions, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. Her final realization feels earned by prior causality, though some interiority edges toward abstraction without full contradiction in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Elara's shifted perspective. Orientation is solid early, and the structure coheres with a meaningful deepening that reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail and constrains choices, charging the final image of the northern lights. It functions as a micro-setting that pressures tactics and enriches atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding endings) escalates through Elara's agency in dialogue and reflection, narrowing options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in her altered grip on reality, though escalation is subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence emerges through concrete images and events, with subtext in gestures like the parasol's reprise. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, rooted in particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present, and elision is purposeful without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic control and high information density, though minor figurative density in peaks doesn't obscure clarity. No loops or scaffold artifacts; sentence-level propulsion supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The euthanasia tourist concept offers a fresh angle, synthesized with specific setting and character details. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
