<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his traits; his inadvertent stubbornness drives key choices, and his emotional arc from weariness to peace is earned through concrete actions. The final renunciation of his old way of giving rest is credible and charged with cost, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly with because/therefore linkages from the package to the library search and lens assembly; closure is a decisive change with felt cost as Elias's weariness lifts, and the lens as a persistent constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory details like damp stone and seaweed, constraining choices as Elias searches for fragments in impossible spaces; the underwater library charges the final image with the lens's glow, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of giving rest escalates through Elias's agency in searching for lens fragments, narrowing options and culminating in a cost-legible act of sending the signal; pressure coheres under the causal lens with no coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of rest and resilience emerges organically from the lens's reassembly and the city's stories, with subtext in the "light within depths"; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive voice that filters setting through Elias's priorities; no head-hopping or register drift, and elision (e.g., the package's origin) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or artifacts; sentences advance story and atmosphere, such as "the water outside began to shimmer," and figurative language is coherent and purposeful in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes undertaker, underwater city, and lighthouse lens with fresh specificity; emotional truth avoids tropes, and the closure reconfiguration feels inevitable due to established pattern and character choice, earning a risk bonus.</comment>
