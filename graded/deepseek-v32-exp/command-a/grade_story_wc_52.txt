<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to harvest lessons from loss is clear and rooted in consistent traits, driving her to carve the lion. Interiority is concrete and embodied, such as fingers tracing the carving blank, with internal conflict shown in grappling with grief. The final choice to find peace is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the reconfigured understanding of "here and gone." No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies detract from the characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Elara's realization that she has contained resilience. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with pattern intensification through carving and reflection. Orientation is clear within 120 words, anchoring who, where, and when. No causality breaks; the ending reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like rain-beaded skylight and metal bucket, constraining choice as the loft sanctuary guides Elara's actions. The ash wood carving blank functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection reflects urgency, narrowed to immediacies under stress. Environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of internal conflict with grief escalates under the Accumulative lens through Elara's agency in carving and reflection. A meaningful deepening occurs as she applies "here and gone" to her sorrow, narrowing options with cost legible in the final image. Pressure coheres and tightens once, driven by protagonist choices. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of "here and gone" emerges through events and images, not direct statement, with subtext in the carving representing transience. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the completed lion, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete through scene work, avoiding sentimentality. Complexity embraces ambiguity in grief and resilience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic prose and selective attention to details like the carving grain. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, maintaining consistency under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure. Dialogue is absent, so not evaluated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; clarity is maintained even in peak beats. Syntax and diction are controlled and voice-motivated, with strong verbs and specific nouns. Read-aloud ear test passes with natural variation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality lies in the specific synthesis of widow, carving, and "here and gone" concept, feeling organic and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices in character and theme. Risk-taking in quiet, internal story heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh inflection in the final reconfiguration avoids derivative premises.</comment>
