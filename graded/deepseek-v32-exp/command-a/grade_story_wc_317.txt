<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to safeguard innovation is clear and consistent, driving his choices like planting the seed and dropping the key. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions (e.g., "heart pounding"), but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure, making his arc slightly rational. Micro-choices reveal values, and the final commitment to the chamber is earned, though cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages from seed to key to hidden door. Closure is a decisive change (chamber discovery) with cost legible in Elias stepping into the unknown, reconfiguring his purpose. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraints (key, brook) shape tactics. No causality breaks, but the resolution feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the brook and haven constraining choices (e.g., brook reveals door). Sensory details (moonlight, murmur) are selective and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment charges the final image. Micro-setting (seed, key) evolves meaningfully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safeguarding innovation) escalates through Elias's agency under causal lens, from seed to key to door. Cost is legible in the foreclosed path of ordinary mystery-solving. One meaningful tightening (key drop) narrows options, driven by protagonist choice, though stakes remain abstract at times.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of mystery and innovation emerges through events and images (seed, key, chamber) without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the chamber as new purpose. However, thematic depth is slightly limited by the protagonist's single-minded focus.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (poetic, contemplative). Voice modulates with pressure (e.g., rhythmic prose in climax). No head-hopping; elision (e.g., "orthogonal approaches") is taught but slightly jarring. Dialogue absent, so not evaluated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with varied rhythm and high information density, but minor overwriting (e.g., "orthogonal approaches" feels register-drifted) and repetitive stems ("storm-born silence") cause slight artifacts. No major loops or scaffold; closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality is high with fresh synthesis of mystery seed mail and escape room tropes through specific details. Turns feel earned, and risk-taking (lyric tone) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise is transformed through character-driven choices, making it inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
