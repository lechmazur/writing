<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final choice to activate the valve wheel is earned by prior causality, with visible cost as she overcomes skepticism and finds peace. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her skepticism wavering when faced with evidence, deepening character complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, the plot advances with because/therefore linkages, leading to a decisive change where Mara frees the trapped souls, achieving closure with felt cost (weight lifting from her chest). Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with no causality breaks, satisfying the 9+ quick test with persistent constraints shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly described with sensory details (damp earth, rusted metal) that pressure choices and charge the final image; the valve wheel as a micro-setting object constrains Mara's action and is integral to the climax. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details are filtered through her POV, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Causal lens, from finding the valve wheel to activating the machine, with cost legible in her facing fears and achieving closure. The dominant stake of truth-seeking tightens meaningfully, though the climax's cost could be more visceral, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, such as the ghost shift representing swallowed truth, with subtext in Mara's skepticism versus belief. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, but some thematic elements feel slightly overt, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, and prose reflects Mara's mindset under pressure. Voice remains consistent, though dialogue is minimal; elision is taught and paid off, but minor register stability issues prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats, and sentence-level propulsion supports momentum without obscuring causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The concept of a factory ghost shift is fresh and synthesized with personal quest, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in blending supernatural and emotional arcs heightens stakes without gimmickry, though it leans on familiar tropes slightly, limiting uniqueness.</comment>
