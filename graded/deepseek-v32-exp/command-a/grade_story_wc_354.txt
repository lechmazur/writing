<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alara's motivation is clear and rooted in her exile, with embodied emotion (e.g., worry stone's weight) and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation of exile as punishment is earned through the chess pattern, though some interiority edges toward abstraction in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Decisive Change (returning as a guide) and felt cost (toppling the king). Causal lens holds via nexus amplification and chess moves; orientation is anchored early with who, where, and when.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting (magnetic nexus) pressures choices by amplifying thoughts, and micro-settings (chessboard, worry stone) constrain actions. Sensory details (humming air, twilight) are selective and purposeful, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Alara's agency under the causal lens, with stakes in silencing vs. understanding tightening through the chess game. Cost is legible in the knight's sacrifice and king's toppling, foreclosing past attachments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of silence as a bridge emerges through concrete events (chess translation, exile recall) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting the covenant as a challenge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (poetic, deliberate). Voice remains coherent under pressure, and elision (e.g., nexus pulses) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Minor overwriting in descriptive phrases (e.g., "fleeting beauty") does not harm propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes exile and chess uniquely, with specific details (worry stone, nexus) making it organic. Risk-taking in quiet resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry, though not fully transformative.</comment>
