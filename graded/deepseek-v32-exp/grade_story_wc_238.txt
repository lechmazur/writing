<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Elara functions as a competent technician rather than a character under pressure; she encounters no internal resistance or doubt. Her "belief in imperfect miracles" is stated as backstory rather than dramatized through a difficult choice or personal cost in the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative moves linearly from setup to resolution without a causal turn or complication to test the protagonist's plan. While closure is legible, the sequence relies on a mechanical "and then" progression where the device and perfume work instantly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The atmosphere of the archive and the "profound hush" of the orchard is evocative and anchors the scene well. However, the "dew-like script" on the petal pushes the specific reality of the setting into stylized whimsy that clashes with the established "medical device" grounding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>There is no escalation or active opposition; the ghosts cooperate immediately, and the deadline of dawn exerts no pressure on the actual procedure. The protagonist achieves her goal without facing a reversal or paying a price that alters her tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The theme of "imperfect miracles" is explicitly stated but contradicted by the outcome, which features a tidy, supernatural confirmation of forgiveness. The ending resolves the conflict too neatly to support the "messy, human means" thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and polished, maintaining a suitable melancholic tone. It effectively filters the scene through Elara's perspective, though it occasionally leans on summary ("words gritty with the effort") rather than showing the struggle.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Prose is competent and clear, with some strong sensory details ("scent of aged paper"). However, it relies heavily on adjective-noun pairings ("profound hush," "mournful sonata," "tangible memory") that soften the impact of the action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The "gossip-column exorcist" concept is a compelling hook, but the execution settles into a standard ghost reconciliation story. The resolution feels familiar and lacks a fresh twist or reconfiguration of the genre tropes.</comment>
