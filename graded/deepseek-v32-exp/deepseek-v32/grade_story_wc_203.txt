<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Leo’s motivation is clear and rooted in a specific trait (observant, sees ghosts), driving his choices. Interiority is concrete ("weightless burden"), but internal conflict is minimal; he is competent and calm throughout. His final action (reassembling the mechanism) is earned and carries cost, though contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with clear because/therefore linkages. Closure is a decisive change (ghost freed, Leo gains purpose) with on-page cost in the acceptance of his burden. Orientation is immediate; structure is a single scene with one meaningful tightening. The ghost’s exposition is straightforward but functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the abandoned ticket office’s dust, cracks, and ceiling compartment directly drive discovery. Sensory details (buzzing lights, peeling paint) are selective and atmosphere is cohesive. The environment charges the final image of what ceilings hide. High-band capped due to Q2 gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering hidden pasts) is signaled early and escalates through Leo’s agency—inspecting, engaging, reassembling. Pressure tightens via the ghost’s appearance and hidden mechanism. Cost is legible but quiet (burden accepted). One meaningful turn suffices under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of hidden burdens and repair emerges through concrete particulars (ceiling compartments, mainspring barrel). Subtext operates in image and action, though the final paragraph articulates purpose somewhat directly. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Leo’s observant perception. Voice is distinct, with a poetic yet controlled texture ("weightless burden"). Dialogue is minimal but natural; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent and supports pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is clean, with varied syntax and effective imagery. Information density is high; sentences advance plot or character without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent. Minor purple phrasing does not obscure clarity. High-band capped due to Q2 gate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes mundane occupation (elevator repair) with supernatural ability in a fresh, specific way. Details (circus horologist, dust analysis) feel organic and non-generic. Turns are earned through established character traits. Some trope familiarity is elevated by grounded execution.</comment>
