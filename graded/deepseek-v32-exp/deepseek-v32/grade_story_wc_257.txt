<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Silas's grief and curiosity are embodied through specific micro-choices; his transformation from performance to purposeful weaving of mourning is earned by the journey, with cost visible in the final act of giving.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Silas watches the woman see light differently; causal lens holds through clear linkages from parcels to observatory to gift, with cost legible in the integrated grief.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through Silas's craft; the tattoo stencil and Timeless Observatory constrain choices and charge the final image, where the band projects the stencil's pattern onto skin.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Silas's agency—from curiosity to meditation to creation—tightening his options; cost is felt in his personal integration of decay and renewal, driving the final gift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of endings as origins emerges through concrete images (vine design, observatory visions); the final image offers a non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting mourning as artful design.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Silas's jeweler mindset; lyrical prose modulates with emotional intensity, and elision (e.g., journey through intention) is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without loops or scaffold; figurative language ("dragonfly's wing," "genuinely artificial solemnity") is consistent and heightens pressure, clarity intact through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mourning jewelry, origami clues, and metaphysical observatory feels organic; risk-taking with perceptual settings heightens stakes without gimmickry, and transformation feels inevitable.</comment>
