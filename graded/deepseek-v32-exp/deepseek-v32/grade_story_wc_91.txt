<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Aris's contradictory impulses (giving while destitute) are shown, and his final renunciation (releasing the bugs) is earned with visible cost. Some interiority leans abstract ("texture of transformation"), but micro-choices under pressure remain character-specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost (releasing last treasure for clarity). Accumulative/textural lens holds; orientation is clear early. Prophecy integration avoids deus ex machina by serving thematic coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (black sand, volcano, celestial dance) is vivid and selective. The jars as recurring objects constrain choice (placement, release) and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding transformation) escalates via density increase under accumulative lens. Aris's agency (detour, placing jars, releasing bugs) drives deepening; cost is unmistakable in the release of his last treasure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images and actions, not statement. The final realization ("gritty like sand...") reweights prior material without moralizing, though slight thematic echo in Aris's epiphany tempers the score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with lyrical voice consistent throughout. Perceptual signature is distinct; dialogue (fisherwoman) is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with varied syntax; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled, though occasional purpling ("mirrors of his own diminished hope") does not obscure clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of destitute philanthropist, accidental prophecy, and volcanic setting feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative plot heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
