<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; her feisty persistence drives the search. Interiority is concrete, with micro-choices (fingering the ribbon, opening the bag) revealing character under pressure. The final renunciation of rigid vows is earned by the journal's discovery and ritual, with visible cost in the breach. Minor label-use ("endearingly feisty") does not undercut the closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: breach of contract motivates refuge, finding the journal enables ritual, vision leads to renewed purpose. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in "freed her from rigid expectations." Orientation is anchored early. Slight convenience in journal discovery is offset by setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the cathedral orchard supplies ritual elements and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's POV. The micro-setting (bag, journal) actively shapes tactics. No postcard description; environment is integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (true vision, bridging wisdom) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under causal lens: finding journal, performing ritual. Cost is legible in the shedding of old vows and the freedom from Guild expectations. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of deciduous vows emerges from particulars (journal, ritual, vision) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: true vision as a living tapestry. Subtext operates in images and implications. Slight echo in "accidental wisdom" but not disruptive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature. No head-hopping. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, remaining consistent under pressure. No dialogue; prose rhythm supports the reflective tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion matches scene needs. Closure image is clear and charged. No artifacts that obscure causality or dull the ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of quartz-eye mender, cathedral orchard, and deciduous vows feels organic and specific. Premise offers a fresh angle; turns are earned through character choice. Risk-taking in quiet, reflective plot heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passed.</comment>
