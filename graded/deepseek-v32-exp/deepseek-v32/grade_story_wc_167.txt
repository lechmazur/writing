<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elan's motivation to "illuminate value in the mundane" is concrete and drives his investigative choice. His interiority is specific (hands skilled at reading fractures), and his final micro-choice to install the etched pane as a relic is a credible, value-revealing endurance. However, his realization via the pond feels slightly swift, a minor compression of struggle that prevents a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is clear and held. Orientation is immediate. Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing: the etched glass casting a spectral map reweights the premise of value and perception. Cost is legible in the preservation of the old pane as a relic and the transient, knowing watchfulness of the ending. One hairline slip: the pond epiphany's mechanics are somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and deeply integrated. The Prism Atrium, the mist, the brackish pond, and the old glass all constrain choice and crucially charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Elan's professional POV. The environment is a direct tool for the thematic revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a deepening of perception. The dominant stake (understanding the hidden message) tightens through Elan's active investigation (finding text, pond ritual). Agency is in attention and interpretation, culminating in the installation choice, which forecloses simple replacement and carries the cost of preserving mystery. The pressure coheres and reweights meaning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly through image and action, not statement. The core idea—value seen in subtle, hidden light—is earned through the etched text, the ripple patterns, and the final spectral map. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in Elan's dialogue ("some light is meant for reading") and the fading pattern, avoiding moralizing. It reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, controlled, and perfectly matched to the accumulative, reflective POV. The prose has a measured, luminous texture. POV is stable and filters perception through Elan's glazier sensibility. The brief dialogue is natural and serves thematic closure. A minor restraint prevents a 9+ score: the voice is slightly uniform in its polish.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and largely free of artifacts. Sentences do multiple jobs (character, setting, theme). There is a slight risk of abstraction in phrases like "noctilucent reckonings," but the concrete imagery anchors it. No loops or scaffold. The final paragraph's rhythm expertly supports the closure. A few moments of elevated diction near the concept keep it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis is fresh and inevitable: a glazier's trade, etched historical messages, and ripple-pattern epistemology cohere into a singular vision. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded detail (salt-caked windows, lead lines, brackish pond). The risk of a quiet, perceptual climax pays off with a resonant conceptual repricing.</comment>
