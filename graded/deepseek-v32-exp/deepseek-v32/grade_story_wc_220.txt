<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Arlo's motivation is clear, rooted in consistent traits, and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete and embodied (e.g., "heart weary from its scent"). The final acceptance is earned by prior causality with visible cost. No contradictory impulses in scene, but the renunciation is well-motivated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a decisive change (finding the photograph) with felt cost on the page ("the distance between past and present collapsed"). Orientation is clear within 120 words; the riddle's solving drives a logical, earned progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices (the wasteland, the scrapyard). The autumn leaf and phonograph cylinder function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (closeness to the past) is signaled early and escalates through Arlo's agency (deciphering the riddle). One meaningful tightening (the leaf insight) narrows options; cost is legible in the acceptance of loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and acceptance emerges through concrete images (leaf, cylinder, photograph) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer; subtext operates in the riddle and the note "Find me in the quiet places."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Arlo's intuitive descriptive perception. Voice has a distinct lyrical texture that matches his mindset; no head-hopping; rhythmic control supports pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm; zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful; sentences advance story, character, or atmosphere without overwriting. Closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic tropes through specific, grounded details (phonograph cylinder, preserved leaf). Emotional truth is specific; the premise is transformed by character-driven choices. Risk-taking in quiet resolution heightens stakes.</comment>
