<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. However, internal contradiction is minimal, limiting depth; his obliging nature doesn't strongly conflict with his goal, though the final choice is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with on-page cost (sensor reconfiguration) under a causal lens, oriented early. The nexus as persistent constraint shapes tactics, and the lever-pull decisively changes understanding with felt conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through POV, with the nexus and holographic tools constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, integrating seamlessly with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving time moves sideways) escalates via Aris's agency under causal pressure; the lever-pull tightens options with legible cost in paradigm shift and sensor reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and imagery, with subdued awakenings and sideways time offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The icy warmth of science reinforces thematic complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a scientific, observant tone. Dialogue advances plot and carries subtext; perceptual signature is consistent, though minor convergence in peak beats limits higher band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled, and syntax accelerates with scene needs; closure image remains clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and synthesizes speculative science with character-driven revelation. Risk-taking in conceptual focus heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
