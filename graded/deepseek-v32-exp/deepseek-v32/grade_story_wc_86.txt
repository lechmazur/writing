<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Aris is a well-realized character with clear motivation and interiority. Her thoughtful nature is shown through concrete actions (the drawer pull) and her final unknotting feels earned. Minor deduction for lack of strong contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single-scene structure with clear orientation; accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a charged poise with cost (the offered drawer pull, the captain's tentative response). Moon phase constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid atmospheric setting (mist, parapet) and the drawer pull as micro-setting object charge the final image. However, the physical environment does not actively constrain choices, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (successful exchange and seeding trust) escalates through Aris's agency (offering the drawer pull). Cost is legible in her forfeiture of the totem and the risk taken.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of opening closed things and recycling mistakes emerges through particulars (drawer pull, moon phases) without moralizing. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and distinct; voice is lyrical yet controlled, with perceptual signature. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Opening line anchors voice effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar elements (prisoner exchange) with a quiet, philosophical gesture. The drawer pull as totem and the contemplative tone feel organic and risk-taking.</comment>
