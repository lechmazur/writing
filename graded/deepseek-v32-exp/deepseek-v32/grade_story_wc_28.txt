<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority leans toward abstract conceptualization ("gentle radical," "aberrant mercy") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The retrocognitive trap creates internal friction, but her management of it feels controlled; the final choice is earned but lacks a visceral, contradictory cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing: renaming mercy as "sheltered strength" reweights the premise with undeniable cost (the "warm coldness" in her bones). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through patterned imagery. Orientation is immediate, and the mosaic pattern teaches the method early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The shattered sky and mosaic plaza are not just backdrop; they constrain choice (the tessera's trap, the stone's patterns) and decisively charge the final image (the sky softening, the stone glowing). Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through Elara's goal-directed perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (mercy vs. harsh justice) are signaled early. Pressure escalates via the unbidden retrocognitive visions, which Elara must fight to anchor herself and complete the renaming act—a clear, agentive tightening. The cost is the "warm coldness," a reconfigured emotional state that forecloses simple compassion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the renaming act: mercy must be reconceived as resilient, sheltered strength to survive a broken world. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The "warm coldness" concept beautifully integrates the thematic paradox.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with a distinct poetic-perceptual signature ("shattered sky," "warm coldness"). Diction is consistent and voice-modulated, though it occasionally flirts with abstraction. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., council's rule) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm and information density. Minor scaffold appears ("The renaming done..."; "She had performed...") and a slight synonym loop ("frozen light"/"prismatic glow"/"crystalline edge"), but these do not obscure causality or dull the potent closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—shattered sky, retrocognitive artifact, renaming as a conceptual act—is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The risk of a quiet, concept-driven climax heightens stakes and coheres fully with the story's emotional and thematic logic.</comment>
