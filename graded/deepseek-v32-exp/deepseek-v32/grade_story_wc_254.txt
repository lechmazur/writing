<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The poet's aesthetic drive and pursuit of forbidden art are consistently embodied; her tremor of certainty evolves into a steady truth through on-page interaction with the colonnade, earning the final revelation with visible cost in the cracked ice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a conceptual repricing where the permeability of boundaries becomes undeniable, cost legible in the frozen lake's crack; orientation is immediate and anchors the poetic journey.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details—cobalt atrium, quartz hum, frozen lake—filtered through the poet's POV; the colonnade charges the final image, constraining choice and mirroring internal dissolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes of artistic freedom escalate through the poet's agency in paraphrasing the hum; cost is felt in the dissolution of self and art, leading to a transformative realization under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of boundary permeability emerges organically from concrete images and actions; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the cracked ice and carried tremor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with a distinct poetic perceptual signature; voice modulates with emotional intensity, maintaining rhythmic control and clarity under pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical density with high information propulsion; no loops or scaffold, figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off in closure; sentence rhythm supports accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of artistic freedom and natural fusion; specific details like cloud-shadow poet and quartz colonnade create a singular stance, with risk-taking in lyric mode heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
