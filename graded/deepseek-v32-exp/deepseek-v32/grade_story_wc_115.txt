<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Alex's reckless curiosity and religious skepticism are concrete, driving his investigation and final stance crystallization. His drowsy alertness embodies contradictory impulses, and the resolution—speaking to the ghosts—is earned by prior clues and his method. The cost of the swallowed truth is felt as a moral weight lifted. However, minor tells like "He needed to connect the dots" slightly flatten interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal linkages are tight: the psychic radio calls provide clues that lead Alex to the valve wheel and confrontation. Closure lands with decisive change (ghosts fade) and resonant reconfiguration (truth weighed), cost legible in the final moral measurement. The hybrid lens (causal dominant) holds without ambiguity. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph, anchoring who, where, and when.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly selective—damp tunnel, rust, boiler room—and pressures choices via the beaded valve wheel, which constrains focus and charges the final image. Sensory details (smell of wet stone, cold air) reflect Alex's hyper-awareness. The tunnel and mill function as micro-settings that shape tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (weighing the swallowed truth) escalates through Alex's agency: interpreting radio calls, focusing on the valve wheel, confronting the ghost shift. The tightening is causal and meaningful, foreclosing ignorance with a visible cost—the moral burden finally measured. The ghost shift's fade is earned by his acknowledgment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the beaded valve wheel as symbol of ignored responsibility, the radio calls as fragmented memory. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—truth as moral weight—without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence, whispers, and the lingering drowsy alertness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, filtered through Alex's skeptical, investigative perception. Voice is consistent with a descriptive, atmospheric texture. Dialogue is minimal but functional; radio calls are integrated as reported speech. No head-hopping, though the voice lacks exceptional distinctness under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with vivid imagery and varied rhythm. Minor scaffold phrases ("He needed to connect the dots") and a cliché ("chill down his spine") slightly dull peak beats. No loops or artifactual muddle; sentence-level craft supports closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of psychic radio clues with a factory ghost shift feels organic and inevitable. The concept is transformed through specific details (beaded valve wheel, swallowed truth) and Alex's skeptical stance. Risk-taking is moderate but coherent, elevating stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
