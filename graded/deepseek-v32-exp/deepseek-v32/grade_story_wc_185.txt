<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, and the final choice is earned. However, interiority leans toward abstract, thematic phrasing ("hammered repose") rather than concrete, embodied emotion under pressure, limiting the sense of internal contradiction or degraded perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds cleanly. Orientation is immediate and functional. Closure is a decisive change (storm silenced, peace earned) with on-page cost (exhaustion, transformation). The convergent fracture pattern acts as a persistent constraint that shapes the final tactic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and fully integrated into action and choice. The Harmonic Caves and the crack patterns in the ice constrain the protagonist's method and directly enable the climax, charging the final image of settled, luminous quiet.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding quiet) escalates cleanly under the causal lens via the energy beings' invasion, forcing a tactical choice. Kael's agency—using the stone and the cave's harmonics—drives the resolution with a legible cost (exhaustion, a reconfigured world).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between chaotic noise and cultivated silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the "bloom of hush" and the transformed beings, without moralizing or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and controlled with a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature. Some phrases trend abstract ("hammered repose"), but the voice remains consistent and supports pressure. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, purposeful, and rhythmically varied. High information density with no detectable loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene pressure, and the final image lands with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh, specific synthesis of post-apocalyptic and mystical elements. The concept of silence as a weapon, realized through geologic mapping and harmonic resonance, feels inevitable in hindsight and heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
