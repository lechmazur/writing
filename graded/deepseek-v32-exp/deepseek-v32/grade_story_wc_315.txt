<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied (e.g., cold metal anchor), motivation clear under pressure. Micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values. Slight telling in "attentively inventive" label prevents higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly: danger emerges, therefore Aris revises protocol. Closure is a decisive change (alert sent, burden transformed) with cost legible in the final image of the buckle as "testament to the burden carried and shared." Orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice (arbor as cage, glass corridors, corrupted console). The parachute buckle as micro-setting charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve trust) escalates through Aris's agency—reconfiguring array, revising sequence—under causal pressure. Cost is felt in his struggle and past failure. One meaningful tightening (debris field confirmation) narrows options credibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of burden transformed into purpose emerges from particulars (buckle, muscle memory). Slight explicit statement in "watcher's burden not as a curse" leans toward telling, but final image offers resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature—professional, poetic tone ("star-flecked void," "soundless echo"). Voice modulates with pressure, no head-hopping. Elision (radio static) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and density, but repetition of "muscle memory" and "soundless echo" creates mild scaffold loops. No figurative muddle; sentence-level propulsion maintains momentum, though minor redundancy holds score back.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of watcher trope with specific setting (nocturnal arbor) and object (parachute buckle). Emotional truth grounded in Aris's burden; premise feels organic, not derivative. Risk-taking is moderate but effective.</comment>
