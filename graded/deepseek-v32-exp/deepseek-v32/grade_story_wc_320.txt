<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority leans abstract ("serenely electric") rather than embodied contradiction. Lyra's competence is evident, yet the final choice, while earned, lacks a deeply felt on-page cost; her internal state is described, not viscerally conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from climb to revelation. Closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing—the city reconfigured as "a tool, not a tomb"—with legible cost in the transformed understanding of beginnings and endings. The shard of hush's discovery is somewhat convenient but does not break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choice (perigee bending waves, tower as aiming point). The gorge and steel forest create atmosphere, but some details ("fantasy practicality") edge toward decorative telling. The environment successfully charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (tune the signal) escalates cleanly under the causal lens via Lyra's agency: discarding assumptions, employing tools, seeking absence. The cost is conceptual (reconfigured understanding) and legible, though not viscerally punishing. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of finding beginnings in endings emerges organically from action and image, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer—the signal as a "blueprint for creation encoded in destruction." Subtext is rich (Hollywood fragment as trivial anchor), avoiding moralizing or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinctive, with a poetic, speculative perceptual signature ("washed the steel forest in cold, practical light"). Voice modulates purposefully with the quest's progress. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and generally propelled, but shows minor overwriting ("fantasy practicality") and a strained metaphor ("Hollywood star fragment"). No debilitating loops or scaffolds; rhythm supports the contemplative tone. Information density is high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cosmic interpretation, abandoned tech, and philosophical quest feels fresh. The Hollywood star fragment and shard of hush are specific, grounded choices. Some concepts edge toward contrivance, but the overall vision is coherent and committed.</comment>
