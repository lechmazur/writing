<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's obsession is clear and consistent, driving her meticulous actions; interiority is conveyed through selective perception and embodied micro-choices. However, the absence of internal contradiction or conflicting impulses limits the complexity of her characterization, though her single-minded focus fits the accumulative lens. The final endurance (completing the map) is earned by prior causality with a visible cost—her neglected sleep and comfort—legible in the text.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the map completes and the star winks out, with cost felt in her justification of obsession. Orientation is immediate, and the pattern of silence-summarization teaches its own logic, culminating in a decisive shift that reweights the stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and charges the final image: the storm-tossed ridge fort and its "ambered hush" become the canvas for her map, constraining her method and shaping the closure. Sensory details (peeling gilt, star's hum) are filtered through Elara's POV and integrated with action, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation occurs through density increase in silence and the cadence shift of the star winking out, reweighting the dominant stake (mapping the endless night). Protagonist agency is continuous (inscribing, listening), and cost is legible in her neglected comfort and the finality of the completed map.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the concrete action of mapping silence; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the endless night as a charted landscape—without moralizing. Subtext operates through layered images (the booklet's glow, the star's wink) that reweight prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and close; voice has a distinct perceptual signature, with rhythmic control and poetic diction that mirrors Elara's obsession. No head-hopping; purposeful compression (e.g., "summarizing silence") is taught early and pays off at closure, maintaining coherence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with high information density and varied sentence rhythm; figurative language ("ambered hush," "marbled hush") is pattern-taught and reinforces theme. No loops, scaffolding, or artifacts that obscure closure; the final image is sharp and legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of mapping silence as geography is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis; risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details (flaking gold leaf, pebble-shore oracle) feel organic and indispensable, transforming a familiar archetype through grounded particularity.</comment>
