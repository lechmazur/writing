<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and profession-specific ("machinist's insight"), and her motivation to find a middle way is clear and sustained. Her final action (clearing the valve) is a credible micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values (compassionate pragmatism over dogma). However, the emotional embodiment is occasionally stated ("excitement," "fear gripped her") rather than fully rendered through degraded perception under stress, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens is clear and held. Closure is a decisive change (the valve is cleared, the building's "breathing" calms) with a felt cost (the moment of violent tremble and fear). The plot is tightly wound: the pollen clue leads to the vent discovery, which enables the repair. The final resonant reconfiguration (dappled resolve, measured compromise) is earned and legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, actively pressuring the choice. The "breathing" amphitheater constrains action (makes the chain quiver, triggers the violent tremble) and the antique chain charges the final image as a "testament to measured compromise." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (mineral scent, warm air, dull gleam of brass).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (preservation vs. safety) are signaled early and made concrete. Escalation is driven by agency: her measurement leads to discovery, which leads to the risky act of prying up the slab and clearing the valve. The cost is legible in the "sudden, violent tremble" and sifting dust. The tension meaningfully tightens once, though the external conflict (custodians vs. council) remains off-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme (encrypted compassion, measured compromise) emerges organically from action and image, resisting a tidy moral. The final line harmonizes conflicting values through a specific, earned solution, not abstraction. The "antique surveyor's chain" as a "testament to measured compromise" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Avoids thematic echo or final-paragraph moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt, filtered through Elara's professional perception. The prose has a distinct, slightly archaic texture ("slyly heartfelt," "dappled resolve") that fits the setting. Voice remains consistent under pressure. No dialogue present, so those criteria are waived.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, with strong information density. However, moments of slight overwriting or register drift ("slyly heartfelt," "dappled resolve") appear, and a template cadence emerges in "Her motivation was clear, but the path was not." These are minor artifacts that do not touch the clarity of the closure beat but prevent a higher band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The core synthesis—a floodgate machinist in a volcanic amphitheater deciphering a builder's encrypted compassion—is fresh and specific. The resolution feels earned and inevitable in hindsight, transforming a potential engineering puzzle into a character-driven discovery of legacy. It avoids template plotting through grounded, peculiar detail.</comment>
