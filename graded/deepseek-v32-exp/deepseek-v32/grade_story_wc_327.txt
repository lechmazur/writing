<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is singular and clear, driving all choices. The final trade (memories for new sounds) is an Earned Stasis with visible cost. However, interiority leans toward poetic summary ("quietly articulate heart") rather than contradictory, embodied impulses under peak pressure, preventing a 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing: the death of the literal language births a sensory one, with cost legible in "each translation cost him a memory." The accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held perfectly, with the tunnel sequence providing a coherent, charged final unit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. The canyon, bone towers, and tunnel of echoes are not backdrop but active pressure and resource. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and fully filtered through the protagonist's perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through density increase (the labor in the tunnel) and a clear cost (the diamond's curse consuming memories). The dominant stake (preserving essence) is tested and reweighted by the protagonist's agency, though the escalation is more meditative than confrontational.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of translation, loss, and rebirth emerges organically from concrete action and image. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the wind now carries "textures he had encoded"—without moralizing. The integration of concept and emotional truth is seamless.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, controlled, and perfectly matched to the accumulative/textural lens. The perceptual signature ("copper-veined," "quietly articulate") is consistent, and the poetic diction remains within the POV's plausible lexicon. Purity of focalization is maintained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and purposeful with high information density. A minor tendency toward decorative phrasing ("silent sentinels," "layered tapestry") in early beats slightly tempers propulsion, but clarity and momentum are never lost, especially in the crucial tunnel sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements (dying language, sensory translation, cursed object, avian patterns) feels fresh, specific, and inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is fully committed to and followed to its logical, emotionally complex conclusion, avoiding template plotting.</comment>
