<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's whimsical perception and ghostwriter history are concrete, but her abstract motivation ("find the thread") is told more than dramatized in early beats. Her final choice to add the second spiral and embrace connection is earned by her prior actions, with a visible cost in the release of secrets.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as the reunion and added spiral make connection tangible. Cost is legible in the "secret kept and now joyfully released." Minor coincidence of the man's arrival is thematically integrated and complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through Elara's perception and actively constrains choice: the temple base hosts the installation, pond-edge discards become materials. The nest object charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (connection) escalates through Elara's agency in creating the installation, tightening her personal search into a public act. Cost is legible in the transformation from secret-keeper to curator, though the external pressure is mild.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of woven connection emerges through specific images (nest, spiral, sculpture) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "the thread... was the willingness to weave and be woven."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable, close third-person POV with a distinct perceptual signature ("prismatic quiet," seeing water as "spilled kaleidoscope"). Lyrical, whimsical voice remains consistent under pressure, and any elision is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied rhythm. Minor overwriting risk ("prismatic quiet" repetition) is pattern-taught and pays off. No loops or artifacts that obscure closure; sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghostwriter, public art, and spiritual quest feels organic. The whimsical perspective is specific and transforms familiar tropes. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
