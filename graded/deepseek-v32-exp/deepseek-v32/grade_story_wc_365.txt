<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her final choice to shoulder the burden is earned by prior discovery, but interiority sometimes leans abstract ("tangible gravity in her soul") rather than fully embodied contradiction in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly; closure is a decisive change with legible cost. Minor deduction for summarized revelation of the truth, but the on-page resolution and use of the shard anchor the ending effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The abandoned repair bay and green glass shard are vividly specific and functionally constrain choices, charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, fully integrated with the protagonist's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency—using the shard, weaving worlds—to a meaningful tightening where knowledge forces a costly choice. The burden of truth is a felt price that reweights options at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of truth's weight emerges organically from events and images, resisted tidy morals. The final paragraph articulates it somewhat explicitly, but the resonance is earned through prior particulars and the protagonist's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and voice is distinctively lyrical, matching Elara's sensory perception. No dialogue; prose texture and rhythmic control support pressure without head-hopping or distance issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally dense and propulsive with varied syntax, though occasional abstract phrasing ("weight of a withheld truth") slightly mutes immediacy. No major artifacts or loops; closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concept of a sensory map maker weaving between worlds is fresh and synthesized with specific, grounded choices. The shard's transformation and the mentor's sacrifice feel organic, not derivative, and risk lyrical style without gimmickry.</comment>
