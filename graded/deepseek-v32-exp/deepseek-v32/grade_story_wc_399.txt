<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and his dual nature is symbolized by the mask, but interior contradiction and embodied emotion are underdeveloped; he functions more as a competent archetype than a deeply flawed individual, though his micro-choices are purposeful.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with subtle cost in the mask removal and honesty; orientation is immediate and the ritual progression is coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory-rich setting that constrains choice (clearings, parapet) and charges the final image; the murmuring pavilion and kinetic parapet are integral to the story's logic and tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving the echo) is clear and the accumulative progression tightens focus, but escalation is gentle and the cost, while conceptually present, is not viscerally felt or tested by complications.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of duality and preservation emerges organically through images and action; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though it leans slightly toward abstract wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical third-person POV with a distinct perceptual signature (peripheral awareness); the prose rhythm and diction are controlled and enhance the accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elegant, dense prose with varied syntax and no observable loops or artifacts; sentences advance story and atmosphere with poetic precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh, inventive concepts (line walker, kinetic parapet, conjured clearings) are synthesized into an organic whole; the half-mask duality and ritual process feel uniquely imagined.</comment>
