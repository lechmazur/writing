<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interior contradiction ("furiously tranquil") is embodied in scene. Final choice to write and descend earned by prior causality with visible cost in her emotional struggle. Minor hairline slip: "furious tranquility" edges toward label-speak but is immediately grounded in concrete action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; orientation anchored early. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she writes a line and descends with reconfigured understanding. Cost legible in the storm's peak and her settled calm. Timer and envelope create a persistent constraint that shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly selective and pressures choice: observatory isolates, storm mirrors internal state, and dome's reflection charges the final image. Environment constrains action (timer ritual) and supplies resources (solitude, lightning) that affect outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding scars) escalates via timer countdown and storm's peak under accumulative lens. Agency in setting timer and writing line forecloses prior paralysis with visible cost in her emotional war. One meaningful tightening sufficient, though escalation is more internal than causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: scars as channels for light, silence as speech. Subtext in timer and storm imagery. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; earned through her struggle and the envelope's cryptic line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetically controlled yet filters through Elara's bias. Rhythm modulates with storm intensity. No head-hopping; purposeful compression (e.g., "vigil in pause") taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("storm-kissed wonder") is consistent and supports pressure. Minor overwriting in phrases like "furious tranquility" but clarity and propulsion maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of censored poet, observatory, and darkroom timer feels inevitable; tropes transformed through specific detail. Risk-taking in internal, lyric escalation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth anchors originality.</comment>
