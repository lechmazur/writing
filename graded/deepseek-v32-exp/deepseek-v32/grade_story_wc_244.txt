<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with his "desperately jocular" demeanor effectively masking interior contradiction. His micro-choices (e.g., approaching the hesitant woman) reveal hierarchy of values, and his shift from forced smile to genuine amusement feels earned. Minor deduction for occasional label-like interiority ("hollow ache").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly: Aris's actions (spreading rumors, hosting event) directly cause the station's transformation. Closure is a decisive change with on-page cost—the station "hummed with connection" and Aris's demeanor "softened into genuine amusement." Orientation is immediate and the single-scene structure is tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is a crucible: the ivy-clad station functions as command center and catalyst. The moon rock fragment is a recurring object that constrains choice (it's passed hand-to-hand) and charges the final image when placed on the city map. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Aris's logistical mind.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (curing loneliness) escalates through protagonist agency as Aris facilitates introductions, using the moon rock to catalyze exchanges. The cost is legible in his emotional shift and the tangible success of the gathering. One meaningful tightening (the event's growth) forecloses his isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocity emerges organically through the moon rock's journey and the "polite anarchy" of the gathering. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the image of the rock as a "paper weight for new plans." Minor deduction for near-thematic statements like "loneliness was the foundational disaster."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with a distinct perceptual signature—Aris's logistical mind maps "networks of potential friendship." Voice modulates effectively under pressure, though some lyrical descriptions edge toward a uniform cadence. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying subtext in exchanges.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("desperately jocular," "jocular desperation") and a slightly over-stacked metaphor ("iron ribs strangled by ivy"). These artifacts create minor drag but do not obscure causality or the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis: a disaster-relief logistician combatting loneliness through rumor chains and a moon-rock talisman. The premise is fully committed to and transformed through specific, grounded details. The "polite anarchy" tone and conceptual risk-taking heighten stakes without becoming gimmicky.</comment>
