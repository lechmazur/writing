<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistently drives her actions; her calm intuition is embodied, and her final choice is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her transformed shadow-lace.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal plot with coherent linkages; closure lands with a decisive change as peace is forged, and cost is legible in the warm fragment and reconfigured wisdom.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy and empathetic peacekeeping; the vintage store mirrors add a non-obvious angle that coheres with the emotional logic.</comment>
