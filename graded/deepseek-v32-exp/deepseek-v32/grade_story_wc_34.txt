<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and drives the plot, but internal conflict is minimal, and she lacks flaws, reducing depth. However, her actions are consistent, and the change is earned through the storm's pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal plot with tight because/therefore linkages; closure lands decisively with the ghost integrated and Lyra's new song, cost felt in the physical strain and risk. Orientation is early, and the storm timeframe persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The misty courtyard and storm create a vivid atmosphere; the flower press bolt plate as a micro-setting tool constrains choice and charges the final image with its warm iron. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of articulating needs escalates through the shortening interval between lightning and thunder, driven by Lyra's agency. Cost is unmistakable in the thunder's physical blow and her hurried actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of communication through art emerges implicitly from glyph encoding and ghost's response; subtext in the silent dialogue leads to a resonant ending with Lyra's new song and the ghost listening, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature reflects Lyra's tinkersong wonder, and rhythmic control enhances pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures and no loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and clear, supporting momentum and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost story with technological code and art-based communication; specific details like the flower press bolt plate and tinkersong wonder create a fresh, inevitable feel with risk-taking in lyrical magic.</comment>
