<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, with micro-choices under pressure (drawing the bell, outlining the plan). His calm persistence contrasts with community distrust, and the final choice to ring the bell is earned by prior causality. However, interior contradiction is minimal; he is more resolved than torn, which limits depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly: donations lead to investigation, deduction, and reciprocal plan. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with legible cost—using reserves and risking exposure. Orientation is immediate; the two-shard structure (meeting then aftermath) is seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory details (weak moonlight, cold bell, woven vines) are selective and atmospheric. The terra-cotta arbor and ridge establish isolation, but environment doesn't heavily constrain choice. The bell as object charges the final image, lending specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (community survival/unity) escalates via Kael's agency—his deduction and proposal tighten options. Cost is visible: committing reserves and risking exposure. The tension between caution and trust is resolved with a meaningful turn that forecloses isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mutual aid emerges organically from actions and images—donations as silent dialogue, bell as chosen community. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and exchange.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited to Kael is stable; perceptual signature is distinct (noticing knots, honey). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (Miren's shift). Voice is consistently lyrical yet controlled, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with varied rhythm and high information density. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. Sentences accelerate and breathe with scene needs; closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-crisis resilience through mutual aid; specific details (dockworker knot, terra-cotta arbor) ground familiar premise. The bell's transformation from loss to choice feels inevitable. Not radically innovative but executed with integrity.</comment>
