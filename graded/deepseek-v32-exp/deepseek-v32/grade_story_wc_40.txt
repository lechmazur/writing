<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's reticence and scholarly nature are consistently portrayed, with interiority shown through concrete actions and micro-choices (e.g., aligning the crystal, documenting discoveries). His arc from solitude to sharing is earned, though a slight tell in "his reticence giving way to a need to share" prevents a higher score. The final choice to testify is motivated by prior causality and carries visible cost in his transformed role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly: sonic discoveries build to a charged testimony. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the "murmur of awe" and Elias's found voice. Orientation is immediate; pattern taught early and paid off at closure without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Library and dawn setting are vividly filtered through Elias's perception, with selective sensory detail (crystals like frozen tears, thick carpets). The crystal as micro-setting constrains choice and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear, and atmosphere deepens stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding growth) escalates through Elias's agency—aligning crystal, discovering signatures, preparing testimony. One meaningful tightening: the testimony forces a trade-off (his reticence) with cost felt in the broken hush. Pressure coheres under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of growth beyond language emerges organically from particulars (sonic signatures, fractured sequences). Subtext operates through imagery (crystal, hush). Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; weathered innocence reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV third-person limited is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature (scholarly, attentive to sound and silence). Prose rhythm modulates with pressure; purposeful compression (fractured sequences) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical but controlled prose with varied sentence rhythm and high information density. Minor overwriting risk ("frozen tears") but no loops or artifacts that dull closure. Figurative language is consistent and supports atmosphere. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific: sonic decoding in a post-linguistic world. Synthesis of elements (crystal, library, fractured sequences) feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure remains legible.</comment>
