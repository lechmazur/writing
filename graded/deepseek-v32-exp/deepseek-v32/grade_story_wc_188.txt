<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, with micro-choices under pressure (adjusting plan based on ambient awareness). However, interiority lacks contradictory impulses, and the emotional arc is one-note determination without internal conflict, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate; closure lands with felt cost (temporary defiance of despair) and is shaped by the persistent constraint of the mosaic note. The plot is elegantly simple and cause-effect driven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral: the mosaic note constrains timing, the fortress responds to the fireworks, and sensory details (petals of light, hushed night) charge atmosphere and closure. The environment actively shapes choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defying hopelessness) is signaled early and escalates through Kael's agency; cost (ephemeral victory) is legible on the page. Pressure coheres and tightens as he prepares and launches the spectacle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of art as temporary defiance emerges organically through action and image (fireworks as replacement stars). Subtext in the mosaic note and chanting enriches without moralizing. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and filtered through Kael's artistic perception; voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (professional awareness of skies and crowds). No head-hopping or distance issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, rhythmic, and dense without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("gravity of hopelessness") is purposeful and clear. Sentences advance story and atmosphere with varied syntax and strong verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fireworks designer as hope-bringer, with original touches (mosaic note, ambient awareness). Execution feels inevitable and specific, avoiding cliché. Risk-taking in lyric tone heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
