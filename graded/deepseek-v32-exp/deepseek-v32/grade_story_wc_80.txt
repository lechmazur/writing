<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied; his motivation evolves from recording to witnessing with earned change, visible in his stoic facade fissuring upon finding the locket, and final choice carries cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a conceptual repricing with cost legible in the final image of interment; orientation is clear early, and the pavilion's constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is integral, constraining access and charging the final image; sensory details like "mossy dome" are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elias's agency; discovery of the locket deepens conflict from recording to witnessing, with cost felt in his emotional shift and final act of interment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of interment vs. excavation emerges organically; subtext in imagery and action, with a resonant, non-literal answer in the final realization, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical yet controlled, reflecting Elias's stoic sensitivity, and no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density; no loops or scaffold; figurative language like "silent conflagration" is consistent and enhances clarity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and specific; synthesis of archaeologist and dreamer feels inevitable, with risk-taking in quiet reflection and transformation of tropes through lived detail.</comment>
