<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's silent, persistent nature is consistently embodied through concrete action and perception. Her motivation to interpret silence as possibility drives key choices, culminating in an earned realization that silence is a space for creation. The final commitment to stay and mend feels organic, though the internal contradiction and visible cost are subtle, limiting the score from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—the abandoned train transforms into a cradle of potential through Elara's actions. The accumulative lens holds, building texture toward a moment of conceptual repricing where silence is reweighted as creative space. Orientation is immediate and clear; cost is legible in the labor and commitment, though felt rather than explicit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospherically charged, from the whispering canyon to the gutted dining car oasis. The halo fragment and circus train constrain choice and directly charge the final image of restoration. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's artisan perspective. The score is capped due to the Q2 gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes center on Elara's search for forgotten beauty and her need to make the halo fragment sing. Escalation under the accumulative lens occurs through density increases—the discovery, the silent singing, the repair—each tightening her commitment. Agency is clear, and cost is legible in her focused labor and decision to stay, though the pressure remains quiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: silence as possibility, mending as a form of song. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—“to sing was sometimes to mend without a sound”—that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext is rich in gesture and implication. Score capped due to Q2 gate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct lyrical voice that reflects Elara's perceptual signature—noticing through wood grain, painted smiles, and quiet possibility. Rhythmic control is strong, and purposeful compression (e.g., "inside the chime of wind bells") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language ("whispering gleam") is consistent and purposeful, without muddle or scaffolding. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. The line-level craft supports momentum and closure. Score capped due to Q2 gate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of silent artisan, abandoned circus, and halo fragment feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in the quiet, lyrical approach heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded detail and emotional truth. Score capped due to Q2 gate.</comment>
