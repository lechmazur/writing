<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael’s dual allegiance is concretely embodied through micro-choices (graffiti, committee work) and the chip as tactile anchor. Interior conflict feels simultaneous, and his final hopeful endurance is earned by prior causality, though the cost is more conceptual than viscerally personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a charged poise (eve of negotiations with defiant music) that reconfigures options with felt cost—the raft will change but the spirit may endure. Time pressure and the graffiti network create a meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The raft city and carnival are vivid, sensory, and pressure choices; the foundation stone chip recurs to charge the final image. Setting is fully integrated, constraining tactics and shaping the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving culture amid privatization) escalate through Kael’s agency—organizing the meeting, redistributing spaces—culminating in a united front. Cost is legible in the adaptation and hopeful desperation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of navigating change emerges through particulars (chip, graffiti, carnival music) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: spirit can endure through shared intention, not just physical preservation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a perceptive, orderly intuitive filter. Voice is consistent and slightly poetic, though not strikingly distinctive under peak pressure. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but functional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and generally clean, but minor clichés (“heart a drum of dual beats”) and a telling phrase (“hopeful desperation”) slightly dampen the line-level precision. No major artifacts or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of raft city, encoded graffiti, and dual allegiance feels organic and specific. The concept of navigating gentrification rather than outright resistance offers a non-obvious angle, though execution is more assured than groundbreaking.</comment>
