<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian and Kael are characterized with consistent, embodied traits; Kael's growth from skepticism to breakthrough is earned, and the final reclamation of memory carries visible cost through combative tenderness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate, closure is a decisive change with cost legible in Kael's declaration and the requirement to reclaim memory without bitterness; the tea-leaf method persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constraining—the library, shard-mirrors, and tea leaves directly pressure choices and charge the final image of the transformed swing, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reversing exile) escalates through Kael's agency; his breakthrough narrows options and forces a costly confrontation with memory, driven by causal linkages under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of resilience through understanding emerges organically from concrete images (shadow, swing, tea leaves); the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Poetic, consistent narrative voice with controlled focalization; perceptual signature is distinct in the attention to geometry and hush, and dialogue is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with no loops or scaffold; figurative language like "combative tenderness" is purposeful and clear, sustaining momentum through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of shard-mirrors, tea-leaf geometry, and reversible exile; the concept feels inevitable and transforms familiar tropes through specific, risk-taking detail.</comment>
