<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and drives the plot; interiority shows contradictory emotions of exhilaration and loss, embodied in precise actions. The final choice to initiate is earned, with visible cost in hollow triumph.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal chain from desire to action to unraveling is tight; closure lands with decisive change in lighthouse beam and Elian's perception, cost legible on page in "quiet, hollow triumph" and altered rhythm.</comment>
