<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Alaric's motivation is clear and intensifies through embodied perception; micro-choices under pressure earn his final acceptance with legible cost in the gear becoming part of his grasp.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing as Alaric integrates with the forest; the Accumulative lens holds with cost in the final image; translocation and gear shape tactics throughout without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The mechanical rainforest is vividly specific and constrains choices via wind sounds and gear; sensory details are purposeful and charge the final image indispensably.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of self-discovery escalates through density of insight; agency in listening and placing the gear leads to a legible cost of integration under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of mind-world integration emerges organically from images and actions; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; lyrical voice controls rhythm under pressure; elision in sleep transitions is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no artifacts obscure clarity; figurative language is consistent and supports pressure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mechanical rainforest concept is fresh and synthesized with character journey; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
