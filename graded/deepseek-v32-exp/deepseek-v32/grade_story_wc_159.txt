<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Arlen's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot, but interior contradiction and genuine struggle are absent; his competence and systematic approach are one-note, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (victory tempered by silence) and cost is legible; causal lens holds with clear orientation and a meaningful tightening from clue to song.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with the bamboo tube constraining choice and charging the final image; however, Q2's score below 8.8 caps this category at 8.7.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving the library) escalates through Arlen's agency; cost is felt in the ending's reminder of silence, though escalation is straightforward without major reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of preservation and loss emerges organically from particulars; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer, but Q2 cap limits the score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV with a distinct, poetic perceptual signature and consistent rhythmic control; no dialogue, but voice is cohesive. Capped due to Q2.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density, varied rhythm, and no scaffold or figurative muddle; closure image remains clear. Capped due to Q2.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise is original and synthesis feels inevitable; poetic risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Capped due to Q2.</comment>
