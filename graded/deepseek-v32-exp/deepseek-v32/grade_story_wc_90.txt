<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's pacifism is embodied through gravitational emotion and shadow work; her internal conflict between rage and acceptance drives micro-choices, culminating in an earned peace that forecloses despair with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as the dimension unfolds gently; cost is legible in the fading shimmers and dissolved tear; accumulative lens holds tight from first memory to final stitch.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship breathes with her emotional gravity; photographs and the tear act as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image with tangible specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through sequential confrontation of shadows; agency is unwavering as each stitch narrows options toward the key, with cost paid in released sorrow and gravitational release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from the transformation of grief into an invitation; subtext in tears and light avoids moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV voice maintains a ghostly, lyrical filter; perceptual signature is distinct, with rhythm modulating from resolve to peace without head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shadow work, gravitational emotion, and last-human archetype feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in lyrical accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
