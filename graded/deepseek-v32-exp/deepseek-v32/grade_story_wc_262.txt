<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in trait, but interiority lacks contradiction; emotional progression is smooth without genuine struggle, though micro-choices align with motives.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the final image ("hushed thunder faded to a whisper"). Orientation clear early, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting vividly constrains choice (booth as crucible) and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, woven through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through deepening impressions under accumulative lens; agency in attention and incubation, with cost visible in internal change and acknowledgment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images and motifs; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 <9.0, though quick test satisfied.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct perceptual signature; lyrical prose is consistent and voice-motivated, though some density borders on overwriting without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control; figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off. Minor artifacts not touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of concepts with specific details; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 <9.0, though integration is strong.</comment>
