<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear motivation and embodied emotion from synesthesia and past trauma; interiority is concrete but lacks contradictory impulses in scene, limiting peak complexity. Final choice earned with visible cost when she flinches.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with charged poise under an accumulative-textural lens; orientation is immediate and causality tight from goal to imprint. Cost is legible in her flinch and the forge's silent aftermath.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (aurora, brine, kelp) filtered through POV; the ashen forge and sunken greenhouse constrain choice and charge the final image of renewal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake escalates via protagonist's agency in collecting absences and imprinting; cost is unmistakable in her recognition of the devastating chime, foreclosing easy resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory, absence, and healing emerges through concrete images and silences; ending offers a non-literal answer with hard-won hope, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature from synesthesia; lyrical rhythm and selective attention to colors and absences heighten pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with propulsive, varied sentences; no loops or figurative muddle. Figurative language ("violet for sorrow") serves clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of synesthesia, memory imprinting, and ecological marvel; specific details feel inevitable, and risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
