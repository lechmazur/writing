<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is consistent and driven by her trait of wilting near dishonesty, which compels her quest for truth. Interiority is embodied through physical reactions like shaking hands and easing with candor. Her final choice to etch the truth is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in her wilting at the council's deceit. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her frailty from lies versus strength from honesty, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear causal chain from finding the map to discovering and spreading the truth. Closure is a decisive change with cost legible on-page: Elara wilts at dishonesty but lives in candor, and the city begins to heal. The drive lens (causal) holds without contradiction, and the persistent constraint of water rationing shapes tactics. Orientation is anchored early, and no causality breaks occur.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with toxic sky and glass domes, pressuring choices through water rationing and deceitful markets. The zinc plate fragment and map act as micro-settings that constrain Elara's path and charge the final image of truth-telling. Sensory details are selective and filtered through her POV, though some descriptions are brief. The environment meaningfully shapes tactics, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal quest to city-wide revelation, driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens. The discovery of the council's deceit forces a tightening of options, with cost unmistakable in her wilting and subsequent resolve. One meaningful turn—the revelation in the chamber—narrows her path to action. No coincidental resolutions; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of candor versus dishonesty emerges organically from Elara's actions and the city's decay, with subtext in gestures like wilting and sharing dreams. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through her calligraphy, though the line "candor in small moments could rebuild..." slightly moralizes. Still, theme integrates with character arc without heavy-handedness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; Elara's voice is lyrical and consistent, filtering the world through her profession and values. Minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as with the guard. Rhythm and syntax vary appropriately with pressure, and no head-hopping or distance issues occur.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and varied sentence rhythm, advancing story without scaffolds or loops. Figurative language ("like fossils in metal") is purposeful and clear, with no mixed metaphors or register drift. Artifact checks are clean; even peak beats maintain clarity and propulsion, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of greenhouse dystopia, calligraphic art, and physicalized candor feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific details like zinc plates and lost conversations. Risk-taking in linking emotional truth to environmental decay heightens stakes without gimmickry, offering a non-obvious angle on familiar material.</comment>
