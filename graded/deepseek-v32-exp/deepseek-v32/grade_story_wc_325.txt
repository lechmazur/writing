<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris's claustrophobia and personal motivation are clear and influence his choices, but the interiority occasionally leans toward summary (e.g., "he had become a keeper") rather than fully embodied contradiction under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight; orientation is immediate; closure lands with visible cost (blank codex, transformed fear) and the tidal constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and pressures choices (tidal window, claustrophobic corridors); the facility's state shift charges the final image, though some descriptions are slightly generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (standing by the unremembered) escalates via closing tidal window and tightening spaces; Aris's agency in activating the device carries a clear cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory and transformation emerges organically; final image of blank codex and transmitted stories resonates without moralizing, though the final paragraph edges toward statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and voice is consistently lyrical; occasional omniscient summary ("He would ensure...") slightly distances, but perceptual signature remains distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm; minor figurative repetition ("crashing hush") is pattern-taught and pays off at closure; no obstructive artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Synthesis of claustrophobia, phase transitions, and invisible tracking feels fresh and integrated; while not groundbreaking, the combination is specific and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
