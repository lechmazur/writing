<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Motivation is clear but interiority lacks contradiction or flaw; the summoner's persistence is straightforward without internal conflict. Embodied emotion is present but not deeply layered. Final choice feels task-oriented rather than earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration—silence achieved, prophecy hushed—under an accumulative lens. Orientation is immediate, cost is subtle but legible in the wing's dissolution. The structure is simple but coherent, though lacking persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail; the brook and origami wing function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Atmosphere supports the thematic tension between cosmic and earthly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early; escalation is driven by the summoner's will against the prophecy's resistance. Cost is visible but mild; the conflict is quiet and resolved through steady agency, fitting the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions—silence, order, flow—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the hushed brook and continued flow, inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a lyrical, focused perceptual signature. Voice is consistent and apt for the accumulative design; no dialogue but interiority is filtered through sensory attention without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished with varied rhythm and high information density; no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful, though occasionally leans purple without harming clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements synthesize into a fresh, atmospheric fantasy; the origami wing and mapping silence concept feel organic. Specificity anchors the premise, though emotional depth is secondary to texture, limiting risk-taking.</comment>
