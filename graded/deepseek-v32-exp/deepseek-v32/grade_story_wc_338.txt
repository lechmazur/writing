<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular ("shielded openness," methodical curiosity). The final renunciation (not documenting, accepting the tear) is a micro-choice under pressure that reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The choice is earned by the prior causal sequence of perception and realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held consistently. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of the chapel closing, a secret kept "in the confluence of earth, sky, and patient, empathetic listening," reconfigures the quest with undeniable conceptual cost. The map tear as sacred threshold is the persistent constraint that shapes the final image. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting (vault, henge, rain) is vividly sensory and filters through POV bias. It constrains choice (saturation, pressure, specific spot) and decisively charges the final image—the environment is the mechanism of revelation. The vault's physical properties are inextricable from the plot's escalation and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (perceiving the chapel) is signaled early. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is a decisive cadence shift: the protagonist's agency in turning off gear and listening with his bones triggers the revelation, reweighting the stake. Cost is legible in the renunciation of documentation and the acceptance of the void as the true map.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (the ineffable, mapping absence, empathetic silence) emerges organically from concrete particulars (torn map, shadow comparison, pressure change). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the chapel is a "secret kept not in stone"—that reweights the quest without moralizing. Subtext operates through image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV (first-person) is stable and apt. Voice has a distinct perceptual signature ("cartographer of lost intangibles," "shielded openness") and rhythmic control. The lyric, introspective register is consistent, voice-motivated, and modulates purposefully with the climactic shift to total sensory receptivity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and purposeful, with high information density ("a shadow not present fifty years ago. It is as if the stone itself is breathing"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates through the revelation and decelerates into the resonant closure. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartography, acoustic archaeology, and phenomenological listening feels fresh and non-obvious. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded detail and a commitment to its implications. Risk-taking (a plot built on comparing silent footage and perceiving pressure changes) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
