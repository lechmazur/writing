<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ero's motivation and interiority are concrete, but the character lacks internal contradiction, making him steadfast yet limited in depth. Final choice to harmonize the arrowhead is earned through prior causality, with cost in the effort of resonance-skimming.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure via resonant reconfiguration lands with conceptual cost in the arrowhead's harmonization and Ero's earned peace. Causality is clear, but cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral to action—the bone towers and canyon echoes constrain Ero's choices and charge the final image of restored harmony, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes of spiritual navigation escalate through Ero's agency; one meaningful tightening occurs as he syncs pulse with birds and bone. Cost is legible in the completion of harmony, though not a heavy forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of stillness containing every journey emerges organically from particulars; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is consistently poetic with a distinct perceptual signature tied to Ero's consciousness; POV is stable and purposefully compressed, supporting the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and artifact-free; figurative language serves clarity and momentum, with no loops or scaffold obscuring the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of a harmonic skimmer and a pulse-wandering arrowhead is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis; risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
