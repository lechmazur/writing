<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, philosophical craving. The poet's final choice is earned through the layered visions, and his "ethically playful" curiosity is demonstrated, not told. The embodied handling of the rope ("rough, familiar bite") and the internal weighing of scales show character under pressure. A slight lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the climax prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant Earned Stasis—the poet's choice to stay and translate, foreclosing transcendence with visible cost ("embracing the limitation"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with pressure escalating through layered visions that reweight the dominant stake. Orientation is immediate, and the final image (writing on the wall, rope as paperweight) reconfigured meaning with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The terra-cotta grotto is vividly rendered through specific, multi-sensory detail ("smelled of ancient dust," "whorled like a fossilized fingerprint") and functions as essential micro-setting, physically containing the visions that force the poet's choice. The frayed rope evolves from a relic to a charged object constraining the final image. Environment and object are indispensable to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transcendence vs. human chronicle—is signaled early and escalates cleanly under the Accumulative lens via the deepening visions. The poet's agency in making the final choice is clear, and the cost (renouncing full understanding of time) is legible on the page in the final paragraphs. The tightening is meaningful and forecloses a live option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the poet's quest and the rope's transformation, exploring choice, essence, and the grain of human experience. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of writing, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in the rope's shifting symbolism and the "ethically playful" calculus.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct poetic perceptual signature ("time felt different now, thicker, layered like sediment"). Diction and rhythm are controlled and heighten pressure, particularly in the climax. The voice modulates subtly from lyrical observation to charged introspection without losing coherence. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical, with high information density. However, a minor tendency toward stacked figurative language ("gritty as clay, smooth as starlight, frayed as hemp") in the peak beat creates a slight decorative flourish. No loops, scaffold, or clarity issues; momentum and rhythm remain strong, supporting the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a philosophical drifter, energy beings, and a terra-cotta grotto feels fresh and organic. The core concept of "texture of time" is transformed through specific, grounded choices, culminating in the poet's earned renunciation. The rope's reprise as a "paperweight" is a specific, non-obvious inflection that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
