<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's defiance and guilt are embodied through micro-choices; his apology is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the confrontation with Elara, showing contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration via apology and echoes, with cost legible in Elara's tear and the "forever changed" silence; orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting of bone towers and echoes constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and woven through action, directly enabling the refraction method.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Kaelen's agency from poetry sessions to confrontation; apology tightens options with cost felt in the echo-transformed silence and emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness and refractive truth emerges through particulars; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via echoes without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled, and dialogue (when present) carries subtext without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with no loops or scaffolds; figurative language is consistent and clarity is maintained even in peak beats like the apology echo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of rebellion, echoes, and forgiveness feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical language and conceptual integration heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
