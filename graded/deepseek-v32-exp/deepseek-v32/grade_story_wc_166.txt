<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is vivid and drives the narrative; her interiority is conveyed through embodied dance, though internal conflict is minimal, which fits her steadfast character arc and does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost (speck falls, transformation); accumulative lens holds tightly, with the moonstone speck as a persistent constraint that personalizes the sky chart.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is richly specific and integral; the garden and stars charge the closure, and the moonstone speck as object-as-setting constrains Elara's dance, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are personal and cosmic; escalation under accumulative lens is driven by Elara's agency with the moonstone catalyst, and cost is unmistakable in the final transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of art and exile emerges through concrete particulars; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is consistently poetic and filtered through Elara's distinct perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure supports the accumulative texture without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is flawless with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or figurative muddle, and closure is propelled with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is original and fully committed; synthesis of dance, exile, and cosmic inscription feels organic and inevitable, with risk-taking in poetic style heightening stakes.</comment>
