<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, but lacks contradictory impulses in scene, limiting peak emotional complexity. Final realization is earned through causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with logical linkages; orientation is immediate; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with legible cost in the slow change against entrenched lies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory detail filtered through POV; the orchard and diamond actively constrain choices and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (excavating truth) escalates through protagonist agency under causal lens; cost is visible in the effort and the burden of revealing truth to complacent survivors.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from actions and images; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though occasional explicit phrasing slightly reduces subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature aligned to Kael's sharp observation; voice is consistent but rhythmic control under pressure is competent rather than exceptional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with good information density; minor scaffold artifacts (repetitive sentence stems) appear but do not obscure causality or dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Combines familiar tropes with fresh, grounded specifics (diamond as geological key, stillpoint as balance); synthesis feels inevitable, though not highly risk-taking.</comment>
