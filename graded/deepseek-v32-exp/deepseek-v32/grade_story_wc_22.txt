<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies, interiority concrete, and final choice to sacrifice all seeds is earned with visible cost. Lacks strong internal contradiction, but micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a decisive change with felt cost (using all seed pods, garden expansion). Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from bird agitation to concord discovery to ritual. Orientation anchored immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail filtered through POV; jetty and submerged concord constrain choices and charge the final image. "Narrow vastness" tone coherently pressures the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming battlefield) signaled early; escalation driven by protagonist agency via bird interpretation and concord discovery. Cost legible in emptying seed pods and the resulting vast reclamation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of covenant and renewal emerges through particulars (seed pods, dead languages, concord) without moralizing. Ending offers resonant non-literal answer via the garden's remembered expansion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature; lyrical, poetic voice controls rhythm under pressure. No head-hopping; purposeful compression supports closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density, varied rhythm, and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with no muddle in peak beats like the ritual scattering.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Organic synthesis of elements (coachman, seed pods, dead languages, bird calls, submerged concord) feels inevitable; specific, mythic angle on post-apocalyptic renewal heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
