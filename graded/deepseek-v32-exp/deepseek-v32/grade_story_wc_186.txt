<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias’s motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, driving his choices under pressure. Interiority is concrete and embodied, though contradictory impulses are more sequential than simultaneous in scene. The final choice to rekindle the beacon is earned by prior causality with visible cost. A hairline deduction for not fully enacting contradictory impulses within a single beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate and closure lands with decisive change and conceptual repricing. The cost—years of effort yielding a redefined beacon—is legible in the final image. The broken prism as a persistent constraint shapes tactics throughout. No causality breaks; the ending reweights meaning without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly selective and purpose-driven, with the glass pavilion and broken prism constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail reflects POV urgency and professional bias. The environment evolves causally with the action, becoming integral to the climax. Micro-setting (prism) functions as a key tool that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving coincidences have meaning) is signaled early and tightens through protagonist agency under the causal lens. Escalation is driven by Elias’s retrocognitive vision and alignment decision, culminating in a cost legible on the page. The final beam redefines options with a felt trade-off. No coincidence resolves the conflict; it complicates productively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—the broken prism, the shard of hush, the rekindled beam—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of meaning, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates through image and implication. No abstract statements; the final image carries conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Elias’s perceptual signature. Voice is distinct with controlled rhythm, though a slight ornamental tinge in phrases like “thistle-blown hope” moderates the score. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful. Diction remains within character lexicon even under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats. Sentence-level rhythm supports scene needs. Information density is high, with each line advancing story, character, or atmosphere. No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic custodian, retrocognition, and celestial mechanics feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. The final reconfiguration—a beacon that signals meaning rather than guides ships—is earned and bold. Authenticity of vision is strong.</comment>
