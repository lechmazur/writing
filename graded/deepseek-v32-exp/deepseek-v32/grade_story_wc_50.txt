<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and drives the narrative, with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure. However, the characterization leans abstract, lacking deep internal contradiction or embodied emotion in peak beats, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens held cleanly; orientation is immediate. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with legible cost—the season's passage and labor—and the persistent constraint of the cavern's light patterns shapes tactics. A hairline lack of visceral punch prevents a 9+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The marble cavern is vividly specific, constraining choice via reflection angles and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, fully integrated with action. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 not reaching 9.0 gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (storing wonder) are signaled early; escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Elian's agency through study and reverse-engineering. Cost is legible in time and effort, though the pressure remains intellectual rather than viscerally urgent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars—light, echoes, the cellar of reason—and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 gate, though integration is seamless.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature: reflective, precise, and peripherally focused. Voice modulates with the accumulative pattern, and syntax reflects Elian's observant mind. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and controlled figurative language. No loops or scaffold obscuring closure. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 gate, though line-level craft is very strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of locksmith, echoes, timer, and cavern feels fresh and inevitable, committed fully to its premise. Specific detail and emotional truth elevate it. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 gate, but originality is high.</comment>
