<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her father's history; her interior contradiction (rejecting cold calculus while seeking meaning) acts in scene. The final choice to return and share the lantern is earned by her journey, with cost legible in the father's admission and her realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; each cryptic scrawl adds density toward a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the garden. Closure lands on-page with cost ("I always saw the odds, never the stakes") and the pattern is taught early by the first scrawl.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and selective (wet stone, rain-streaked windows). The lantern object constrains choice (lit in the park) and decisively charges the final image, projecting etchings onto the father's hands.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens: each interpreted scrawl deepens the thematic stake. Cost is unmistakable in the final exchange, where the father's regret and Elara's new perspective reconfigure the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (lantern, scrawls, rain). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"a new probability" as a promise—without moralizing, reweighting prior material through image and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is consistent (mathematical melancholy). No head-hopping; elision (cryptic scrawls) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative build, and the final image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of probability, cryptic graffiti, and a mathematical lantern feels inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the emotional truth is specific and grounded.</comment>
