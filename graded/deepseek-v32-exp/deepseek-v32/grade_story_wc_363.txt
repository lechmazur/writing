<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Althea's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; her sacrifice is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., "stoically sparkling with unshed tears." The final choice to spin her life-line feels inevitable and reconfigures the stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with felt cost (Althea's disappearance) under a causal lens that holds tightly. Orientation is immediate; the raveling silence acts as a persistent constraint shaping tactics. The ending delivers a decisive change with resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through POV, with the orchard and Loom constraining choices. The amber bead as micro-setting charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, e.g., "perpetual twilight," reinforcing tone and stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: the Loom's resistance forces Althea's sacrifice, narrowing options with unmistakable cost. Dominant stake (message delivery) tightens credibly; the raveling silence provides coherent pressure under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of love and sacrifice emerges through particulars like the amber bead and jigsaw shards, not statement. The ending offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct poetic signature. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and purposeful compression (e.g., "hush of time's unraveling tapestry") is taught and legible. No head-hopping; perceptual bias is character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with varied rhythm and high information density. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language coheres and supports closure. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the sacrifice beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of loom weaving, temporal repair, and sacrifice feels inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific details (jigsaw edges, amber bead). Risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
