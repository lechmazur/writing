<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Keeper’s interior contradiction (duty vs. homesickness) is embodied in concrete choices; her final act of wearing the pendant is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the garden’s transformation. The emotional progression avoids diagnostic label-speak, and her “wait” reconfigures into an active, open-ended stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with felt cost in the pendant’s weight and the softened light boundaries. Orientation is immediate, and the pendant’s intrusion provides a meaningful tightening that drives the single decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The frozen garden and its stark light boundaries function as micro-setting that constrains Keeper’s movement and charges the final image when they blur. Sensory details are selective, filtered through her archival perception, and evolve causally with the pendant’s influence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (homesickness vs. duty) escalates through the pendant’s arrival, forcing Keeper’s agency in interiorizing it. Under the accumulative lens, a single decisive intensification—her choice to wear the pendant—reweights options with clear cost in the garden’s transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (making friends with uncertainty) emerges through concrete particulars—the pendant, the light boundaries—and resolves in a non-literal, resonant image: “guardian of the frozen, living text.” No moralizing; the final reconfiguration offers a complex, earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature (library-archive lexicon) and rhythmic control. The voice—poetic, precise—modulates with pressure and supports the accumulative design without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density; figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, accelerating and breathing with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of guardian, frozen archive, and dimensional homesickness feels organic and inevitable. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting; risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
