<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Leo's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and earned change; his quietly analytic nature drives micro-choices under pressure, and the final understanding of letting go is causally earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early; causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages from discoveries to realization; closure is a Conceptual Repricing with legible cost in "heart heavy with understanding but light with release."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sunken ship library constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Leo's POV, with objects like the snow globe and log integral to the narrative pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding letting go) escalates through Leo's agency as he untangles clues; one meaningful tightening occurs with the note's equation, and cost is felt in the sophisticated melancholy and release at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars like the snow globe and transmissions; subtext operates through image and implication, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is consistently analytic yet poetic, and rhythmic control supports pressure without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, maintaining clarity through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of deep-sea exploration with philosophical inquiry; specific details like the sunken ship library and snow globe transform tropes through character-driven stakes, with risk-taking in quiet introspection.</comment>
