<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas is vividly drawn with specific traits and a clear motivation that intensifies under pressure. His final shift from collector to recalibrator is earned by the discoveries, though internal contradiction is minimal, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The accumulative structure builds through sensory details and discoveries to a resonant Conceptual Repricing. Closure lands with cost as the quiet now holds the "pattern of a dragon's wing," reorienting the premise, and the inferred lens holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The silo library is a palpable, charged environment that constrains choice and supplies the key objects. The tapestry's discovery and placement on the central column directly shape the final image, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from collecting stories to recalibrating humanity's lost axis through Silas's active probing and interpretation. The cost of a world unmoored from wonder is legible in the final, charged quiet, driven by agency under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the diaries, tapestry, and Silas's realization, culminating in a non-literal answer—the dragon's wing pattern as a start—without moralizing, and reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV maintains a distinct, poetic perceptual signature aligned with Silas's sensitivity. The voice is consistent and heightens the textural accumulation, with no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("bronze quiet," "curled like dying leaves") is purposeful and clear, propelling the narrative with high information density and no muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of a historian collecting wall-stories in a post-dream world is fresh, and the synthesis of silo, tapestry, and axis displacement feels inevitable and specific, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
