<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Aris's interiority is concrete and character-specific, with grief depicted as a "tight polymer chain" loosening into something pliable. His micro-choices (scattering some ashes, keeping some) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final transformation—from monument to medium—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied through professional metaphor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is clear and held. Orientation is immediate and functional. Closure is a resonant Conceptual Repricing: love becomes a "growing point," reweighting prior material with undeniable cost felt in the final peace. The braided pattern taught early pays off cleanly at the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The braided ravine functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice (where he sits, observes, scatters ashes) and decisively charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through a chemist's POV. The environment is inseparable from the thematic synthesis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a deepening insight that reweights the dominant stake (translating separation to connection). Agency is clear in the decision to scatter ashes and conceive the polymer project. Cost is legible on-page in the partial scattering and the reconfiguration of grief into purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of polymer chemistry and metamorphosis, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the synthesis of memory and purpose. The final image ("a growing point") reweights all prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature—the world is filtered through a symphonically-minded chemist's lens. Voice is consistent and purposeful, blending scientific precision with lyrical observation. No head-hopping; elision and compression are taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with no mixed metaphors or loops. Sentences advance character and theme simultaneously. No artifacts obscure causality or dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of specialized vocation (polymer chemistry), grief, and ecological restoration feels inevitable and non-obvious. The core concept is fully committed to and followed through with specific, grounded detail. Risk-taking with technical lexicon heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
