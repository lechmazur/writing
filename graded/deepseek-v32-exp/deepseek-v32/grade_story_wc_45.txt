<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction (skepticism vs. yearning) acts in scene, and her final choice to use the tooth for healing is earned by the cleft in certainty, with visible cost in the tooth's dissolution. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are consistently character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds; closure lands with felt cost as the tooth dissolves into a constellation, reconfiguring grief into peace. Orientation is anchored early, and the three-shard mosaic (garden–village–garden) maintains legible transitions and coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The secret garden and changeling’s tooth function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Elara’s professional bias, woven into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (healing grief) escalates through Elara’s agency: finding the tooth forces a cleft in certainty, leading to the ritual. Cost is legible in the tooth’s dissolution and the family’s release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete actions and images—the tooth, the constellation—offering a resonant, non-literal answer about accepting mysteries. No moralizing; subtext operates through gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (bone setter’s precision blended with lyrical wonder). Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated. Peak beats remain clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of changeling myth into a healing narrative; the constellation as memorial feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of character and setting transforms the trope without gimmickry.</comment>
