<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, but interior contradiction is minimal; the Keeper's observational stance yields little struggle, and the final endurance feels inherent rather than earned through on-page pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the acceptance of decay. Orientation is clear early, and transitions between library and hut are legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral to atmosphere; the library and obsidian hut function as micro-settings that charge the final image, though they constrain choice only indirectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes (regenerative silence) are signaled early and deepen via accumulative density; agency lies in the Keeper's attentional choices, but escalation is gentle and cost is subtle rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete images (decay, silence, folding) and avoids moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the Keeper's cyclical acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct; voice is poetic and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature. No dialogue, but lyric compression is taught and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied rhythm; no evident loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and cohesive, though occasionally risks overwriting without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of contemplative fantasy elements; the origami swan and regenerative silence feel organic and specific, transforming familiar tropes through grounded, poetic detail.</comment>
