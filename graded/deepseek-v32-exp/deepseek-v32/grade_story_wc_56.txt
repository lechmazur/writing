<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses and emotional complexity. Competence is shown through micro-choices, yet the characterization remains single-note without flaws or internal conflict, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly; orientation is immediate. Closure lands with a decisive change in knowledge—the city erased by lies—and cost is legible in the revealed documents. The sundial persistently shapes tactics, earning the turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and integral, with the twilight canal and sundial constraining choice and charging the final image. Details are filtered through Elara's perception and woven into action, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth) escalates through Elara's agency in salvaging the box, tightening options. Cost is legible in the revelation of deliberate lies, and the resolution is earned by her actions under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus lies emerges organically from the salvage and the sundial's symbolism. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer, though the final statement edges toward directness, slightly reducing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a lyrical, perceptually selective texture. No head-hopping; prose rhythm supports the contemplative tone. Dialogue is absent, not required.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished with varied syntax and strong information density. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is controlled. Minor abstract phrases ("serene upheaval") do not obscure clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The combination of legend-seeking, twilight navigation, and a truth-compass sundial feels organic and specific. While not groundbreaking, the synthesis is fresh and executed with coherence, though it leans on familiar archetypes.</comment>
