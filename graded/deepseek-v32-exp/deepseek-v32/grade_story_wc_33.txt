<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ezra's motivation is clear and character-particular, driving his micro-choices under pressure. His final act—tapping the coded signal—is a credible endurance/renunciation earned by prior causality (linking absences, Kael's disappearance). Interiority is concrete ("heart hammered, but his posture remained that of a weary civil servant"), though the closing line's abstract "something began, quietly, to heal" slightly distances the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: Ezra's routine is interrupted by inspection, his diversion sends the data, and closure is a Charged Poise ("The brittle hush held, but beneath it, something began, quietly, to heal"). Cost is legible in the seized bottle and Kael's absence, though the final healing is slightly more told than shown. Orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cobalt arcade is a vivid, pressure-filled environment that constrains choice (the sanctioned mail drop, the patrol drones). The "thunderstorm in a bottle" functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, though some phrases ("neon-drenched no-man's-land") lean on familiar genre texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (smuggling data to foster contact) escalates cleanly under the causal lens via Vynn's inspection, forcing Ezra's risky diversion. Agency drives the turn; cost is legible in the loss of the physical device. One meaningful tightening is sufficient, and the price (the bottle seized, the signal sent) alters the tactical outcome.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of broken promises and quiet healing emerges organically from events and images (the sealed shop, the transmitted signal, the final hush). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (the coded tap, the green light) and the repurposed "brittle hush."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and effective, with a distinct perceptual signature (weary, observant, lyrical). Voice modulates under pressure ("The brittle hush tightened, ready to shatter"). Diction occasionally drifts slightly elevated ("contained fury") but remains largely within character. No head-hopping or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean and purposeful with good rhythmic control. Minor artifacts: a slight synonym churn ("brittle hush" repeated, "swirling miniature storm") and a trace of overwriting in peak beats ("vibrating with a contained fury"). These do not obscure causality or dull the closure image. Information density is high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—a mailman smuggling data via drone in a neon arcade, using "linking absences" as method—feels fresh and specific. The "thunderstorm in a bottle" is a memorable, irreplaceable object. Tropes are transformed through grounded character choices and a quiet, charged closure that takes a meaningful risk.</comment>
