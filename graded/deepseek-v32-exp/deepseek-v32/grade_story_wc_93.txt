<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's internal conflict between harnessing and connection is embodied in micro-choices; his final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the release of star dust.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in the dissipation of star dust and Kael's smile, shaped by his persistent curse.</comment>
