<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through micro-choices; Leo's transformation is earned through her adaptive, non-forceful approach. Minor diagnostic label ("withdrawn boy") slightly tempers the otherwise specific interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens held; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the fragile connection. Orientation is immediate, and the eclipse pattern teaches the lyric structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory details are selective and purposeful; the eclipse environment charges the final image. The ridge and changing light are integral to the moment of awe, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (nurturing wonder) escalate through the eclipse's awe, driven by Elara's adaptive agency. Cost is legible in her "cautious exuberance" and Leo's fragile response.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of ordinary magic emerges through concrete events and images; subtext operates in gesture and silence. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited; lyrical voice is consistent and distinct, with perceptual signature filtered through Elara's consciousness. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with varied rhythm and high information density; no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language ("silent, starry hole") is purposeful and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar elements (therapist/child, eclipse) through specific, grounded detail and emotional specificity. Lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
