His motivation intensifies through the arduous process, and the final community revival is earned by prior causality with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions are dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with clear orientation within 120 words.

The amber bottle as a persistent constraint shapes tactics, and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and selective, with the cove and bottle constraining choices and charging the final image.

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of genuine growth versus false comfort emerges through particulars, with subtext in the bottle as record.
