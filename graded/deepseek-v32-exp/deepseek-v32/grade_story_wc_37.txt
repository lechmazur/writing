<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied, but the absence of internal contradictory impulses prevents the highest band. Her change from scattered to whole is earned through causal actions with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early, causal lens holds tightly, and closure lands with a decisive change—the realm reborn—with conceptual cost in the prior decay and collective effort.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The alchemical greenhouse and mica window are not just vivid backdrops; they constrain Elara's choices and directly charge the final image of woven dawns, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Elara's agency as she shifts from solitary humming to gathering a chorus, tightening pressure with the cost of communal unity legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unity through memory and song emerges organically from concrete actions, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and lyrical, with a distinct perceptual signature in Elara's fragmented consciousness, and rhythmic control supports pressure throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with varied rhythm and high information density; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle obscure the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of mirror world, alchemical flora, and communal song feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical abstraction that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
