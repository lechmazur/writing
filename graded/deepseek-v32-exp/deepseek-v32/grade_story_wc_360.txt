<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear and drives the plot; his fragmentation from borrowed personalities is embodied and culminates in an earned renunciation. Some abstract labeling ("geometric patterns of pain") slightly distances, but his final choice carries visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: experiments lead to overload, halo shatters, and Aris changes. Closure lands with legible cost (scarred but wiser, new constellation). Orientation is immediate, lens holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The topaz workshop and vanishing stars are integral atmosphere; the halo fragment constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and mirrors internal states without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (quest vs. self) escalate through Aris's agency—each borrowing fragments him until the anonymous letter causes crisis. Cost is unmistakable in the shattering and collapse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through transposition and fragmentation, but the final paragraph states the moral somewhat explicitly ("not to be mastered but appreciated"). The closing image (new constellation) offers resonant non‑literal balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; voice is distinct and consistently poetic ("lucid turbulence," "cryptic operator"). No head‑hopping; rhythmic control supports pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, rhythm varies, and information density is high. No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and fully committed—letterpress empathy, halo fragment, vanishing stars synthesize into an inevitable arc. Risk‑taking in poetic prose heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
