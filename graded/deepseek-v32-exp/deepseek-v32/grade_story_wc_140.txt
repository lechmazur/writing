<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in sensory filtering; interiority is concrete. The final realization about the poison is earned through accumulated fragments. Minor deduction for limited on-page micro-choices under immediate pressure—action is largely observational until the crystallization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens held firmly. Orientation is immediate and vivid. Closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing: the poison label and layered stories crystallize into a "sharp, painful shard of truth" with clear, felt cost on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is a brilliantly rendered, constraining environment that functions as both setting and central metaphor, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and deeply filtered through the POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (discovering memory's texture) escalate cleanly under the accumulative lens: the label discovery and the watchman's story deepen pressure, leading to a crystallization that narrows understanding with a legible cost ("terrifying, beautiful softness").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of erased identity emerges organically through the layering of specific sensations and artifacts. The final paragraph offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the "texture" of identity—without moralizing, born from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinctive, characterized by a perceptual signature that "filters reality differently." The prose rhythm is controlled and voice-consistent, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is integrated and purposeful ("metallic symphony"). One minor moment of slightly elevated diction ("spectral figure") is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh, organic synthesis of the amnesia trope through the conceits of bureaucratic error and sensory archaeology. The container-labyrinth-as-mind metaphor is specific and fully committed, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
