<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marta's interiority is concrete and contradictory impulses act in scene (carving to contain, not to forget). Her final choice to continue carving is earned by prior causality with visible cost: the acceptance of absence and the effort to transform grief into a tangible container.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with clear cost on the page: the carving becomes a "lid for a void." The accumulative lens holds, and the persistent constraint of the kettle's timeframe shapes tactics. Orientation is immediate and pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The rain-beaded loft and the ash wood blank function as micro-setting and recurring object that constrain choice (kettle as clock, carving as action) and charge the final image (fractured silver light, scent of ash). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (processing grief) escalates under the accumulative lens via density increase and cadence shift (kettle's whistle). Protagonist agency drives deepening; cost is legible in the final image of the carving as a tool for living with absence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars (carving, memories, kettle) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: grief is not ended but held in a "structure sturdy enough to hold it." Subtext operates through image and action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (lyrical, introspective). Voice modulates with emotional intensity; diction and rhythm are controlled under pressure. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (memories) is anchored and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and clear with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates and breathes with scene needs; closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar grief narrative through specific, irreplaceable details (lion tamer, crystallized time, carving as alchemy). Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
