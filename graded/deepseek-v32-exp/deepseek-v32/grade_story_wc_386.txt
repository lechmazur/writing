<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and drives the plot, but internal conflict is minimal and flaws are not deeply explored. Her compassion and professionalism are consistent, and her final action is earned by prior causality. The relationship with Linnea serves as a crucible, though Elara's characterization lacks contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with clear orientation and a decisive closure on-page. The cost is conceptual but legible in the final image of the snow globe and the spirit's peace. The plot is economical and coherent, though the method of truth-projection leans slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with the ice walls functioning as both atmosphere and plot device that enables the climax. The melted snow globe recurs with reweighted meaning, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, fully filtered through Elara's perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (salvaging pure truth) is signaled early and escalates through Elara's agency under the causal lens. The tightening occurs when she learns the truth and must act to expose it, but the conflict lacks intense pressure or personal cost for the protagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging truth and self-sacrifice emerges organically through concrete images and actions, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the snow globe and the projected truth, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is stable, lyrical, and distinct, with a consistent third-person limited POV. Elara's perceptual signature is clear, and the prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity. Dialogue is sparse but functional, and there is no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or scaffolding artifacts. Figurative language is effective and coherent, advancing atmosphere and plot. The closing image is sharp and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Concept is a fresh, organic synthesis of ghost-whispering, dream analysis, and glacial mystery. The combination feels inevitable in hindsight, and the twist about the captain's sacrifice is earned. Specificity in setting and object elevates the premise beyond template.</comment>
