<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Aris's frugality and devotion are consistent traits that compel his final sacrifice, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses and embodied emotion under pressure, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly; closure is a decisive change with clear on-page cost ("His consciousness unraveled..."); the tile's discovery and alignment drive a logically tight sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The palace as astrolabe and the magic square tile function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposefully woven.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Aris's agency under the causal lens, with a clear tightening at the alignment beat; cost is legible, though internal conflict is minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of ironic expenditure emerges organically from events and images; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer, though the irony is stated explicitly ("empirically ironic").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, celestial perceptual signature; no dialogue, but compression and rhythm are controlled throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; minor figurative stacking near the climax ("figures of fire") slightly edges toward purple but does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mathematical magic, historical fantasy, and ironic character arc feels inevitable; the frugality-to-sacrifice transformation is specific and fully committed.</comment>
