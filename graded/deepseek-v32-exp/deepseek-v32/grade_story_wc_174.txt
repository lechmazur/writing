<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's interior contradiction (serene exterior vs. internal tremor) and micro-choices under pressure are concrete; his final renunciation of performance is earned by prior causality with visible cost—the surrender of artistic control and pride.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a decisive change (abandoning puppets for raw confession) with felt cost on the page; the story stick acts as a persistent constraint that shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The radar dome and story stick are vividly specific; the stick, as a micro-setting object, constrains choice and charges the final image—its passing reconfigures the ritual and delivers closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ethical integrity) escalates via protagonist agency; his epiphany forces a true reversal of method, with cost legible in his public confession and relinquished control.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the woman’s raw story, avoiding moralizing while reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (urbane, reflective); voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping; elision (the argument) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmically controlled; zero loops or scaffold; figurative language ("meteor hush," "half-lit epiphanies") is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of calligraphy, puppet shows, and ancient ritual feels inevitable; risk-taking (quiet epiphany, method reversal) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
