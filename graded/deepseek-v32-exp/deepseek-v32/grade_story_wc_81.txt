<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete interiority shown through methodical actions under pressure. The final choice to add her stamp is earned by prior causality, though the lack of contradictory impulses within the scene prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant Conceptual Repricing ("origins are not points but processes") that carries conceptual cost. The Causal lens holds tightly via because/therefore linkages, and the blackout constraint meaningfully shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sunken library and antique ink stamp are vividly specific and pressure choices; the stamp in particular constrains action and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ test. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Elara’s professional perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (tracing honest origins) escalate through Elara’s agency under the Causal lens, tightening from a search for a single origin to a communal process. Cost is legible in her realization and the act of stamping her own verification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Elara’s investigation, culminating in a non-literal, resonant insight about origins as processes. No moralizing; the final image reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that reflects Elara’s logical, tranquil indexing mind. Diction and syntax remain consistent under pressure, and any elision (e.g., the blackout) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied rhythm and no scaffolds or loops. Figurative language (e.g., "dappled resolve") is purposeful and coherent, and peak beats maintain clarity without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of sunken library, archival detective work, and conceptual closure feels fresh and inevitable. Specificity in details (e.g., the ink stamp’s glyph) elevates the premise beyond template, and risk-taking in quiet intellectual resolution heightens stakes.</comment>
