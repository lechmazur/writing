<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lev's uncertainty transforming into certainty is embodied and earned through micro-choices under pressure, though internal contradiction is minimal, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with palpable cost as the workshop fails; the causal chain from matching to revelation is tight, and the inferred hybrid lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The acid-sea workshop is a vivid, pressure-cooker environment that directly escalates stakes and charges the final inundation, constraining choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dual pressure of unraveling history and dissolving workshop tightens inexorably, with Lev's agency driving revelation and paying a clear physical cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The kintsugi metaphor is richly realized through action and image, though the final paragraph edges toward explicit thematic statement, slightly limiting resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is consistently textured, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic prose that heightens urgency without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is densely poetic yet propulsive, with high information density and no loops or figurative muddle that harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fusion of memory-quilting, kintsugi, and acid-sea post-apocalypse feels fresh, inevitable, and commits fully to its premise with bold stylistic risk.</comment>
