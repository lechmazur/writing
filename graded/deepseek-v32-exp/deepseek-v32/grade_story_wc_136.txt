<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear and interiority embodied, but lacks deep contradictory impulses in scene; some label-speak like "analytically artistic mind" reduces specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causal plot with clear orientation and closure; Decisive Change earned with cost legible in facing personal truths; punch as persistent constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like starlit vault and arrows, but setting sometimes generic; arrows and punch constrain choices, charging the journey but not intensely the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake early signaled; escalation driven by Elara's agency using punch and following arrows; cost of personal revelation unmistakable on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of unraveling truths emerges from journey; subtext in symbols like punch and book; ending resonant but slightly stated in "maps were mere approximations."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV; perceptual signature through Elara's analytical eyes; voice consistent but not highly distinctive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose clear with rhythmic variation, but repetitive stems like "trembling certainty" and "analytically artistic" create minor loops; information density good.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of route mapper, phantom punch, and fortress quest; specific details integrate well but not transformative; emotional truth in personal revelation.</comment>
