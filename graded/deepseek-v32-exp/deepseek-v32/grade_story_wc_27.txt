<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren’s quiet burn and "awkwardly confident" grace are concretely embodied in micro-choices (barefoot on humming rock, using opera glasses). Her final decision to hum the planet's song is earned by prior causality, though the epiphany about the rebellion fighting "only in the present" edges toward diagnostic summary without immediate embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive, on-page Resonant Reconfiguration (the lull breaks, people return) with cost legible in the final silhouettes against the twilight. Causal lens holds tightly: discovery of glyph leads to stone circle, which enables transmission. Orientation is immediate and anchors who, where, when within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the abandoned repair bay’s "thunderous serenity" and the enclosed stone circle constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (cool permacrete, sub-audible hum, violet sky), fully filtered through Maren’s stargazer POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maren’s agency under the causal lens: her investigation tightens from observation to activation, foreclosing passive despair. The cost—transforming the rebellion’s method—is felt in the final image of her people drawn by the song. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—persistence rooted in planetary memory versus imperial technology—emerges organically from the stone circle’s hum and the opera glasses’ repurposing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the merged aria and hum, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature (stargazer’s eye among machinery). Lyrical, rhythmic prose reflects Maren’s contemplative urgency. No head-hopping; all elision (e.g., how the glyph works) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("thunderous serenity," "bled at the horizon") is consistent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion varies perfectly with scene needs, from lull to climactic hum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of sci-fi and ancient mysticism where the stone circle is a biological transmitter. The opera glasses as repurposed heirloom and the "margin of daylight" frame feel organic and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
