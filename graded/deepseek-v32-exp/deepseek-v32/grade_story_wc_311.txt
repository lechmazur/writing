<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied; the reaper's heartbreak and motivation are consistently shown through micro-choices. The final act of crystallizing fears is earned by prior causality with visible cost (temporary crystals, enduring sorrow). Contradictory impulses act in scene—duty versus personal loss—but no diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost: heartbreak remains, crystals will sublime. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; orientation is clear early. Persistent constraint (past failure) shapes tactics; cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the observatory's prism and dome enable the ritual; the atlas page charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the reaper's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens: density increases as fears are crystallized, driven by the reaper's agency. Dominant stake (naming fears) tightens through the ritual; cost is unmistakable in the temporary crystals and unresolved heartbreak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images and actions without moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer: "fragile peace" from mapping fear, reweighting sacrifice and loss. Subtext operates in ritual and echoed phrases.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct perceptual signature; lyrical, rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; voice is consistent and filters through the reaper's bias. Echoed phrases serve as dialogue-like elements with purpose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and supports closure. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with the ritual's pace.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis: a reaper crystallizing fears as penance. Tropes transformed through emotional specificity; risk-taking in lyrical approach heightens stakes. Closure feels inevitable from established particulars.</comment>
