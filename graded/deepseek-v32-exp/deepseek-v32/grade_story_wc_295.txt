<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and contradictory (academic pursuit vs. private guilt). Her final choice to write as a sister is earned by the painful realization triggered by the telegram, with visible cost in her trembling hand and the "profound sorrow." The "heals with words" attribute is dramatized, not just labeled.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara reconfigures her work and grief into a vow, legible in the final image of the telegram beside the new chronicle at dawn. Cost is felt in the "profound sorrow" and the "strange warmth." Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The observatory functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (her midnight solace) and charging the final image (dawn light through the dome). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's POV (soft green glow, brittle pages). The daylily telegram is a recurring object that reweights meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (healing/understanding) escalates via protagonist agency: the telegram forces a reinterpretation of the glyphs, which deepens into the painful realization of missed connection. Cost is legible in her sorrow and the vow that redefines her motivation. One meaningful tightening is sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of shared burdens emerges organically from the specific particulars (variable stars as metaphor, glyph reinterpretation, Cora's telegram). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image and Elara's vow, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt; voice has a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature shaped by Elara's expertise ("charting the whispers of the sky"). Diction and rhythm modulate with emotional intensity, maintaining coherence under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density and clear propulsion. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully with the emotional beat (e.g., "A profound sorrow washed over her..."). Closure image is sharp and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of astronomical decoding and personal grief. The core concept (shared burdens) transforms the familiar "epiphany" trope through specific, grounded choices in character and metaphor. The emotional truth feels singular and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
