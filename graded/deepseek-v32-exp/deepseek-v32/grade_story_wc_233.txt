<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Queen's interiority is concrete and her motivation intensifies under pressure; final renunciation of disenchantment is earned by the climb and shared exhale. Minor diagnostic labeling ("motivation was singular") but embodied emotion dominates; micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: dreams and warning motivate climb, leading to grotto and revelation. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (understanding of lacy menace) with legible cost ("heart lighter yet weighted"). Orientation clear within 120 words; structure tight with one meaningful transition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice (arduous climb, grotto entrance). Cobalt grotto functions as micro-setting that charges the final image; sensory details (luminous blue, dripping hiss) are selective and purposeful through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding her reign) escalates via queen's agency (climb, shared breath). Cost is legible in final resolve; one meaningful tightening (revelation in grotto) forecloses prior disenchantment. Pressure coheres under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of power's fragile beauty emerges through concrete images (bleeding starlight, fireflies) without moralizing. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer; subtext operates in gesture and implication. No thematic echo or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature (poetic, slightly formal). Voice consistent under pressure; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression in descriptive passages; dialogue absent, so not evaluated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language ("lacy menace") is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs; minor risk of overwriting but clarity intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar elements (disenchanted ruler, mystical journey) via specific imagery (bleeding starlight, shared breath). Turns feel earned; perspective is memorable. Some conventional tropes but transformed through grounded choices.</comment>
