<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear and compelling, with internal conflict embodied in "hands steady but heart a drum." His logical and emotional sides drive credible micro-choices under pressure, culminating in an earned success with visible cost in the risk and exertion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal plot tightly links adaptation to threat; closure lands with key sealed and marina calm, cost legible in his exertion and the dispersal of figures. Orientation immediate, lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is integral, with drift-ice and lighthouse constraining choices (e.g., ice affects movement) and charging the final image of placid ice. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Aris's professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Aris's agency as figures approach; one meaningful tightening forces the rite, with cost in precision risk and time pressure. Resolution earned by his vibrational matching under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of harmony vs. dissonance emerges through sonic absolution and imagery; ending offers non-literal resonance without moralizing, though the phrase "logically emotional" is slightly explicit, minor hairline slip.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable, voice blends poetic and technical with a distinct perceptual signature. Diction controls pressure; no head-hopping; elision taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language serves clarity and momentum, even in peak beats like the resonance sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of sonic absolution is fresh and integrated; specifics of vibrational matching and drift-ice setting create organic originality with risk that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
