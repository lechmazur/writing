<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and drives the plot, with interiority shown through curiosity and determination. However, her receptivity is sometimes told rather than vividly embodied, and emotional contradictions are mild, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly; closure is a decisive change (becoming guardian) with cost legible in her advocacy shift. The seed and map constrain tactics, and orientation is immediate, with no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is integral: the quiet brook guides her to the grove, and the corpse flower seed charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtering through Elara's perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (safeguarding innovation) escalate through her agency, from seed to map to threat. Cost is visible in her renewed mission, but the corporate conflict remains off-stage, slightly neatening resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of innovation and protection emerges organically through the seed metaphor and Elara's actions. Subtext is present, though occasional explicit statements ("safeguard space for innovation") lightly limit resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical yet controlled. No dialogue, but elision (e.g., repeated phrases) is taught and pays off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished with varied rhythm and high density, though minor flourishes like "storm-born silence" recur. No artifacts obscure causality; closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of escape room, botanical mystery, and advocacy feels inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific choices, but the concept isn't radically innovative.</comment>
