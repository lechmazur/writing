<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Conductor's mournful eagerness is a consistent driving force, with interiority shown through memories and embodied emotion. However, some emotional beats are told rather than shown (e.g., "mournfully eager" as a label), preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The accumulative structure builds to a resonant reconfiguration where laughter is restored in echo, with a legible cost in its fleeting nature. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds, but the closure lacks the persistent constraint needed for the highest band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel is a vivid, integral setting that amplifies the central concept and charges the final image with restored laughter. Its sensory details are purposeful, but it does not fully constrain choice, and the high-band gate caps the score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake of restoring laughter escalates through the Conductor's active maceration, culminating in a fleeting victory with visible cost—the laughter is only an echo, and the handle slips. Agency is clear under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the specific process of macerating unspoken words to free trapped laughter, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to grief and memory without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV maintains a distinct poetic voice that reflects the Conductor's perception, with controlled rhythm and no head-hopping. The voice is consistent but not quite exceptional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with purposeful repetition, though occasional abstract phrasing ("tended to the unspoken") slightly diminishes concrete immediacy. No major artifacts, but the high-band cap applies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The concept of a leaf-blower conductor macerating regrets in an echo chamber is strikingly original and fully committed, synthesizing elements into a cohesive, haunting whole. Capped due to ineligibility for 8.8+.</comment>
