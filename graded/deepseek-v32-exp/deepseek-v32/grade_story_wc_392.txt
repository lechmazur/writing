<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to resist agency control; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "steadying herself against the tunnel wall"). The final choice to submit the report publicly is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her fortified vulnerability. Minor telling of emotional states ("masked the turmoil") prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a decisive change (public report submission) with felt cost (risk to career). Orientation is immediate; the lantern's entangled memories complicate but do not break causality. The persistent constraint of agency pressure shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choice (damp tunnel, exposed niches). The lantern as object-as-setting constrains discovery and charges the final museum image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through professional POV ("wet pipes and grime").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. control) escalates through Elara's agency: lantern discovery → evidence of struggle → Leo's research → public report. Cost is legible in her "surge of fortified vulnerability." One meaningful tightening (finding scuff marks) forces a trade-off, though the climax is slightly summarized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the lantern's reweighted meaning, linking historical freedom to modern justice. Subtext operates in gesture and image (lantern's glow as guide). Slight explicitness in "the fight for dignity against oppression" nudges down from a higher band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; voice has a distinct perceptual signature ("watchfully calm," "fortified vulnerability"). Some register drift into abstract phrasing ("emotional storm") in peak beats, but elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with purposeful rhythm, but exhibits minor overwriting ("faint, watery echoes") and therapy-speak labels ("fortified vulnerability") in high-pressure beats. No loops or scaffold; closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes procedural investigation with historical symbolism and a touch of the supernatural (entangled memories) in a fresh, non-obvious way. The lantern's transformation from artifact to clue is specific and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
