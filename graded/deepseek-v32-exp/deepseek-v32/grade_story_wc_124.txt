<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's interior contradiction (curiosity vs. fear) is dramatized in scene; his final renunciation of fear is earned through the vial's revelation with visible cost in tears. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are consistently character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Silas understands his purpose; cost is legible in "the tears came instantly." Orientation is early and clear; the accumulative lens holds throughout with the UV light as a persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting constrains choice (UV revelation) and charges the final image ("cathedral of faint blue lines"). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Silas's expertise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Silas's agency in opening the vial; the stake (understanding tears) tightens through disappointment to discovery, with unmistakable cost in the grief for lost memory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the concrete action; the ending offers a non-literal answer ("tears were the price of holding a ghost") that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and stable, with a lyrical perceptual signature ("crystal shadows," "chemical ghosts") that reflects Silas's worldview; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and enhances clarity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise of a greenhouse for extinct plants and a lantern broker studying scents is fresh; synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
