<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's face-blindness and methodical nature are concretely embodied and drive her choices. Her motivation to awaken empathy is dramatized through her struggle with the victim's portrait, and the final shift to "see with the heart" is earned by the journal's contents. Minor: empathy awakening is slightly swift but does not break causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly: because she is methodical, she deduces the evidence is still at the quarry and finds it. Closure is a decisive change (awakened empathy) with felt cost ("surge of empathy, long dormant, awaken painfully"). Orientation is immediate and stable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The quarry is vividly rendered and constrains choice (she climbs to find the box). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's perception. The setting charges the final image as mist lifts, mirroring her clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solve case/awaken empathy) escalates through her agency: going to the quarry, using her method, finding the box. Cost is legible in the painful empathy surge. One meaningful tightening (realizing evidence is still there) forecloses other options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of masks, truth, and unifying opposites emerges organically from particulars (ribbon, face-blindness, quarry). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "see with the heart." No moralizing; subtext operates in images and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with a distinct perceptual signature: methodical, precise, and filtered through Elara's face-blindness. Voice modulates with emotional intensity without head-hopping. Diction remains within her lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and no artifact loops. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful. Sentences advance story and character without scaffolding or redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise (face-blind artist solves cold case) is fresh and fully committed. Synthesis of methodical deduction and emotional awakening feels inevitable. Risk-taking in concept and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
