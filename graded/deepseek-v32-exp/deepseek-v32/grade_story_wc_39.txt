<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Arlo's motivation is clear and consistent, driving his choices from sound collection to music box repair. Interiority is concrete and embodied in actions like "tenderly attuned to loss." His transformation from collector to composer is earned by on-page causality, with cost felt in his commitment to stay. Minor deduction for lack of strong contradictory impulses, but final choice is credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sound patterns to a Conceptual Repricing where Arlo becomes a "composer of memory." Orientation is clear early. Closure lands with cost in his dedicated solitude, and the music box/jars constraint shapes tactics. No causality breaks; pattern teaches and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—"feral loft beneath the dunes"—with sensory details filtered through Arlo's bias. The jars and music box function as micro-setting, constraining choices and charging the final image. Atmosphere of "lonesome splendor" is woven into action, supporting theme without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving voices) escalates under accumulative lens via density increase: incomplete collection → music box discovery → translation breakthrough. Agency drives each beat; cost is legible in Arlo's renunciation of despair. One meaningful tightening suffices, though escalation is more incremental than causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and translation emerges organically from jars, music box, and Arlo's actions. Subtext in gestures like sweetening gears with honey. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer with "preserved time" as currency, avoiding moralizing. Coherent and earned through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct lyrical voice ("dawn's earliest whistle"). Perceptual signature reflects Arlo's poetic attention; rhythm modulates with emotional beats. No head-hopping; purposeful compression in sound-capturing method is taught and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; sentences vary structure to support accumulative drive. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Figurative language ("cavern of driftwood and stubborn memory") is consistent and voice-motivated. Closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sound-jarring and memory preservation feels inevitable. Concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No template reliance; emotional specificity anchors freshness.</comment>
