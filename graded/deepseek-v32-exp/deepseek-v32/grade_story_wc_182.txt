<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is consistent and shown through competent micro-choices (using the diary, crafting a rope). However, her "carefully resourceful" trait is demonstrated more as flawless competence than a flaw-driven struggle; internal contradiction and embodied emotional cost under pressure are minimal, keeping the character from deeper complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal linkages are clear and the closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing (the Library is a state of reading). The cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt, but the reconfiguration of the quest's premise is legible and earned by prior beats. Some convenience (diary's perfect relevance) slightly softens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, constraining choices and supplying resources (light-moss, fungal patterns, shifting shelves). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, fully filtered through Elara's expertise. The bookstore's nature directly pressures tactics and charges the final image of the "profound, resonant absence."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake (rescue/find library) escalates through coherent obstacles under the causal lens, each solved by Elara's agency. However, the cost remains conceptual; the stakes lack a visceral, personal price. The final reweighting is intellectual, narrowing the felt tension required for the highest band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme (knowledge, silence, unlearned lessons) emerges organically from the quest and the final, non-literal revelation. The "unheard symphony" motif is effectively reprised. Subtext is present, though the thematic resolution is elegant rather than deeply complex or ambivalent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with a distinct, slightly academic texture fitting the linguist protagonist. Voice remains consistent under pressure. No head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but functional. The perceptual signature is clear, though occasional dense description risks slight opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is vividly imaginative but occasionally dense, with figurative language stacking in high-pressure beats ("profound, resonant absence"). Minor scaffold phrasing ("her world...shattered") and a tendency toward ornate description create slight momentum drag, though clarity and propulsion are generally maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of magical bookstore, time travel, and linguistic magic is fresh and specific. The core premise is transformed through grounded, lived-in detail (the botanical diary, fungal navigation). The final conceptual turn feels earned and non-obvious, demonstrating authentic vision and risk-taking.</comment>
