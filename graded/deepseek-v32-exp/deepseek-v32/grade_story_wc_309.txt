<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and intensifies, driving her to the spire and the keystone. Her internal shift from underachiever to custodian is earned through specific, embodied perceptions and choices, with the cost of rejecting automated magic felt in the final image. The single POV is deeply interior without diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise) as Lyra becomes a custodian, with cost legible in her rejection of the guild's values. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, tightening through her deepening perception. Orientation is immediate and clean.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The icebound spire and keystone are indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Lyra's perception, creating a vivid atmosphere that pressures and enables her discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (finding the sacred in the simple) escalate via Lyra's agency—inviting the light, mending the spire—under an Accumulative lens. The cost, a turn from automated efficiency to fragile custodianship, is unmistakable and reweights the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete events and images, avoiding statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of Lyra as a custodian of lingering luminance, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, precise, and attuned to subtle sensory shifts. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and purposeful elision (e.g., "uncounted hours") supports momentum without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without overwriting or loops. Sentences vary rhythmically, propelling the accumulative texture. No figurative muddle or scaffolding artifacts; closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of automated magic and personal, fragile wonder feels fresh and inevitable. Specificity in the keystone, mist walking, and luminous residue transforms a familiar trope. Risk-taking in quiet, reflective tone heightens stakes.</comment>
