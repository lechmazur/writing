<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Leo's motivation is clear and consistent, driving his choices; Eliza's internal conflict (fear vs. curiosity) is shown through action. However, some emotional depth is told rather than embodied, and the relationship development is slightly summary-driven, though the final choice (Eliza joining Leo) is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly; orientation is immediate. Closure is a decisive change (Eliza becomes apprentice) with legible cost (life transposition). Backstory is anchored in present cues, and the plot advances via because/therefore linkages without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting is vivid and integral, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details (storm, jars) are selective and purposeful, though some descriptions lean generic ("storm raged"). Spatial choreography is clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transposing lives via open secrets) escalates through Leo's agency (writing Eliza's fortune) and Eliza's response. Cost is legible in her commitment to a new path. Pressure tightens causally, though resolution is somewhat swift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of open secrets and transformation emerges through concrete events and metaphors ("transpose life into a new key"). Subtext operates in fortunes and imagery. Minimal moralizing; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via the lighthouse beacon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited with clean shifts to Eliza's perspective at breaks; voice is consistent and lyrical ("silent sentinel"). POV distance is stable, and dialogue (when present) is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean and evocative, but minor repetitive phrasing ("orchestrate," "familiar enigma") and occasional telling sentences slightly dull momentum. No artifacts that obscure closure; rhythm supports scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of spycraft, fortune cookies, and lighthouse mystery feels organic and fresh. Premise is committed to and transformed through specific details (microdots, open secrets). Emotional truth anchors the concept.</comment>
