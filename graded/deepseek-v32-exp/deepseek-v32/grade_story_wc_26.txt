<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices under pressure are deliberate. However, interiority leans abstract ("luminous regret") and lacks contradictory impulses or genuine flaw, limiting depth. The final choice is earned but the cost feels slightly reported rather than fully embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean and closure lands with a decisive change (dreamscape transformed) and resonant reconfiguration (luminous regret). Orientation is immediate. The resolution, while logical, leans slightly neat; the cost is legible but the shadow's integration is resolved without significant friction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and purposefully filtered through Elara's perception. The river stone acts as a micro-setting object that charges the final image. Sensory details are selective, though slightly weighted toward visual and ethereal over tactile.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving hope) is clear and escalates through Elara's agency—observation to intervention. A meaningful tightening occurs when she programs counter-dreams. Cost is on the page, but the conflict is more contemplative than tense, and the escalation is straightforward.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of change versus preservation emerges organically from the dream library and river stone motifs. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (hope finds a new shape) though the phrase "luminous regret" edges toward thematic statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and voice is consistently lyrical, with a distinct perceptual signature. No dialogue; prose rhythm is controlled. Some abstraction in interiority, but distance and focus remain coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished with varied syntax and purposeful figurative language. No major artifacts; repetition of "softly deliberate" and "luminous regret" feels intentional. Information density is high, though a few phrases verge on ornamental.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dream library and unbound shadow offer a fresh, coherent concept. Emotional specificity (regret tempered by acceptance) elevates a familiar preservation theme. Execution is organic, though the resolution follows a predictable arc.</comment>
