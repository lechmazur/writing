<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and drives the story, but interiority remains abstract and lacks contradictory impulses; Elias's transition from observer to actor is earned but without visible struggle or embodied cost, limiting emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost (ghosts fading); accumulative lens holds with a clear before/after; the covenant's constraint shapes tactics, though the cost is subtle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, constraining choices and charging the final image; the stained glass box and oasis decay are woven into action and perception with selective sensory detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (renewing the covenant) escalates through Elias's agency after the ghost's prompt, tightening under the accumulative lens; cost is legible but quiet, lacking visceral pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken words and mute eloquence emerges organically through images and actions; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer, though a final statement verges on explicit moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice that reflects Elias's perceptive nature; no dialogue, but perceptual signature and rhythmic control are consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is polished with varied rhythm and high information density; some abstract phrasing but no loops or artifacts that obscure closure; capped due to high-band entry gate conditions unmet.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic beekeeping, visible ghosts, and a stained glass covenant feels fresh and inevitable; specificity and emotional truth elevate, though capped per high-band entry gate.</comment>
