<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her traits as a survivor and artist; interiority is concrete through observation and compulsion, with an earned change dramatized in the final creation. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; cost is visible in her adaptation and the glass slab.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from ledger discovery to path retracing and creation. Closure is a decisive change with cost legible in the "scorched testament" image; orientation is anchored within first 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: canyon provides ledger and silica, frost patterns guide method. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, charging the final image with environmental resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose) escalates through Elara's agency—retracing path, discovering cave, creating slab—with one meaningful tightening. Cost is felt in the creation process and final artifact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fragility and hidden history emerges from images (frost, ledger, silica) without statement; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through the glass slab's "scorched testament."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice aligned to Elara's artistic perception; no head-hopping; diction and rhythm control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, advancing story without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and clear; sentence-level propulsion supports emotional beats and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of glass artist, smuggler's ledger, and hidden creation feels organic and inevitable; lyrical risk-taking elevates stakes without gimmickry, and closure reweights prior material.</comment>
