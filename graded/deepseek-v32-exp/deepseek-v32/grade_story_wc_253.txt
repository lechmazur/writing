<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Leo's contradictory impulses—cultivating lightness while harboring illegal grief—are embodied in his rituals; final equilibrium is earned through whittling and narration, with the cost of emotional void legible on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a Charged Poise where Leo finds "a strange, light equilibrium" with clear cost in the emotional void; orientation is immediate and persistent constraints shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Turbines and farmhouse create an oppressive, specific atmosphere; the dried bouquet and whittling tools constrain choice and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal resistance to mandated joy; escalation occurs through increasing density of ritual and reflection, culminating in a reweighted equilibrium with visible cost under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of private grief versus enforced joy emerges through concrete images and actions; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in the "light equilibrium," avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with a lyrical, detached voice that matches Leo's performative emptiness; perceptual signature is distinct and rhythmic control supports pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with purposeful figurative language; no loops or scaffold. Minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "liquid diamonds") slightly tempers the score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-mandate dystopia with quiet, craft-centered resistance; specific choices (whittling, dramatic narration) feel inevitable and heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
