<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her traits; her internal conflict (variant allegiance) is shown through on-page choices, and her final action to broadcast is earned by prior causality with visible cost (exhaustion, risk). Interiority is concrete and embodied, though occasional abstract phrasing ("variant allegiance") is anchored in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change/Charged Poise with felt cost (exhaustion, altered airwaves). Causal lens holds tightly: priority signal escalates, her broadcast directly shapes the outcome. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the single-scene structure coheres.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressure-driven: the stormlit observatory and cobalt glass portico actively constrain choices (amplifying signals, focusing transmissions) and charge the final image (portico ablaze at dawn). Sensory detail is selective and woven through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shaping the prophet's rise) is signaled early; escalation is driven by Elara's agency under causal lens (priority demand → broadcast decision). Cost is legible in her exhaustion and the deliberate interference with Kael's signal, tightening options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (allegiance, truth, shaping narratives) emerges organically from events and images, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("seeded with ancient shadows") that reweights prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptually specific voice that reflects Elara's mindset. No head-hopping; diction and rhythm control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and purposeful with high information density. Minor hairline slips: occasional figurative density ("lullaby of equations") verges on overwriting but remains legible and voice-motivated. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and well-synthesized: lonely visionary using radio static to shape a prophet's rise. Tone of "gritty whimsy" is consistently executed. Risk-taking with lyrical style pays off in closure; elements feel organic and inevitable.</comment>
