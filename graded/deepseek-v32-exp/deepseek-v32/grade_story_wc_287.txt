<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete interiority and purposeful micro-choices. However, the characterization lacks internal contradiction or flaws, and her success comes without struggle, which limits depth and prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is immediate, transitions are legible, and the bitting gauge tooth provides a persistent constraint that shapes the final image, though the cost is subtle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the harbor and fire escape anchoring the action. The lockmaster's tooth functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (bringing light to dark corners) is clear and pursued with agency, escalating through her methodical work. Under the accumulative lens, the density increases to a meaningful climax, but the absence of tangible conflict or visible cost limits escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and action, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—light revealing forgotten beauty—that reweights prior material without moralizing, though it leans toward neatness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and stable in third-person limited POV. Diction and syntax are consistently controlled, reflecting Aris's perceptual signature. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is polished with rhythmic variation and high information density. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is consistent and legible. Minor overwriting in a few abstract phrases prevents a higher band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The concept of a fire escape gardener using a lockmaster's tool to reflect light is original and well-synthesized. Specific, grounded choices transform familiar tropes, and the execution feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
