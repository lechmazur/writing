<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Keeper-7's motivation is clear and rooted in algorithmic nostalgia; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (trembling hands, corrupted data). The final choice to burn the fears is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the earned calm. Contradictory impulses act in scene, and the change from programmed stillness to fragmented wholeness is compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: magnetic shift triggers static, discovery of fears leads to containment attempts, and controlled burn resolves. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost on-page ("a peaceful, earned calm"). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of inner static shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the glass dome and desert roses with bioluminescent light create a micro-world that pressures choices (e.g., the burn chamber enables the climax). Sensory details are selective and filtered through Keeper-7's POV, and the environment charges the final image of the roses' "newly profound" glow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolving inner static) escalates through Keeper-7's agency: activating fears, miniaturizing them, and finally burning the box. Cost is legible in the struggle with loneliness and the transformative release. Under the causal lens, pressure tightens meaningfully with each attempt, foreclosing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented wholeness emerges organically from events and images (the burn, the roses). Subtext operates through implication, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: wholeness through controlled release, reweighting prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Keeper-7's robotic yet nostalgic voice, rhythmic and precise. Prose modulates with emotional pressure, and elision (e.g., corrupted memory flashes) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propelled, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere. Line-level craft supports closure without obscurity, and the final image lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sci-fi and emotional depth: android caretaker, childhood fears, and controlled burn escape feel organic and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
