<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in steadfast curiosity, driving micro-choices like using the watch fob as collateral. Interiority is concrete ("comforting unease settled in her bones"), and her final understanding of the hush is earned through causal pressure. Minor deduction for limited internal contradiction, but closure cost is legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from false starts to the high-stakes deal. Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change: capturing the sound and realizing the value of the hush, with cost felt in "some silences are bought and some are earned." Orientation is anchored early, no penalties.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific ("salt-stained planks," "shifting lantern light") and constrains choice through the truce of hush, shaping Elara's tactics. The pirate market functions as micro-setting that charges the final image with palpable unease, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing sound for father's freedom) escalates under causal lens via Elara's agency, from failed attempts to the volatile captain deal. Cost is unmistakable in the risk to the watch fob and the resigned exhalation captured, tightening options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of trust, silence, and cost emerges organically through events, not statement. Subtext operates in gestures and silence; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Elara's realization about the hush, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical yet urgent, filtering through Elara's curiosity. Voice modulates with pressure ("tension was a living thing, a thick silence"), and any elision (e.g., the hush) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("eyes like tide pools") is controlled and purposeful, advancing momentum. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, and closure image is clear without artifact muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Concept of capturing "the sound of trust breaking" is fresh and synthesized with pirate-market tropes through specific details. Turns feel earned, and risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Slight deduction for not being fully groundbreaking, but integration is seamless.</comment>
