<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Liren's motivation is clear and rooted in regret, with his final act earned by decades of study; however, internal conflict is more reflective than dynamically contradictory in scene, slightly limiting peak emotional embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from crime to atonement; closure lands with on-page cost in exhaustion and unraveling, and the groove/thorn constraint shapes tactics decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary and aurora are vivid and purposeful, constraining choice via the groove and charging the final image with the deepening twilight; sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of atonement escalates through Liren's agency as he realizes the circuit and unwrites; cost is legible in his exhaustion and the profound unraveling felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Themes of forgiveness and atonement emerge organically from concrete actions; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the unwriting image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and immersive, with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature; rhythm controls the contemplative pace without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is elegant and dense, with varied rhythm and zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is precise, and sentence-level propulsion supports the climax without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of calligraphy forgery, rose thorn, and unwriting feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet resolution heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
