<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eli's interiority is concrete and contradiction is shown through his "hard softness." Motivation to translate pain is clear and intensifies, compelling his choice to share. The final renunciation of private suffering for shared song is earned by prior reflection. Minor deduction for occasional diagnostic label-speak ("bargained innocence") in peak beats, but embodied cost follows within lines.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is clear and held. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Eli crystallizes his readiness to translate pain, with cost legible in the transformed view of his scars and box. The single-scene structure with reflective shards teaches its pattern early; orientation is immediate and anchors serve closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge and cracked porcelain box function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Eli's bias. The celestial bodies motif is slightly decorative, but the box and pine cone constrain reflection and symbolize endurance, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for an object constraining choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transforming private pain into connection) is signaled early. Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a deepening through reflection that reweights the stake, leading to Eli's agency in choosing to share. Cost is visible in his acceptance of his "bargained innocence" as transformation, not loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars (pine cone, box, scars). Subtext operates in gesture and image. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—pain as a "song others could hear"—without moralizing. The concept of "bargained innocence" is slightly over-articulated but remains earned through dramatized experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt; voice is lyrical, reflective, and distinct, with perceptual signature in Eli's fire-shaped attention. Syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; elision (memory surges) is taught and pays off in closure. Diction remains within character's plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts: some overwriting ("slow dance of celestial bodies" repeated) and a slight figurative pile-up ("hard softness" reiterated). However, these do not obscure causality or dull closure; information density remains high and momentum sustained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of firefighter trauma with philosophical reflection feels fresh and specific. Tropes (scarred hero) are transformed through grounded, idiosyncratic detail (cracked box, pine cone). The closure image is inevitable in hindsight. Some abstraction ("universal language") is balanced by concrete symbolism, showing authentic vision.</comment>
