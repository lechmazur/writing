<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear and consistent, embodied in micro-choices like embedding responses in scores and aiming the radio's glow. However, interior contradiction is minimal; his determination faces little internal friction, making the final endurance feel more declared than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each step (listening, copying, using the glow) leads to the dust's response. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with Aris achieving his goal and vowing to continue. Conceptual cost (defying the famine) is legible but not deeply felt on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ember alcove, mist, and radio glow are vividly specific and integral. The dial's glow acts as a micro-setting that constrains choice (aiming it at dust) and charges the final image, transforming the environment into a vessel for stories.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes (rebuilding narrative) are clear; escalation is driven by Aris's agency (responding to broadcasts, experimenting with the glow). A meaningful tightening occurs when the dust moves, but the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of art as clandestine resistance emerges organically through coded lyrics, light, and dust. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—stories glimmering on surfaces—without moralizing, and the central metaphor is sustained.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, precise perceptual signature. The voice modulates between quiet observation and heightened revelation, maintaining coherence and control even under the story's emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythmic control, though occasionally leans toward decorative phrasing (e.g., "thistled calm"). No loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and supports the atmosphere without muddling clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise—teaching dust to remember stories via pirate radio in a post-famine world—is a fresh, specific synthesis. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
