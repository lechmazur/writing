<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear and his final choice to map the echo is earned, but the story lacks internal contradiction or deep emotional complexity, keeping characterization from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight; closure lands with palpable cost ("forever after measuring the wind") and the inferred lens holds without break; the persistent constraint of the phenomenon shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The container labyrinth actively constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, fully integrated with Aris's investigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Aris's agency; the cost of his shifted mandate is legible on the page, with one meaningful tightening that forecloses conventional reporting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of mapping the echo, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; the prose has a distinct perceptual signature matching Aris's analytical mind, with controlled elision and rhythmic variation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is impeccable; high information density without loops or scaffold; sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language remains clear even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of investigative realism with a speculative phenomenon feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in the conceptual repricing pays off with a fully integrated, singular vision.</comment>
