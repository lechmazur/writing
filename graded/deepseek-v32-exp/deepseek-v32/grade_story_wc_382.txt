<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Alex's motivation is clear and intensifies; his internal conflict between accepting lies and seeking literal truth leads to an earned shift in understanding. The final choice to embrace the lies as doors is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the building's groan and the seal's weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain from borrowing sugar to rooftop interrogation holds; closure is a decisive change and resonant reconfiguration with felt cost (relinquishing literal translation). The lens (Causal/Hybrid) is consistent and the ending reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated, from the weathered building to the meteor-shower rooftop; the antique seal and garden constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes (learning the language) escalate through Alex's agency; his interrogation forces a revelation that reconfigures the cost (accepting mystery). The tightening is meaningful and the cost is legible in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of language, truth, and perception emerges through lies, the seal, and the final revelation; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct; prose has a poetic, controlled rhythm; dialogue is cryptic and goal-driven. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished, dense, and rhythmic; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and clear. Sentence-level propulsion supports the climax and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and organic; the synthesis of dead languages, building whispers, and agreed-upon lies feels inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet, philosophical resolution heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
