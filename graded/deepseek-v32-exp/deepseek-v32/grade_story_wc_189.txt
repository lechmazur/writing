<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's warmly observant nature is concretely embodied through selective perception and micro-choices (tracing the cicada, sharing it). Interiority is specific to her expertise, and her final action is earned by prior reflection, though Kael remains slightly thin.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing) where Kael's "low tide" realization reweights the stake with felt cost in the shared silence. The jade cicada persists as a constraint that shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and filtered through Elara's POV, with the grotto pool and jade cicada acting as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and integrated into her reflective stance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (relationship fracture) escalates via Elara's tangential agency under the Accumulative lens; a single meaningful tightening occurs when her insight shifts the conversation's rhythm, with cost legible in the softened anger and shared understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transition emerges organically through concrete particulars (tidal pools, cicada, drip rings). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the "low tide" metaphor without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—Elara's observational, metaphorical voice. Syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional pressure, and any elision (e.g., the conversation details) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and clear, advancing character and atmosphere. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with the reflective pace, and closure is undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal-pool chronicler, jade cicada, and tangential foresight feels organic and inevitable. Specific details transform familiar tropes, and the quiet risk heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
