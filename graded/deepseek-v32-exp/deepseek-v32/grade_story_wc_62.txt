<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elm's interiority is concrete and his motivation clear; the shift from despair to clarity is earned through the poem-reading and spectral guidance. His "fiercely meditative" trait summons the ghost, and his final choice to carve the weave is a credible renunciation of his earlier, isolating approach. Contradictory impulses are present but not heavily dramatized; the change is well-motivated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where grief is reweighted as a tapestry, with cost legible in Elm's abandonment of his solitary monument approach. Orientation is clear within 120 words; the ribbon roll and migration pattern teach the accumulation that leads to revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmosphere charged; the greenhouse and butterfly migration provide a resonant backdrop. The ribbon roll functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice (reading the poems) and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding collective grief) is signaled early and deepens via accumulation of poems and the ribbon's map. Escalation is driven by Elm's agency in reading and drawing; cost is visible in his renunciation of the old carving method.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the poems, ribbon, and migration; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (grief as a tapestry) without moralizing. Subtext is rich, and the final image reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, with a distinct lyrical voice that matches the meditative tone. Perceptual signature is strong; dialogue is sparse but natural; no head-hopping. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished, dense, and rhythmically varied; figurative language is consistent and effective. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Information density is high, and the closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of gravestone carving, spectral mentorship, family poems, and migration feels inevitable. The ribbon roll as a map of grief is a fresh, specific inflection that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
