<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and drives the narrative, but internal contradiction is minimal, and some diagnostic language ("questioning assumptions") slightly reduces depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost under an accumulative lens; the lens as key shapes tactics, and the transformation from mausoleum to bridge is legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bell ringing, lost sounds, and miner's lens; concept feels inevitable and risk-taking heightens stakes.</comment>
