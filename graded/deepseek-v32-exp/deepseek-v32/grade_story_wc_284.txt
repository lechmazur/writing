<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aris's interiority is concretely embodied through tactile details like the worn pillbox and trembling hands. His motivation sharpens under pressure, compelling the decisive choice to seek Elara. The final renunciation of isolation for vulnerability is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal linkage tightens from decoded coordinates to the resolve to face Elara. Orientation is immediate, and closure lands with a felt cost of potential rejection. The persistent constraint of the engraved helix and snow-preserved code shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The bluff's mist and snow are not just backdrop but essential constraints, preserving the cipher and charging the final image of thaw. Sensory selection reflects Aris's urgency, with details like frosted pines and damp snow woven into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake of finding courage escalates through Aris's agency in decoding, forcing a trade-off between safety and vulnerability. Cost is legible in the risk of rejection, and the tightening from mystery to personal confrontation is meaningful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the helix motif and the shift from espionage to empathy. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: courage waits in the space between fear and action, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature that filters the world through Aris's weary, determined lens. The poetic rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, maintaining control without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propelled, with figurative language that serves character and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold obscure causality; sentence-level rhythm supports the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The spy trope is transformed through a focus on internal repair and vulnerability. Specific synthesis—like the pillbox's evolution from escape to return—feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the quiet, literary stance.</comment>
