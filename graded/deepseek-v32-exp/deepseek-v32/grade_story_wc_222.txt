<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Arin's motivation and traits are clear and consistent, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; his determination is steady without deep internal conflict. Emotions are embodied (e.g., breath fogging), but the final choice, while earned, doesn't showcase a visible cost beyond physical risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate. Closure is a decisive change (sky restored) with cost legible in the escape from the collapsing spire. The pocket sundial serves as a persistent constraint shaping tactics, but the cost feels more procedural than emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (ice, violet light) filtered through Arin's wonder. The spire and pocket sundial actively constrain choices and charge the final image. Micro-setting (chessboard chamber) integrates with action, though spatial choreography during escape is briefly summarized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sky balance) signaled early; escalation driven by Arin's agency under causal lens (using sundial, swapping pieces). Cost is visible in the physical peril of escape, but tension remains moderate without severe tightening of options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of sacred play emerges organically from actions and symbols (chess pieces, sundial). Subtext through imagery, but occasional direct statements ("essence of being sacredly playful") lean toward moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Arin's wiser stance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with a consistent lyrical voice attuned to wonder. Perception is character-specific (noticing mystical details). Minimal dialogue; prose rhythm supports pressure without head-hopping, though voice isn't strikingly distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmic with purposeful variation. Information density is high; sentences advance plot and atmosphere. Minor ornamentation ("cautious abandon") but no loops or figurative muddle. Closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of thief fantasy and cosmic stakes, transformed through specific details (chivalrous thief, apprentice of wonder). Concept feels organic, but emotional complexity is modest; risk-taking is present but not bold enough for higher bands.</comment>
