<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in trait; interiority is embodied (e.g., "kindred chaos"); final change earned by prior causality with visible cost on page when he accepts imperfect rhythms.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure lands with decisive change and cost legible in compass pointing to his heart; orientation anchored early; no plot breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (greenhouse leaves reveal draft) and charges final image (waterfall's roar); sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (befriending uncertainty) escalates via protagonist agency; improvisation under pressure narrows options with cost visible in renunciation of rigid planning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and image; admiral's letter and final realization offer resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext in compass spin.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature (tinkerer's time-focused notice); voice consistent and lyrical, rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language effective ("cave of silent ticks"); no loops or scaffold; sentence variety supports rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of treasure hunt and internal growth; tropes transformed through specific details; risk-taking in philosophical insight heightens stakes.</comment>
