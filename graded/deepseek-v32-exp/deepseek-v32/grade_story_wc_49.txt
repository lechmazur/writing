<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in trait, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses; emotional embodiment is present but somewhat performed, reducing depth under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with felt cost (warmth, shift in arbor) under an Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation is early and clear, and the vine/songs constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposeful; the vine tendril as micro-setting constrains choice and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency through song and vine response, with a clear tightening at the celestial alignment; cost is legible in the restoration's imprint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from ritual and image; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though slightly explicit in final lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice has a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control, but capped due to Q2 not reaching 9.0; POV is stable and consistent with the whimsical tinkerer's perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm; no loops or scaffold artifacts, though some may find it slightly ornate, but clarity and propulsion are maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tinkerer, vine, and forgotten songs feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
