<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Juro's watchful patience is embodied and consistent, his motivation clarified through the donor heart's signal and the wing's revelation. The final choice to descend at dawn is earned by the accumulated pattern, though the abstract initial want ("to learn why some people magnetize stories") lacks contradictory impulses or visible internal conflict, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; closure is a Charged Poise (decision to descend) with legible cost (reciprocal grace). The persistent constraint of the donor heart shapes tactics. Orientation is immediate; the sun‑trail/map revelation tightens cleanly, though the mystical connection (heart thump as narrative memory) slightly softens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is integral: the floating tea house enables precise light angles; the morpho wing as micro‑setting constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered (dye master’s eye for light). However, per the 9+ gate (Q2 <9.0), capped at 8.8.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honoring the donor’s story) escalates through Juro’s attentive agency, culminating in the decision to descend. Cost is legible (“act of reciprocal grace”). Under the accumulative lens, the deepening of knowledge (wing as map) reweights options, though the pressure remains contemplative rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (attention as a form of grace) emerges organically from concrete particulars—sun trails, wing, heart thump—and resolves in a resonant, non‑literal final image. No moralizing; the ending reweights prior material. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 <9.0.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Juro’s dye‑master profession. Lyrical, contemplative voice remains consistent under pressure; no head‑hopping. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 <9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense, polished, and artifact‑free; sentences advance character and atmosphere with rhythmic control. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. High information density. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 <9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of donor‑heart memory, morpho‑wing map, and dye‑master observation feels fresh and inevitable. The quiet, accumulative risk heightens stakes without gimmickry. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 <9.0.</comment>
