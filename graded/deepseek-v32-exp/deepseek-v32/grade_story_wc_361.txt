<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Kael's journey from jittery to steady is earned through embodied emotion and micro-choices; his final act of placing the pendant arises from contradictory impulses resolved with visible cost (pendant's destruction).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a conceptual repricing where Kael's understanding of his role transforms, with cost legible in the pendant's crumbling and the permanent shoot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, fully integrated with POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by pendant's resonance and Kael's agency; stakes shift from delivery to germination with on-page cost in the artifact's fulfillment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of wonder in routine emerges organically from particulars; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, via the image of germination.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature consistent; no head-hopping; elision taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of courier trope with germination concept; specific details like dragonfly-wing pendant and vibrating sympathy make it indispensable.</comment>
