<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ezra's "volcanic tenderness" motive is embodied through destructive arson and redemptive curation; internal conflict between guilt and salvation drives micro-choices, and the final resolve is earned by causal chain with visible cost ("cooled lava" transformation). No diagnostic label-speak in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from library fire to diorama discovery; closure is a decisive change (arsonist to curator) with felt cost in "volcanic heat... cooling into a new, tender resolve"; orientation anchors early, no elision debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges closure: archive's art trail guides tactics, diorama's "gentle glow" reweights the final image; sensory detail selective and POV-filtered ("ash," "soot," "cool and still air").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescuing forgotten promise) escalates via protagonist agency under causal lens: each deciphering act narrows options; cost legible in guilt transformed to resolve, foreclosing broadcast path for art trail.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of destruction/preservation emerges through particulars (arson, art archive, diorama); ending offers non-literal answer via Ezra becoming curator without moralizing; subtext in "volcanic tenderness" imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature ("analytically intuitive mind" filters observations); voice modulates from ash to glow without head-hopping; compression (e.g., geographic cipher) taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control; no loops or scaffold; figurative language ("volcanic tenderness," "cooled lava") consistent and heightens closure; sentence propulsion matches scene urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arsonist-redemption and art-as-history tropes through specific details (tapestry, vandalized portrait); risk-taking in quiet closure with art trail recharges prior material; transformation feels inevitable.</comment>
