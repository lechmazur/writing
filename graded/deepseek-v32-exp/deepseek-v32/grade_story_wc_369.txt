<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's quiet obsession is concrete and his actions align, but interior contradiction and micro-choices under pressure are subdued; the final sharing of witness is earned but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (sorrow fading) with conceptual cost legible in the final image. The pin sound serves as a pattern break that coheres the dream-mist, though the causality is soft.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly selective and charges the final image (the ancient yew tree). Moonlight and tower pressure the opening beat; sensory details are filtered through Silas's professional attention.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deconstructing sorrow) escalates via the pin's sound, a pattern break under the accumulative lens. Silas's rush to the tree and shared witness constitute a meaningful tightening with a clear, though quiet, cost of release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of witnessing and release emerges through concrete particulars (sextant, pin, tree) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the fading sorrow and shared vision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm is controlled and matches Silas's methodical, observant nature. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Polished, dense prose with varied rhythm and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and clear. Minor cap applied due to Q2 not meeting 9+ gate, else would score higher.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mundane maintenance and magical realism; the broken sextant and quantified sorrow feel organic and inevitable. The concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting.</comment>
