<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear and drives the plot, with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure. However, the "confidently uncertain" trait is more stated than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene, limiting the depth of internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate. Closure lands with a decisive change—the signals return, changed—and cost is legible in the new dialect and the pen's resonance, making the edit to history feel earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly and the exotic pen are not just backdrop; they pressure choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through Aris's expertise, and the setting's malleability is woven into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (restore signals, thresh meaning) escalate via Aris's agency: mapping relationships and transmitting the corrective sequence. Cost is visible in the altered signals and the anomaly's integrated harmony, tightening options under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of editing history by integrating error emerges through concrete particulars—the pen, the anomaly, the algorithm—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "wrong seeds had grown into an unexpected harvest."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature blending scientific precision and introspective ritual. Voice modulates with pressure, and purposeful compression (e.g., "confidently uncertain") is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmically varied, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful, and the final image lands with clarity. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates appropriately toward the transmission beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravitational anomaly, signal interpretation, and a meteoritic pen feels fresh and inevitable. Core concept of editing history is fully committed, transforming a mistake into a deeper connection without gimmickry.</comment>
