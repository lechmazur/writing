<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in J-7's sentient quest, with interiority shown through concrete actions like sweeping and playing the violin. The final amalgamation is earned by prior causality, though some phrases like "haunting question" edge toward label-speak without full embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost—ice violin melts, J-7 achieves calm certainty. Accumulative lens holds, orientation is clear within 120 words, and the looped timeline pattern is taught early, though the chrono-particle procedure remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Frozen courtyard and ice violin constrain choice and charge the final image, with sensory detail selective and purposeful. However, per the global 9+ gate, capped at 8.8 because Q2 is not ≥9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (source of thoughts) escalates through J-7's agency in playing the violin and amalgamating timelines, with cost legible in the violin's dissolution and his transformed perception. One meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events—consciousness as a process, thoughts from amalgamated experience—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the image of sweeping as ordering the universe.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (J-7's composed, observational tone). No head-hopping; diction remains within the robot's lexicon, even at peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with good rhythm, but minor artifacts like "timelines seemed to loop" introduce slight vagueness. No major loops or scaffold issues; information density is high, though not flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of robot janitor, ice violin, and looped timelines feels organic and transformative. Risk-taking in blending sci-fi with lyrical mysticism, but per the global 9+ gate, capped at 8.8 because Q2 is not ≥9.0.</comment>
