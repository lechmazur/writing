<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Collective "we" POV provides a unified stance with clear motivation and credible endurance, but individual interiority and contradictory impulses are absent, limiting depth. The final choice to become gardeners is earned by the ghost's fading and the final message, with visible cost in lost guidance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly with because/therefore linkages from messages to actions to self-reliance. Closure is a decisive change (community takes over) with felt cost (ghost fades, responsibility assumed). Orientation is immediate, and the persistent constraint of maintaining the garden shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral: the orchard planet, floating arches, and butterfly garden constrain choices (ringing the bell, climbing the arch) and charge the final image of stewardship. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, woven through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collective hope and survival) escalates through ghost-led actions to the community's agency when messages fade. One meaningful tightening occurs as the ghost weakens, forcing self-reliance with visible cost (loss of guidance, ongoing labor).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of stewardship and earned hope emerges organically from events and images (bell, messages, nebula). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the community writing new messages, without moralizing or abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>First-person plural POV is stable and distinctive, with a lyrical, collective voice that modulates appropriately. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent, and purposeful elision (ghost's nature) pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with vivid imagery and rhythmic control. High information density, no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and supports pressure, especially in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of altruistic ghost, orchard planet, and collective effort feels organic and inevitable. The concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in world and character, with risk-taking (collective POV) that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
