<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prophet's motivation is clear and drives the story; her interiority is conveyed through specific perceptions like sketched resonance. However, she lacks contradictory impulses, which limits depth but fits the accumulative lens. Her final action is earned by prior beats, but the absence of internal conflict prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with a resonant reconfiguration closure; orientation is clear early. Cost is implicit in her lifelong compulsion but not explicitly visible at the ending, preventing a higher score. The closure lands effectively, though the cost proof test is only partially met.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and integral to the action; the floating orchard constrains and enables the prophet's work, charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven through action. However, the high-band cap applies due to Q2 not meeting the 9.0 threshold.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (orchestrating the grove); escalation is accumulative, building density until the final strike. Agency is consistent, but cost is subtle. The accumulative lens supports the deepening, though the absence of a more tangible cost limits the score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of transforming obstacles into art emerges organically from actions and images; subtext is rich without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the high-band cap applies due to Q2 not meeting the 9.0 threshold.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent; POV is stable with a strong perceptual signature (sketched resonance, cloud reading). No dialogue, but prose rhythm matches the mystical tone. The high-band cap applies due to Q2 not meeting the 9.0 threshold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with varied sentence structures and no scaffold or loops. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful; read-aloud rhythm is strong. The high-band cap applies due to Q2 not meeting the 9.0 threshold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and singular; the combination of elements feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure pays off with a unique vision. The high-band cap applies due to Q2 not meeting the 9.0 threshold.</comment>
