<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her observant trait; internal conflict is shown through her investigation and final choice to expose the truth, earned by prior causality with visible cost. Minor tell in interiority prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a decisive change with legible cost ("shake the family business"). Orientation is immediate, and proof by contradiction structures the plot effectively without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid setting with the observatory and pen nib charging the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, though the observatory's pressure on choices is slightly atmospheric rather than constraining.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency; the discovery of the manuscript forces a choice with unmistakable cost, breaking the cycle of regret under causal linkages. Dominant stake is well-signaled and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of legacy and truth emerges through particulars like orbits of regret and the pen nib; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though thematic echo in final paragraph slightly softens impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping or register drift. Elara's observant nature filters details consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied sentences and no loops; figurative language is consistent and supports clarity. Information density is high, and peak beats avoid muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of logic method with literary themes; specific choices like proof by contradiction and orbits of regret feel inevitable and heighten stakes. Risk-taking in structure pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
