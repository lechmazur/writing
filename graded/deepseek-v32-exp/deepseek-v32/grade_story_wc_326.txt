<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Leo's characterization is concrete, with his motivation sharpened by solitude and the heartbeat counter as a persistent constraint. His micro-choices under pressure reveal determination, and the final gesture with the shard is earned. The ghost's characterization through memories adds depth, and the relationship serves as a crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tight causal linkage from inciting incident to closure, with a decisive change (ghost's resolution and Leo's understanding) and felt cost in the hours of work and heartbeat count. Orientation is immediate, and the inferred causal lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The opal observatory under snow is an integral micro-setting that constrains action (projector, isolation) and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective, purposeful, and filtered through Leo's perception, creating a cohesive atmosphere of "midnight solace."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fetching wisdom before his end) escalates through Leo's agency in tracing the patterns. The heartbeat counter provides a ticking clock, and the cost is legible in the final realization, foreclosing other paths with visible effort.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges naturally from concrete actions and images—wisdom from failure, mortality, error. The final realization reweights prior material without moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the dried ink pattern and steady heartbeat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with a distinct lyrical voice that modulates with pressure. The ghost's dialogue carries subtext and advances the plot. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion supports the climactic beats, and the final lines are resonant without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story combines elements (death certificate error survivor, digital ghost, defragmentation via ink patterns) in a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the emotional truth is specific and grounded.</comment>
