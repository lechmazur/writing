<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Arin's interior contradiction between impatience and patience is concretely embodied in her vigilance and journey; her final choice to guide the magnetic field is earned by prior causality (moon tracking) with visible cost in the slow unyoking. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions filter through physical sensation and action. The single POV sustains a consistent hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages (moon paths → viaduct timing → intervention). Closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the yoke loosens "one moon path at a time," cost legible in the "smile, a small release of the wildness." Orientation is immediate; no elision or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting—basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, magnetic viaduct—constrains choice and charges the final image; the viaduct's wet gleam and magnetic hum are tactile, filtering through Arin's expertise. Sensory selection reflects urgency (teeth vibration, slick surface). Environment directly shapes tactics and outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unyoking her people) escalates through Arin's agency under the causal lens: her calculated journey and precise intervention at the viaduct narrow options and initiate disruption. Cost is felt in the "patient revolution" and her return trek "lighter" but with ongoing vigil. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of sculpting patience from impatience emerges through concrete events and images (moon tracks, magnetic guidance, frozen lake) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "true revolution is not seized, but grown, like ice over deep water." Subtext in restrained wildness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by Arin's horizon-mapping expertise; voice is lyrical yet precise, modulating with emotional intensity (e.g., "heart a steady drum"). No head-hopping; elision (moon-path calculations) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language ("restrained wildness," "patient revolution") is consistent and purposeful. Sentence propulsion accelerates with the viaduct sequence and breathes at closure. No artifacts obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of magnetic disruption, lunar tracking, and patient revolution feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in quiet, scientific activism heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth anchors the concept.</comment>
