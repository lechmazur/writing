<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation and interiority are vivid and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("bruised awe"). However, the scene lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; her resolve is steady, which limits the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing) with clear cost—the end of time as peaceful gift—and the puppet head as persistent constraint shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated and pressures choice; the lighthouse and "pane of hush" are essential, and the broken puppet head charges the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through density increase under the accumulative lens; cost is legible in the final dissolution, though agency is quiet and more textual than causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of flawed beauty and peaceful end emerges organically from concrete images; the final reconfiguration offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical, consistent POV with distinct perceptual signature; voice modulates purposefully, though the density of figurative language occasionally borders on overwrought.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dense, pattern-taught figurative language pays off at closure; sentences advance atmosphere and character, but some abstraction risks mild muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elements feels inevitable; the quiet, lullaby-ending is a singular risk that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
