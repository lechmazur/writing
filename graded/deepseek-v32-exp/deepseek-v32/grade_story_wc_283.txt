<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied in micro-choices, but internal contradiction is subtle; her defiance is steady, lacking impulsive struggle that would heighten tension. Final choice earned with visible cost in the hourglass reversal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with legible cost under a causal lens; orientation immediate; the cataloging method constrains tactics and shapes the decisive change, with the prophecy reshaped through earned causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The amber warehouse and echo jar create a vivid, constrained environment that charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, with objects like buttons directly shaping Elara's choices.</comment>
