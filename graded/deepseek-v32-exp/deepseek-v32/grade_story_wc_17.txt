<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, with the protagonist's sensitivity shown through concrete actions. The final choice to deactivate and document is earned by prior discoveries. However, interior emotion sometimes leans toward stated weight ("I felt the weight of their guilt") rather than fully embodied contradiction, and a hint of diagnostic label-speak appears in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from entry to discovery to deactivation; closure is a decisive change with visible cost ("the legacy's burden remained in my heart"). Orientation is anchored early, and the inferred Causal lens holds without ambiguity. The film negative is slightly convenient but does not break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage is vividly rendered with sensory detail and crucially constrains choice (the overgrown panel) and charges the final image. Some descriptions verge on the generic ("damp stone and decay"), but the setting actively shapes tactics and outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering truth and bearing responsibility escalates cleanly via protagonist agency—finding diaries, processing film, deactivating device. A meaningful tightening occurs as options narrow, and the cost is legible on the page in the final burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of responsibility and memory emerges organically from particulars; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer. A minor thematic echo occurs with the line "legacy's burden is not just memory, but responsibility," which states rather than fully trusts the image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature befitting the cartographer. Voice is lyrical and consistent, filtering description through professional sensitivity. No head-hopping or distance issues, though some abstraction briefly softens immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally vivid and purposeful with good rhythm. Minor artifacts include slight redundancy ("sensitively perceptive soul") and a few scaffold-like sentence stems. No loops or figurative muddle that harms closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The core concept of an echo cartographer in a post-climate-shift world is fresh and organically synthesized. The story commits fully, transforming familiar tropes through specific, grounded details and a non-obvious moral calculus about responsibility.</comment>
