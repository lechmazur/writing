<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Characterization is clear and consistent, but lacks internal conflict or change; Kael's cool-headedness is unwavering, which limits depth. The rail spike's transliteration provides concrete interiority, but emotions are labeled rather than fully embodied. No relationships or secondary characters to test him. Final choice is motivated but without personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot is causally coherent with a clear inciting incident and closure. The sleepwalking constellations trigger events, and Kael's actions lead logically to catching the echo. Cost is more environmental than personal, but closure lands decisively. Structure is tight, orientation immediate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly imagined and integral to conflict; the sound wave garden pressures choices and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven into action. The garden's transformation from feral to still provides atmospheric payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through garden's increasing chaos and predatory lullaby. Kael's agency drives escalation via zigzag, voicing silence, and spike use. Cost is legible in the garden's soothing, though personal cost is minimal. One meaningful tightening occurs at the lake's eruption.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from pursuit of divine echo through silence and patience. The final image of echo in starlight jar offers resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext exists in the value of quiet attention. No moralizing; ambiguity remains.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, voice is distinct and poetic, matching the fantastical setting. Prose rhythm is controlled, with no head-hopping. Perception is filtered through Kael's cool-headed perspective. No dialogue, so not applicable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical, with varied sentence structures and strong rhythm. Figurative language is consistent and pattern-taught. No obvious loops or scaffold; clarity maintained even in peak beats. Line-level craft supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High originality in concept: sound wave garden, emotion-transliterating spike, voicing silence. The synthesis feels organic and fresh. Risks are taken in worldbuilding and payoff. Transformation of familiar tropes through specific details.</comment>
