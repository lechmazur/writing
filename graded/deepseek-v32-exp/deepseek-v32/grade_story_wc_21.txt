<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies from preservation to truth-seeking; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion ("hand clutching at her chest"); final choice to rebuild is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a decisive change with felt cost (weight of truth); orientation is early; plot advances via because/therefore linkages with no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (zeppelin as prison, lagoon as key) and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (escape and truth) escalate through Elara's agency; cost is legible in the ending; one meaningful tightening under causal lens drives to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus sanitized history emerges from events; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext in diary reveal deepens meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is solemn and archival, rhythm controlled; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid with high information density; no loops or scaffolds; figurative language is purposeful and clear; rhythm supports pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognitive trap and archival mystery; specific details (debris messages, crystal diary) feel inevitable; risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
