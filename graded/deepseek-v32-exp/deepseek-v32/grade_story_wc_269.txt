<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kai's motivation is rooted in concrete memory ("coral bleaching witness"), and interiority is shown through embodied habits (tapping) and focused analysis. The final choice to draft a report is an Earned Stasis, foreclosing simple answers with a cost of responsibility. Minor deduction for a moment of diagnostic label-speak in the revelation ("understanding that the ban... had come too late").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the atlas page becomes a relic and the delayed ecological cascade is understood. Cost is legible on the page in the folded page and the "adrift and anchored" feeling. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of data leading to revelation is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is essential and constrains choice: the monitoring station confines the world to data streams and logs, and the atlas page as a micro-setting charges the final image. Sensory details ("ocean sighing," "station hummed") are selective, purposeful, and filtered through Kai's professional focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering why paths disappear) escalates under the accumulative lens through data correlation, culminating in the cascade revelation. Agency is in Kai's analysis and the decision to report. Cost is the acceptance of lost worlds and responsibility, felt in the final beats. One meaningful tightening is sufficient and well-executed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the concrete particulars of coral death, map analysis, and data patterns. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the folded atlas and the resolve to report. Slight edge toward explicit moral in "a warning against further delay," but it is earned by the preceding narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinctive, with a perceptual signature shaped by scientific observation and rhythmic patterning (tapping mirrors prose rhythm). Diction is consistent and voice-motivated; elision (like the specifics of the data) is purposeful and supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong information density and varied sentence structures. Minor quirk in the phrase "periodically eternal" feels slightly forced but is integrated. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; clarity and propulsion are maintained through to the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of climate consequence with a personal, meditative duty feels fresh and inevitable. The atlas page and the ecological cascade revelation transform a familiar premise through specific, grounded detail and a non-obvious moral calculus (responsibility anchored in understanding). Risk-taking in the accumulative, data-driven structure heightens stakes.</comment>
