<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied under pressure; contradictory impulses (panic vs. stillness) act in scene, and the final choice to use the hush and recall the glyphs is earned by prior causality with visible cost (empty vial, permanent silence). No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages; orientation is immediate; closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change with felt cost ("leaving a permanent silence in her soul"). The persistent constraint of dwindling air shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting and object (temple, vial) constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., "cold against her palm," "velvet quiet"), woven through action with clear spatial choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survival) signaled early; escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens (using hush, decoding glyphs under time pressure) with unmistakable cost on-page (dwindling air, spent hush). One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme (overriding instinct, harnessing the ephemeral) emerges through concrete events and images; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("saved by silence") without moralizing. Slight risk of overtness but remains earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt; voice has a distinct perceptual signature (lyrical, pressure-modulated) with rhythmic control; no head-hopping; purposeful elision (hush) taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise and vivid with high information density; no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle; sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs (e.g., short bursts during urgency, longer lines in memory sequences).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific (silence as substance for memory access); synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; details are particular and irreplaceable.</comment>
