<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's rationality and involuntary truthfulness are consistent, compelling traits that drive high-stakes choices and her final, rational decision to share the cure. Interiority is concrete ("a cool, weighty sphere") and her emotional progression from compulsion to guarded choice is earned. A slight deduction for interiority that occasionally nears diagnostic language ("psychological safety") but remains anchored in embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly: her truthfulness forces a dangerous bargain, leading to the ritual, which creates a buffer, enabling her to extend the cure. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the fragile, managed peace is legible with felt cost ("fragility of their safety"). Orientation is immediate and the cost is visible in the storm-battered rituals.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The hanging orchard and storms are not just backdrop; they supply the truffles for trade and are essential to charging the relic, directly constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("wind screamed," "nets of roots"), fully filtered through Elara's professional and survivalist POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (psychological safety) escalates cleanly: from personal need, to risky bargain, to ritual success, to the new complication of community attention and responsibility. Each tightening is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens. The cost—fragile, storm-dependent peace—is unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of managing fracture, not healing, emerges organically from the core concept and Elara's arc. The final image (the eye as "tool and testament") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext is rich in the "fractured grace" motif, avoiding moralizing. The ending's conceptual repricing—safety as a daily tended garden—lands with cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable, close third, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by rationality and precision. Voice is consistent and textured ("a practice of fractured grace"). Dialogue is absent, but internal narration is goal-driven and compressed under pressure. No head-hopping or unmotivated elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and generally precise with strong rhythm. Minor artifact: the phrase "fractured grace" is used twice, slightly nearing a thematic echo, but it doesn't obscure causality. Information density is high; sentences advance story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold that dull the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of post-empathy virus world, involuntary truthfulness, and a botanical/magical relic cure. The antique glass eye as a tool for "occlusion" is a specific, ingenious inflection. The concept is fully committed to and transformed through grounded, character-driven choices, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
