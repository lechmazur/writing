<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and drives the plot, with guilt embodied through specific memories and actions. However, interior contradictions are not deeply explored in scene; her drive is singular rather than simultaneously conflicted. The final integration of guilt is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with felt cost as guilt hushes into a manageable memory; causal lens holds tightly from motivation through tethering to resolution. Time folding as a constraint shapes tactics, and the ending reconfigures meaning without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the laboratory and amber object charging the final image and constraining choices. However, the environment is more atmospheric than actively pressuring beyond providing tools; sensory detail is selective but purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hushing guilt) escalates through time folding, forcing Elara's agency in tethering; one meaningful tightening occurs with the truth revelation. Cost is legible at closure, though escalation relies slightly on atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of integrating guilt emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in amber and constellations. The final line reweights prior material without moralizing, though it borders on explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is consistently poetic with distinct perceptual signature, and POV remains stable. However, ornate diction may slightly distance from immediacy under pressure; no dialogue to evaluate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density, but phrases like "meteor hush" risk figurative overload in peak beats. No loops or scaffold; clarity and propulsion are maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elements (constellation tattooist, haunted firmware, time folding) creates a memorable, inevitable-feeling concept. Risk-taking in lyrical-scientific blend heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
