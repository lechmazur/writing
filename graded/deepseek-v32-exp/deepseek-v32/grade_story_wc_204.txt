<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and singular, driving the plot with embodied emotion and earned final choice, but lacks contradictory impulses or internal conflict that would elevate to the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with tight because/therefore linkages; closure lands on-page with a decisive change and resonant reconfiguration, cost visible in the library's transformation and expended whisper.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices (frost on panes, glass branches) and charging the final image; sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated with POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under causal lens; cost is unmistakable in the destabilization and expended whisper, tightening stakes meaningfully to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from action and image, but a direct statement ("some systems needed destabilizing...") near the end slightly undercuts the earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical perceptual signature; voice remains consistent under pressure, and rhythmic control enhances the ethereal atmosphere.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without loops or scaffold; sentence-level propulsion and figurative language are controlled and serve the closure image flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh, specific synthesis of magical elements; risk-taking in lyrical abstraction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and turns feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
