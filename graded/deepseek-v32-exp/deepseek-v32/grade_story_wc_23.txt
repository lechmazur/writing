<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is concrete and rooted in grief; her micro-choices under pressure, such as adjusting the antenna based on the censer foot's warmth, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation—finding peace not in place—is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the cooling of the censer foot at dawn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in "she found her way home not in place, but in peace." The accumulative/textural lens holds via patterned imagery and moon-phase progression; the censer foot as a persistent constraint shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The starlit signal station and censer foot function as micro-settings that constrain choice (guiding antenna adjustments) and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Aris's POV, with the station's inert state mirroring internal loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigating loss) tightens through Aris's agency in building the antenna and receiving cryptic calls; escalation under the accumulative lens is via density increase and moon-cycle cadence. Cost is felt in her bruised comfort and the censer foot's stilled fluctuations at dawn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reverse migration and solace emerges through particulars like the censer foot and antenna construction, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—peace through traversing loss—reweighting prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical signature; voice modulates under pressure (e.g., "raw solace" and "bruised comfort"). Cryptic phone calls carry subtext and advance plot without head-hopping; perceptual selectivity is consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density with no paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language ("a needle stitching the sky") is pattern-taught and pays off at closure; rhythm accelerates with the moon's waxing and breathes at the dawn resolution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements synthesize organically: patchwork navigation, moon-phase attribute, and reverse migration offer a fresh angle on loss. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the censer foot's irreplaceability makes the story inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
