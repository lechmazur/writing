<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her lineage, and her synesthetic perception is concretely embodied. However, her internal state lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; she is single-minded in her duty without on-page conflict or blind spots, which limits depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly with a decisive closure: the sculpted hush shatters, wonder is released, and the amber sheet fades. The precise timing of the sculptor's chisel provides a tight because/therefore linkage, and cost is legible in the faded sheet and transformed cavern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ice cavern is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (light, color, sound) and functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice—the aurora's colors are essential to unlocking the hush. The final image of glowing ice charges the closure, meeting the 9+ quick test, but Q2's score caps this category at 8.8.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (releasing wonder) escalates via a live clock—the alignment with the sculptor's strike—forcing Elara's precise agency. The cost is visible in the faded music sheet and her fulfilled purpose, though the personal price is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme (wonder as essential) emerges organically through the ritual and the final generative release, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the linked sculptor and glowing cavern, but the theme is stated explicitly early, slightly reducing subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and voice is consistently lyrical, filtering perception through Elara's synesthesia. The prose rhythm modulates with pressure, and there is no head-hopping. However, the elevated diction occasionally flirts with overwriting without breaking clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with strong rhythmic control and varied syntax. No significant loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and coherent. Minor risk of abstraction ("oscillating repose") but clarity and momentum are maintained through the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of synesthetic bell-ringer, sculpted hush, and aurora alignment feels fresh and organic. Concept is fully committed and transformed through specific, grounded details. However, Q2's score caps this category at 8.8 per the 9+ gate.</comment>
