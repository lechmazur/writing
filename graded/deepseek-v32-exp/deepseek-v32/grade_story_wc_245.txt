<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elan's grief and hope are concretely embodied through sensory perception; his final earned stasis is motivated by prior causality with visible cost in the closure. Interiority is character-particular without diagnostic labels. Minor deduction for internal conflict being more implied than dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly; orientation is clear within 120 words; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (earned stasis) with felt cost on-page ("his grief settled into a quiet blaze of remembrance"). No causality breaks; the persistent constraint of his blindness shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is a tactile, ultrasonic forest that constrains every choice and charges the final image of the Stillpoint. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Elan's unique perception, avoiding visual cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant emotional stake is signaled early; escalation is driven by Elan's agency in following the trail and climbing the tree. One meaningful tightening (ring's warmth, note trail) leads to a closure where cost is legible in the emotional reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of grief and inner navigation emerges through particulars (compass ring, musical notes, Stillpoint) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the Stillpoint as a condition of the soul, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; voice has a distinct perceptual signature aligned with Elan's blindness and sensory absorption. Rhythmic control under pressure is assured, with no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful; sentence-level propulsion matches scene urgency. No artifacts obscure clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of blind mapmaker, ultrasonic forest, and emotional navigation feels inevitable; tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in sensory description heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
