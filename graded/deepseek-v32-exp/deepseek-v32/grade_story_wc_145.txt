<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, and Aris's dry wit surfaces in a wry final line, but interior conflict is minimal and the resolution lacks a strongly felt cost; his subtle confidence remains steady without being tested by contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean, orientation is immediate, and closure lands with a decisive change (finding the source) and resonant reconfiguration (worrying tranquility). Cost is legible but understated; the condensation pattern as a map is slightly convenient but integrated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the condensation pattern acting as a micro-setting that directly guides the protagonist's choice and charges the final image of the ice field; sensory details are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding river sources) is clear and escalates via the falcon's confirmation and the condensation map, driven by Aris's agency. However, the cost of the journey is underplayed, reducing the weight of the escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of convergence and transience emerges organically through the phrasebook, pattern, and final image of nascent rivers; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though it leans slightly toward neatness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (dry-witted, observant); voice remains consistent, and the muted dialogue fits character. No head-hopping or distance issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished, rhythmic, and dense, with no loops or scaffold; figurative language (condensation as tributaries) is clear and purposeful, and sentence variety supports momentum without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quest narrative with inventive elements (atlas editor, condensation map, polyglot phrasebook); specific details ground the concept, though the resolution is somewhat conventional.</comment>
