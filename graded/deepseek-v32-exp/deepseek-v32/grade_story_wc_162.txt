<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her father's legacy, with concrete interiority and earned change. However, internal conflict is minimal, and emotions lean poetic rather than deeply embodied under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elara understands sacred thresholds; causal lens holds tightly with weather codes and distances shaping tactics. Cost is legible in the shift from "fractured hush" to "soft hum."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—drifting prism terrace, wood grain—and actively constrains choices (necessary distances) and charges the final image with stabilized light. Sensory detail is selective and woven through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering why thresholds feel sacred) escalates through Elara's agency—decoding, intuiting, stepping through. Cost is conceptual but clear in the reconfiguration of her understanding and the world's harmony.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like grain analysis and weather codes, with subtext in convergence of chaos and order. Final paragraph states the theme explicitly but is earned by the journey.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, intuitive—and rhythmic control. No head-hopping; voice remains consistent and purposefully compressed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density, varied syntax, and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("featherly determined") is pattern-taught and clear, though slightly precious.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes butterfly effect, maze navigation, and weather codes into a fresh, organic whole. Specific details (prism terrace, logbook) and earned turns elevate without gimmickry.</comment>
