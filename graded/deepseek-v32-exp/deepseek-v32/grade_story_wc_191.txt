<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent, with earned final choice to guard rather than rule; lacks deep internal contradiction, but micro-choices under pressure reveal wisdom and nostalgia.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly; orientation early; closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost of renounced ambition; time constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory setting integrates with action—waterfall, orchard, and murals constrain choices and charge the final image; nano-pigments and synthetic trees reinforce tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find stairway before sunrise) escalates via agency under causal lens; cost legible in Arin’s guardianship renunciation, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of nostalgic preservation emerges organically from Arin’s actions and final image; no moralizing, offering resonant non-literal answer through guardianship choice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with poetic, lore-keeper perceptual signature; no head-hopping; voice modulates with pressure, though not exceptionally distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dense, rhythmic prose with high information density; no artifacts or loops; minor telling (e.g., "evoking nostalgia") but clarity and momentum maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Quest trope transformed by specific sci-fantasy details and thematic depth; synthesis feels inevitable, though risk-taking is moderate.</comment>
