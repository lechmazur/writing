<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices under pressure reveal dedication. However, internal contradiction is minimal, and the successful resolution lacks a visible, felt cost, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds; closure is a decisive change with the dream captured. Orientation is clear early. Cost is implied but not deeply dramatized, slightly reducing impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and integral: the fog, frost, and ruins pressure choices and charge the final image. The sextant and mirror function as micro-settings that constrain and enable the ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate with the tightening timeframe of the frost. Agency is strong, but the cost (risk of shattering) is told rather than viscerally felt, softening the tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of erasing boundaries emerges organically through action and image, culminating in a resonant, non-literal closure. Avoids moralizing; subtext is woven into the ritual and mirror.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and closely filtered through Elara's perception. Lyrical, descriptive voice is consistent and supports atmosphere; no head-hopping or dialogue artifacts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, rhythmic, and dense with purpose. No noticeable loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh, specific synthesis of dream-capturing ritual with mirror maker and broken sextant. Concept feels organic and inevitable; emotional truth is grounded in particular longing.</comment>
