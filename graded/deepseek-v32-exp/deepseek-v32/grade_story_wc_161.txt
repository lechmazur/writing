<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction (curator vs. fugitive) is concrete and drives micro-choices; her final surrender to trust is earned through the causality of collaboration. Minor reliance on metaphorical labels ("blooming withering") slightly edges toward diagnostic summary in peak beats, but the embodied cost of her cracked voice and the reconfiguration of the meteorite chip anchor the change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing (meteorite chip shifts from relic to keystone, isolation to foundation) with clear, felt cost in the image of the open door. Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant) lens holds; Jasper’s return triggers a because/therefore chain leading to partnership and the new composition. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The attic functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice (isolation, dust-mote ritual) and supplies the resources (ledgers, equipment) that affect the outcome. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara’s bias. The meteorite chip, as a recurring object, decisively charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (balance preservation vs. life) escalates through Elara’s agency: Jasper’s disruption forces her to engage Henry, and the project demands collaboration. Cost is legible in her “voice cracking from disuse” and the emotional risk of the new composition. One meaningful tightening (from isolation to invitation) under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (dust motes, paper trails, meteorite) without statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: preserving an echo means letting it change form. Subtext operates in gesture and silence (Henry’s kind nod, shared handling of brittle pages). No moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature ("blooming withering," "paper trails... were a foundation"). Voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven (Elara’s request, Henry’s nod). No unmotivated elision or distance shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, advancing character and atmosphere simultaneously. Rhythm varies purposefully; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Minor risk of overwriting in phrases like "blooming withering" is contained and pattern-taught. Closure image is clear and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of carrier pigeons, Mars meteorite, and attic curation feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth is specific, not generic. Risk-taking in lyrical density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through grounded character choices and a coherent artistic stance.</comment>
