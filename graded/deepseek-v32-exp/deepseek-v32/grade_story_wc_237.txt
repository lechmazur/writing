<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied; her internal conflict and micro-choices under pressure (holding breath, steady hand) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost (burning lungs). Final transformation earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise: crystalized stories gleam as storm breaks; cost legible in burning lungs. Accumulative lens holds; persistent constraint (held breath) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (floating platform, storm) constrains choice and charges final image; sensory details (cool sting, frost forming) are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes (transforming scars) escalate via protagonist's agency under accumulative pressure; cost unmistakable in physical strain and approaching storm, forcing a meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of alchemizing pain into resilience emerges through specific events (scar crystallization) and superstitions; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature ("saturated hush"); lyrical rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language ("runes spreading like frost flowers") serves clarity; no loops, scaffold, or register drift in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ritual magic and personal healing; specific details (crow quill, moonstone ink) feel inevitable; risk-taking in internal climax heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
