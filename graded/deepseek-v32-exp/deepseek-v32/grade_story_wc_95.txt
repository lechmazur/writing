<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Alistair's motivation is concrete and drives choices; interiority is embodied via the needle card and sundial. The shift from duel to joint departure is earned by prior causality (decoded message, dropped token) with visible cost (foregoing the duel's resolution). Elara's presence and their history add relational pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds; closure is a decisive change (abandon duel, depart together) with cost legible in the foregone conflict and reconfigured partnership. Orientation is clear early; the sundial's code and needle card provide tight linkages. Minor hairline slip: cost could be more deeply felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective (atrium, brook, sundial). The sundial as micro-setting constrains choice and charges the final image (coordinates). Sensory details are filtered through Alistair's perception. Spatial choreography is clean, though the glass atrium itself is less active in pressuring choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (right to map the question) escalates via duel, then pivots when the needle card falls; agency drives the shift (Alistair reveals coordinates). Cost is legible in the abandonment of the duel for a shared journey. One meaningful tightening suffices under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (turning questions into destinations) emerges through action and image, not statement. The hidden overture and needle card provide subtext; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via joint departure. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV (Alistair) is stable; voice is consistent, reflective, and suited to a philosopher. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven. Perceptual signature is distinct (noticing angles, tactile details). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with varied syntax and rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Information density is high (e.g., sundial calculation, fencing motions). Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene pressure. No artifacts that harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of philosopher-duelist, mechanical arm, coded sundial, and shift from conflict to collaboration feels organic and inevitable. Specific details (needle card, half-painted sundial) avoid template plots. Risk-taking in quiet resolution heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
