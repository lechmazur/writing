<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Keeper's motivation is clear and rooted in scars; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion; change from isolation to connection is earned via on-page causality and cost. Slight abstraction in the lesson's phrasing ("teach suffocating to breathe") is balanced by dramatized action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate; closure is a decisive change (threshold stabilized, keeper shifts from burning to building bridges) with legible cost—the risk of linking and the forfeit of solitary vigil.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: the charcoal door, thin air, and starlight constrain choice and charge the final image (door now "waiting to be knocked"). Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teaching breathing, protecting sanctuary) escalates under causal pressure; keeper's agency (linking with the presence) narrows options and carries cost—possible loss of her sanctuary connection. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of connection through scars emerges organically from events and images; subtext operates in gesture (extending scarred palm) and final reconfiguration (building bridges from scars). No moralizing, but the lesson is slightly explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, somber perceptual signature. Voice modulates with pressure; the presence's vibration is effectively rendered. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures and no loops or scaffolding. Figurative language ("eyes like dead stars") is consistent and purposeful; closure image is clear and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and specific; the synthesis of burning bridges, linking scars, and a fading threshold feels inevitable. Risk-taking (lyrical abstraction) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; emotional truth anchors originality.</comment>
