<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear and consistent, and his gentle meticulousness is shown through specific actions. However, interiority leans toward abstract telling rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; the realization is earned but lacks a visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly; orientation is immediate. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (discovery that illusions carry intentional vows) with clear conceptual cost, though the felt price is more intellectual than emotional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The frozen library is vividly rendered through sensory detail and actively constrains choice (fading illusions, cold quiet). The setting charges the final image and is indispensable to the story's logic and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving fading illusions) is clear; escalation occurs via Aris's agency in discovering the embedded vow. Pressure is coherent but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of preserving meaning from transience emerges organically through concrete actions and images. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—Aris becomes a participant, not just an archivist—without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and voice is distinct: lyrical, precise, and perfectly matched to the character and setting. Rhythmic control and perceptual signature are exceptional, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished, dense, and rhythmically varied with zero scaffold or loops. Figurative language is precise and purposeful; sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive. Line-level craft is publishable.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and synthesis of elements (frozen library, frequency sampling, luminous vows) feels organic and inevitable. The story commits fully to its concept, avoiding cliché and offering a specific, memorable perspective.</comment>
