<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular (bonsai mindset filtering perception); motivation clear and intensifies through confession; final peace earned by prior causality with visible cost ("severance not mended"). Contradictory impulses (placidity vs. ache) act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing) with felt cost on-page ("a path through it had been charted"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of objects and reflection; orientation anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory detail vivid and purposeful (wet stone, salt, lace texture); micro-setting (compass, lace) charges final image; POV bias clear (bonsai tutor's perception). However, the islet setting is atmospheric rather than constraining choice, preventing a 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding apology) escalates via protagonist agency (speaking through lace) under Accumulative lens; cost legible in closure (peace integrated but severance not mended); one meaningful tightening through confession.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of regret and transformation emerges organically from objects and confession; subtext in lace pattern and compass response; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer (cerulean light as beginning) without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable and apt; voice distinct (slow, deliberate rhythm mirrors character); perceptual signature consistent (bonsai tutor's worldview); no head-hopping; elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic control and high information density; figurative language ("cerulean regret") is consistent and purposeful; no loops, scaffold, or register drift; clarity maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief, bonsai, maritime objects, and lace pattern feels organic and inevitable; tropes transformed through specific detail; risk-taking with symbolic objects heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
