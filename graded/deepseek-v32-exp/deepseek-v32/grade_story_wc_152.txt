<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to unravel the conspiracy through embroidery. Her interiority is concrete via actions like humming off-key and using the candle, but lacks deep contradictory impulses in scene, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost (disaster averted, candle's approval), and causal lens holds tightly from her stitching to delivering the tapestry. Orientation is immediate, and the adjacency method integrates seamlessly without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposeful; the eternal candle constrains choice and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ test. The observatory's atmosphere supports tension without overwhelming momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preventing coup) escalates under causal lens via Elara's agency, with cost legible in the risk of exposure. Pressure tightens meaningfully as time runs out, driving to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom disguised as foolishness emerges through action and image, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the tapestry, reweighting preservation over power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice reflective of Elara's perception. No head-hopping; prose rhythm and selective attention enhance pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and polished, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language serves character and atmosphere, and sentence-level propulsion supports the story's causal drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of embroidery, conspiracy, and adjacent possibilities feels inevitable. Risk-taking in magical realism heightens stakes without gimmickry, and execution is fully integrated.</comment>
