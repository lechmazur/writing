<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and drives the plot; interiority is embodied through actions like touching the valve and mapping points. However, lacking strong contradictory impulses in scene prevents a higher score, though her final choice is earned with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration: the ghostly lattice proves their past harmony, reconfiguring emptiness into a diagram. Cost is legible in Elara's eased heart and the valve's warmth. Accumulative lens holds throughout, with the valve as a persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful; the harbor and objects like the valve constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, such as the rain-slicked quays and salt-corroded case.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency following the valve's pull and using vials. Cost is visible in her feverish work and the adaptation from broken trumpet to lattice map. Stakes tighten meaningfully under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from fragments and absences; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the lattice map, showing belonging without moralizing. Subtext is in gestures and images, earned through specifics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature focuses on memory and absence. No head-hopping; prose reflects Elara's mindset, with controlled rhythm and elision taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density; rhythmic variation supports momentum. No loops or scaffold issues; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, as in "navigated absences."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise with unique synthesis of memory-spray and reactive vision; tropes transformed through specific choices. Risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the turn to mapping lattice feels inevitable.</comment>
