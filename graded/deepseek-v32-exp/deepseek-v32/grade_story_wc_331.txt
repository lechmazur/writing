<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal chain from ritual to vision is clean; closure delivers a conceptual repricing with legible cost. Orientation immediate. Hyperbolic geometry constraint shapes the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Library and hyperbolic nook are vividly rendered and essential to the ritual. The scarf and compass constrain choice and charge the final image. Specificity is high and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and escalated through the ritual. Agency is present, but conflict is internal and low-tension. Cost is conceptual, unmistakable but not deeply felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of stories as curvature emerges organically from imagery and action. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Integration is seamless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Synthesis of scientific poetry, analog memories, and hyperbolic geometry is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Concept is fully committed, transforming familiar tropes.</comment>
