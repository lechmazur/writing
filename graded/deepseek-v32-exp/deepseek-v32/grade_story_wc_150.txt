<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Leila's motivation is clear and her interiority concrete, with micro-choices under pressure. The final shift to understanding is earned, though internal conflict is subtle rather than contradictory; her "warmly curious nature" sustains reverence without deep struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing with legible cost in the final image of bones singing through trees; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, and the elder's advice sets a pattern that pays off in guided discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly rendered and actively constrains choices, charging the final image; the bone-and-root micro-setting is indispensable to the epiphany and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are internal and escalation is accumulative; Leila's agency in rebuilding the sundial leads to a reconfiguration of understanding, though the cost is conceptual—a gain of faith—rather than a tangible forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions; the final image offers a non-literal, resonant answer to the central question of journeys and faith, avoiding moralizing while reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature ("cautious enchantment," "air felt thick with interrupted journeys") is strong and rhythm controlled throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and polished, with no artifacts or loops; figurative language is precise and supports the accumulative drive, and sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with the beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of diaspora return, ancestral bones, and cyclical time feels fresh and inevitable; the concept is transformed through specific, grounded details, and the closure reconfigures familiarity into a singular artistic stance.</comment>
