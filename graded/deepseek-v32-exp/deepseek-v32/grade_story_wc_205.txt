<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is rich, with her poetic inclination and revolutionary past informing a consistent motivation. The final clarity is earned through the ritual and storm, though contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in the scene, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with visible cost (aged reflection). The accumulative/textural lens holds, and the persistent constraint of visible time shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid and visible time are integral, constraining choice (the storm prompts the ritual) and charging the final image of the shard. Setting is woven into action and perception with vivid specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (academic dispute), and pressure escalates through the brewing storm and Elara's agency in covering the mirror. Cost is legible in her aged reflection and the burnished sorrow she embraces.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transient beauty and intimate dance with time emerges through concrete images (vase, mirror, storm) and Elara's epiphany. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and voice is poetically reflective, matching Elara's character. Perceptual signature is distinct, with no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied rhythm, high information density, and no significant loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though slightly ornate in places.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of visible time, archaeological dispute, and mirror ritual feels inevitable in hindsight. The concept is fresh and emotionally specific, transforming familiar tropes.</comment>
