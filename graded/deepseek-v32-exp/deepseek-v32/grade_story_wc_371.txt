<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistently drives her actions; her relationship with Aris deepens under pressure, and her final choice is earned. However, internal contradictions are not heavily emphasized, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with visible cost; causal lens holds tightly from setup to ending, and the persistent constraint of the city's threat shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The secret tea house and overgrown courtyard constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details are selective, purposeful, and woven through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency; the official's arrival forces a meaningful tightening, and the cost is legible in the fragile, tenuous victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images and actions; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, anchored in the seedling and bread.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that reflects Elara's noticing; dialogue is natural and advances plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold; figurative language is clear and purposeful, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements feels fresh and inevitable; the concept of tenuous absolution and guerrilla gardening as resistance is original and fully integrated.</comment>
