<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elrin's motivation is clear and consistent, with a quiet enthusiasm that fuels his actions, but his internal contradiction (stellar doubt) is stated rather than deeply embodied, and some diagnostic language slightly reduces the impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly; closure is a decisive change (amber cracking, reawakening) with on-page cost. Orientation is immediate, and the plot progresses through because/therefore linkages without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck is vividly rendered and actively constrains choice, serving as both prison and catalyst; its transformation at the climax charges the final image with tangible cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elrin's agency—each interpretation deepens his understanding, culminating in the decision to act. The cost (breaking stagnation) is legible on the page and tightens the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the backwards prophecy and Elrin's arc, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer. Some abstract phrasing ("wavelength align") leans toward prompt-language but doesn't moralize.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical-scientific voice; perceptual signature is clear and consistent. No head-hopping, and the prose rhythm supports the contemplative yet urgent tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong propulsion and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though a slight abstraction in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of backwards prophecy, static bursts, and cosmic stagnation feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical abstraction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure is fully committed.</comment>
