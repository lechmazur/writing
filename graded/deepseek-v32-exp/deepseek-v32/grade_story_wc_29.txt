<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's "cautious hope" is a consistent, embodied trait that drives her covert interference and final stance. Interiority is concrete (e.g., "hope tightening into a knot"), and her final choice to propose unity is earned by the preceding causality of her experiment and its revelation. A minor reliance on told hope early prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clean causal structure with a strong Conceptual Repricing at closure: the realization that the cosmic entities are "reflectors" reweights the premise, revealing the internal divisions as the true conflict. Orientation is immediate, lens (Causal) holds, and cost is legible in Elara's decision to bridge the chasm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The radio station and astronomical charts are integral, tactile micro-settings that constrain choice (calibrating equipment, mapping signals) and powerfully charge the final image as "diagrams of human conflict." Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's professional focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (preventing a catastrophic choice) are clear and escalate through Elara's active interference. The response from the entities tightens the conflict, forcing a higher-stakes realization and a new tactical goal (proposing unity). Cost is visible in the foreclosed option of simple counter-signals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the plot: the cosmos reflects human division. The subtextual message "You outwit yourselves" avoids moralizing, and the final image reweights all prior material without stating a thesis. The integration of concept and character arc is seamless.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable, close third-person POV with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "a voice like grinding starlight"). The voice transmission functions as crisp, goal-driven dialogue. Minor register elevation ("ethereal grit") is consistent and does not break focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally vivid and propelled, with strong rhythmic control. A slight tendency toward synonym churn ("cautiously hopeful," "divided community") and one slightly strained metaphor ("grinding starlight") are minor artifacts that do not harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a first-contact premise with the psychological insight that external "tricksters" mirror internal divisions is fresh and specific. The concept is fully committed to and transforms familiar tropes through grounded character choices and a resonant, inevitable-feeling closure.</comment>
