<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values. However, interiority is more poetic than concretely embodied, and the lack of contradictory impulses or genuine flaws limits the depth of characterization under stress, though the final acceptance is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (accepting darkness). Orientation is immediate, and the taught pattern pays off. Slight deduction for a simplistic causal chain, but closure lands with legible cost under the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice (the void, cluster) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through POV, though occasional abstraction slightly distances immediacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear; escalation occurs via the void anomaly, forcing a tactical choice that deepens thematic understanding. Cost is conceptual but legible in the final acceptance. Agency drives the tightening under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through imagery and event, resisting direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Some abstraction prevents a higher score, but complexity is well integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic perceptual signature. Voice is consistent and rhythmically controlled, though the elevated register risks monotony. No head-hopping; elision is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and generally clear, but exhibits some overwriting and repetitive motifs (e.g., "quiet sigh of falling petals"). While patterned, the density of figurative language occasionally slows momentum without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Combines familiar elements into a fresh, organic synthesis with a memorable perspective. Risk-taking in style supports stakes without gimmickry. The core premise of sharing light without fire feels specific and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
