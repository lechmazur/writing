<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Leo's motivation is clear and rooted in trait; interiority is concrete through actions like playing "private thoughts." The final choice to play negative space is earned by prior listening, with cost in the transformation of silence. No contradictory impulses in scene, but emotional embodiment is slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with cost (crystal dims, heartbeat syncs), under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early; structure moves from atrium to grotto with one meaningful tightening. The persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting vividly constrains choice: the prism atrium and radiant grotto pressure Leo's actions. Sensory details like "dewdrops as tiny lenses" are selective and purposeful, charging the final image of internalized calm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hushing prophecy) escalates via accelerating code and thrumming; Leo's agency in playing negative space narrows options. Cost is legible in the crystal's transformation and earned silence. One meaningful deepening under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence vs. noise emerges through particulars like negative space and whispering; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in "eerie nostalgia" reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (focus on intervals and silence). Voice is poetic yet controlled; no head-hopping. Elision of negative space is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density with rhythmic control; no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language like "vested hush" is consistent and purposeful, especially in peak beats without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of silence, prophecy, and saxophone feels inevitable; risk-taking in abstract concepts heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details like crystal spire transform familiar tropes.</comment>
