<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation clear and interiority concrete, but character remains somewhat symbolic; final choice earned but lacks deeply felt personal cost in micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with legible cost; accumulative/textural lens held; orientation early and clear; one meaningful tightening via ascent and repeated time pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting vividly specific and constrains choice (spiral path, narrow door); lighthouse prison charges final image; sensory detail selective and purposeful, fully integrated with POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chasing hush) escalates under accumulative lens via density and pattern; time pressure tightens; cost legible but abstract, lacking visceral external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of legacy and truth emerges organically from images and events; subtext rich; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable; voice distinct, poetic, and consistent; occasional abstraction risks clarity but maintains perceptual signature and rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose dense and lyrical with high information density; pattern-taught repetition effective; minor overwriting in metaphors but no loops or scaffold harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transformative extension of fable with fresh synthesis; original setting and concept; risk-taking in style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
