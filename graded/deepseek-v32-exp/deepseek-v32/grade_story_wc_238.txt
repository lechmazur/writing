<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and personal; interiority concrete with embodied emotion like tears in dust. Final apology earned with visible cost, though contradictory impulses in scene are subtle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost (tears, lightness). Accumulative lens holds from start; orientation clear early with hush and archive; constraint of bottle and method shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting vivid with sensory details (aging paper, ozone); perfume bottle as micro-setting charges final image and constrains choice during exorcism, integral to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes of apology escalate through induced currents and vision; agency drives escalation under accumulative lens with cost legible in emotional confession and shifted memory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory and shame emerges through metaphor and image; ending offers non-literal resolution with melody and lightness, resisting moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature selective (e.g., "ethereal grit"), consistent under pressure; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of gossip-column exorcist and imperfect miracles; specific details like perfume bottle and sheet music archive feel inevitable, with emotional truth.</comment>
