<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Leo's reticence and warm observation are consistently embodied through precise action (careful stone stacking, observing starlight). His motivation to "bottle safety" escalates credibly from courier to active participant, culminating in a final choice (leaving the bottled light) that is a clear, cost-bearing renunciation. The ghost functions as a secondary pressure source, but Leo's internal arc—from silent observer to proactive protector—is the earned, dominant change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Leo's act of bottling safety transforms the tower's haunting into a protected stillness, a decisive shift achieved through his focused attention. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure builds via textured layers (failed light, letter, cairn, ghost's note) to a cadence shift where attention becomes action. The cost is legible in the final image: the beam remains dark, a permanent change, but the tower "seemed to hold a light from within."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is a crucible: the haunted lantern room's "pressure of lonely vigilance" directly shapes Leo's method of reply (stone stacking) and his ultimate action (bottling safety). Sensory details are filtered through Leo's professional, observant POV ("cold iron rail," "salt wind," "luminescent ache"). The sea glass and stones function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image, their reprise essential to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving safety/fragile peace) is signaled early. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is a clear deepening: the ghost's note redefines the problem (fading strength, not fault), which in turn redefines Leo's agency from passive courier to active consoler. The cost is the beam's permanent darkening, a traded-off consequence for achieving a deeper, more enduring peace. Agency drives every turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (solitude, duty, and the transmission of comfort) emerges organically from the letter chain, stone cairns, and Leo's final act. The "bottled safety" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to sustain isolated watchers. Subtext is rich in gestures (the stacked stones, the placed sea glass). The final image reweights prior material—the "luminescent ache" becomes "beautiful and sorrowful for the peace now won."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable, close-third, filtered through Leo's "warmly observant" perception, which dictates a selective, tactile vocabulary. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture ("luminescent ache," "hollow groan of the wind") that modulates effectively with pressure—calm description gives way to more charged, compressed phrasing during the bottling act. No head-hopping; psychic distance is expertly controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is densely poetic and consistently purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Occasional near-redundancy ("a glow that seemed to mourn the coming dark" follows "the air holding a luminescent ache") creates a slight echo but does not stall momentum. Figurative language is coherent and character-appropriate. The final paragraph's cadence is masterful, landing the closure image with clarity and resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of haunted lighthouse, anonymous letter chain, and stone-stacking communication feels fresh and organically integrated. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices: the "haunting" is redefined as weary duty, and the resolution is achieved through empathetic attention rather than exorcism. The emotional specificity of "bottling a feeling" avoids genre cliché, creating a memorable, authentic stance.</comment>
