<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and drives investigation, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. However, the epiphany, while earned, lacks visible cost or contradictory impulses in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a resonant Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in the final pulse. Orientation is immediate, structure fits single-scene defaults, and the feather's constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Underwater setting is vividly sensory and pressures choice, charging the final image with bioluminescent bloom. Capped due to Q2 not ≥9.0, though environment indispensably shapes the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (belonging) are signaled early; escalation via accumulative density leads to a deepening realization driven by Elara's agency. Cost is legible in the reconfigured understanding, though not a tightening of options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through feather and bloom, but the final paragraph's explicit thesis statement ("belonging was not about fitting in...") constitutes a thematic echo, triggering a penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is consistently poetic and observant, mirroring Elara's astrologer mindset. No head-hopping or distance issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished with varied rhythm and high information density. Some ornate phrasing is voice-motivated; no loops or scaffold artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of landscape astrology, underwater city, and bioluminescent bloom feels fresh and inevitable. Capped due to Q2 not ≥9.0, though risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
