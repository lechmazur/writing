<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and rooted in his friendship with Leo; his internal conflict between molting and finding an anchor is embodied in his actions. The final choice to rebuild is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a charged poise with cost (the empty tin, new steadiness). Orientation is clear early, structure tight, and the persistent constraint of molting shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rusted library is vividly rendered and constrains choice; the moonlit atmosphere charges the final image with luminous fracture, making setting indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (forging beauty from anarchy); escalation is driven by Silas's agency as he works against his transient nature, with cost felt in the emptied tin and shed self.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of blooming resistance emerges through concrete actions and images; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is poetic and consistent, with stable POV and rhythmic control; no head-hopping, and the perceptual signature is distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid, with varied syntax and no artifacts; every sentence advances story or atmosphere, and figurative language is coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original concept (vagrant poet who molts personalities) is fresh and integrated; lyrical risks heighten stakes without obscuring clarity, and the synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
