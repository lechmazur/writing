<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The weaver's interior contradiction (trapped by recursion yet compelled to weave) is concretely embodied, and his final renunciation of bearing burdens in favor of mapping them is earned through on-page micro-choices like lamp alignment. The cost is felt in the "whalebone reverie—resilient, bowed, and enduring," though the emotional resolution leans slightly conceptual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the weaver finds his place within the infinite. The cost of enduring recursion is legible in the final image of leaving the grotto "carrying no burdens, only the knowledge." Orientation is immediate, and the turn via lamp alignment provides a meaningful cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The bronze grotto and starlight are vividly filtered through the weaver's perception, and the kerosene lamp burner actively constrains choice by enabling the pivotal alignment. Sensory selection ("shingled hush," "cold gleam") deepens atmosphere, and the setting charges the final image of "a cathedral of fractured light."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through density of pattern (burdens branching) until the weaver's agency—aligning the lamp—reorients his stance. The cost is the release of burdens as tangible weights, made legible in the shift from "boundary-lessly trapped" to purposeful mapping. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete weaving acts; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer (mapping contours vs. bearing burdens) without moralizing. Subtext operates through motif recurrence (calcify, orient) that reweights at closure. Avoids prompt-like statement, though the abstract lexicon flirts with thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV maintains a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, fractal-aware diction ("shingled hush," "whalebone reverie") that reflects the weaver's mindset. Voice remains consistent under pressure, with purposeful compression in peak beats. No head-hopping; psychic distance is stable and apt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("flame a steady, gutting eye") is consistent and voice-motivated. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene cadence; no muddle in peak beats. Minor risk of overwriting is mitigated by pattern-teaching.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of fractal weaving, burden-collecting, and bronze grotto alchemy feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. Risk-taking in abstract concepts heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure image is uniquely charged.</comment>
