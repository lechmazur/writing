<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in preservation; interiority is concrete with embodied contradiction ("furiously tranquil"). Final embrace of responsibility earned by prior causality, cost visible in "the burden of the seed saver." Satisfies 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (learning texture of borrowed time) with cost legible in "cost of inheritance." Orientation clear early; hybrid lens (causal dominant) holds. Vortex inheritance constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Icebound atrium is vividly specific, sensory details woven into action; setting pressures choices (ice cracks) and charges final image. Micro-setting constrains ritual alignment, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering borrowed time's texture escalates through Elara's agency in ritual; cost unmistakable as vortex concentrates chaos elsewhere. One meaningful tightening under causal lens with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through seed/vortex imagery; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in granular texture of time and grandmother's quote enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature reflects Elara's worldview. Rhythm controlled under pressure, no head-hopping; elision taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density, varied syntax, and clear propulsion. No loops or scaffold; figurative language ("granular like sand") enhances clarity without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seed saving, vortex inheritance, and entropy feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in mystical concepts heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; emotional specificity anchors originality.</comment>
