<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear and drives the plot; her final lie is a credible endurance with visible cost ("physical weight in her chest"). Interiority is concrete, though early phrases like "philosophical itch" lean slightly abstract. The confrontation with Kael shows contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost in the final image of her hidden cache and "brightly attentive silence." Orientation is immediate; the pattern-to-truth progression tightens with purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The archive setting pressures choices and enables discovery; the patch and poem charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("digital necropolis," "cold corridors"), though some phrases edge toward generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. survival) escalates through Aris's agency; the confrontation with Kael forces a lie that narrows options and carries palpable cost. Pressure tightens coherently under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (the patch, the poem, the hidden cache); the final line offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights memory and deletion without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Aris's perception; voice is consistent with a slight technical lyricism. Dialogue is minimal but functional. No head-hopping or distance issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive with strong imagery; minor clichés ("mind screaming") and abstract phrases ("philosophical itch") prevent a higher score. No loops or scaffold artifacts; rhythm supports pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes memory, corporate cover-up, and personal ethics with freshness; the quiet ending and the concept of "keepers who remember" feel inevitable and risk-enhancing. Specific details anchor originality.</comment>
