<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to defy conformity is clear and intensifies through meticulous action. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with the final dance earned by prior causality and visible cost in the transformed snow. The "chaste courtesan" discipline and its unraveling show contradictory impulses in scene, not summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly; orientation is immediate. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the permanent silver sheen and the Lord Protector's arrested reaction. The prism sanctuary and threads constrain tactics and shape the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is selectively vivid and purposeful, with the silver courtyard and prism sanctuary constraining choice and charging the closure. Sensory detail reflects POV bias; the snow's transformation after the dance is a micro-setting shift that alters the story's world with felt cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defying conformity) escalates through Elara's agency: untangling threads then dancing. A single meaningful tightening—the dance reweights options and cost is unmistakable in the altered courtyard and the Lord Protector's witness. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of suppressed expression versus conformity emerges through specific images and actions, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the silver-sheened snow and whispering wind, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature filtered through Elara's artistry. Rhythmic control heightens pressure; purposeful elision (e.g., "alarming serenity") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; figurative language is pattern-taught and supports closure. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the dance and settles in the aftermath.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "chaste courtesan," echo-harvest, and thread-unraveling feels inevitable and organic. Risk-taking in lyric, accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded detail and charged closure.</comment>
