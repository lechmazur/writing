<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aria's characterization is concrete and embodied, with somatic details and internal contradiction acting in scene. Her motivation to anchor optimism in realism compels micro-choices under pressure, and her final cultivation of stillness is earned by prior causality with visible cost (weariness, growth). No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are filtered through specific perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise) as Aria forges a peace that embraces both love and loss, with cost legible in "residue of weariness" and "fragile but real." Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout; orientation is clear early, and the pattern of healing tightens to a decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The arboretum and seaside cliff function as micro-setting that constrains choice (training ground) and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered; recurring objects (photograph, bonsai) integrate into action and theme, avoiding postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal peace) escalates through agency-driven pressure: Aria uses somatic markers to ground herself during the storm, achieving a meaningful tightening. Cost is visible in weariness and the effort to cultivate stillness, under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of finding hope amidst pain emerges through particulars (photograph, somatic work) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the image of cultivating the "pearl of stillness," reweighting prior material with earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature focused on somatic and sensory details. Voice modulates with emotional intensity; compression (e.g., "froze," "guided") is purposeful under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high information density; rhythm varies naturally (e.g., short sentences during panic). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; line-level craft supports closure without obscuring causality or cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of trauma recovery with arboretum setting feels fresh and inevitable. Trope of survivor is transformed through somatic markers and specific lived detail; risk-taking in quiet, internal conflict heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
