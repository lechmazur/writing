<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kael's guilt and quest are embodied through concrete actions and micro-choices; his final acceptance is earned by prior causality with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; interior contradiction is shown in his profession versus his search for truth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost on-page ("heavy, mournful acceptance"). Orientation is clear early, and the clue-to-reveal chain is motivated, not coincidental.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (e.g., "sieved hush," "cobalt terrace") reflect POV bias. The watch hand as a recurring object charges the final image, and settings pressure choices (shore search, terrace return).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering truth) escalates through Kael's agency under causal lens; cost is legible in the ending's emotional weight. No coincidental resolution; turns narrow options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus fabrication emerges through particulars; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer, though the line "weight of a withheld truth..." leans slightly explicit without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and voice is distinct ("genealogist of the shadows"); perceptual signature is consistent, and dialogue (though minimal) is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful, even in peak beats, never obscuring clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise (black-market genealogist) is transformed through specific character and stakes; synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in concept heightens meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
