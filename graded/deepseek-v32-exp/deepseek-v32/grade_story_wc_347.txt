<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear and driving, interiority concrete, but internal contradiction (reluctance vs. duty) is stated rather than vividly acted out in scene; competence high without genuine struggle, yet final change earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) and felt cost; causal lens holds with persistent frost constraint; orientation anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail; setting (labyrinth, birds, nut) pressures choices and charges final image; nut as micro-setting constrains tactics and echoes in closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide before frost) escalates via time pressure; protagonist agency drives all turns; cost legible in her urgent actions and final peace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of legacy and guidance emerges implicitly through images (nut, blueprint, impressions); final image of "graceless beauty" offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice lyrical yet precise, modulating with urgency; dialogue minimal but natural; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density, varied rhythm, and clarity; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar tropes (caretaker, labyrinth) through specific details (cursed orchard, mechanical birds); emotional truth and risk-taking in quiet, internal arc; feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
