<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies, driving key choices; interiority is concrete though occasionally abstract ("reef-shadow joy"). The relationship with Corvin acts as a crucible, and her final earned stasis (insomnia waning, legacy secured) carries cost. Minor tell-dominant moments ("shyly unstoppable") prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; mosaic structure with multiple shards taught early and transitions legible. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the legend endures, with cost legible in the transformation of Elara's pain and solitude. No causality breaks; time jumps serve the pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (gargantuan shell) is integral, constraining choice (acoustics for lullabies) and charging the final image. Sensory details are vivid, selective, and filtered through Elara's poetic POV. Micro-setting (postcard, moss-lined niche) functions as "setting" and deepens atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transforming pain into beauty) escalates via agency: the returned singing, Corvin's challenge, and the spread of the philosophy. Under the accumulative lens, density increases reweight the stake. Cost is visible in Elara's solitude and her insomnia waning, though the final cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (photosynthesizing pain into beauty, blossom armistice) emerges organically from images and events, not statement. Subtext operates in the postcard's hidden message and the wind-carried lullabies. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though one line ("Beauty is a battle...") nears thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is third-person limited to Elara with stable, lyrical voice; perceptual signature is distinct (poetic, noticing echoes and light). Minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven. Some expansion to communal perspective fits the accumulative mosaic design without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and rhythmically controlled with high information density. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, no loops or scaffolding. Minor abstraction ("reef-shadow joy") is voice-motivated. Closure image is clear and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (shell-dwelling poet, galaxy postcard, blossom armistice) feels organic and fresh. Lyrical, mosaic structure is a bold risk that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional specificity and transformative arc avoid template plots.</comment>
