<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to share the heirloom seed's wonder at cost. Interiority is concrete and embodied, as in "the effort was draining," and her final choice is earned by prior causality. However, contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene, limiting the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from threat to action to closure. Orientation is anchored early; closure lands with decisive change and felt cost: the seed dims after transfusion. The parapet as thin place and seed as constraint shape tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the parapet's thinness enables weaving, and the apple tree over the waterfall is the nexus for action. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, charging the final image of rainbows in the mist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving wonder) escalates via Elara's agency under causal lens: the desperate thirst from another world forces the costly choice to share the seed. Cost is unmistakable on-page with the seed dimming, and escalation tightens options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through action and image, culminating in the resonant idea that wonder is preserved by sharing, not hoarding. The final line leans slightly explicit but is earned by prior particulars, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice filtered through Elara's perception. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, e.g., in the meditation on pruning, and no head-hopping or elision issues obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled with vivid imagery, zero loops or scaffold. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere efficiently, as in the cascade of renewed notes washing back. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of weaving between worlds through pruning is fresh and specific, transforming tropes with grounded details like the heirloom seed and crystalline sound. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in quiet lyricism heightens stakes.</comment>
