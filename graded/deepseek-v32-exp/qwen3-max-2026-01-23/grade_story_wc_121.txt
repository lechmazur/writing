<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in sorrow; interiority is embodied with contradictions (e.g., walking shards simultaneously); final acceptance earned through causal navigation with visible cost on page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation anchored early with viaduct and tablet; closure is a decisive change (tear's ripple healing fractures) with cost legible in the release; persistent constraint of eternal cycle shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (viaduct's luminous puddles, crystallized laughter); environment constrains choices (scaling precipices) and charges final image; tablet functions as micro-setting that dictates movement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of conquering self-labyrinth escalates via Elara's agency (tracing runes, facing shards); cost visible in tablet release and cycle transcendence; one meaningful tightening under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of self-acceptance emerges from events and images (labyrinth, ripple); ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through integration; subtext in tone shifts without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (gravity-defier's inverted perception); poetic prose reflects emotional state; rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful figurative language; minor figurative density in peak beats but clarity maintained; no loops or scaffolds; propulsion supports closure without obscuring cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravity defier, procedural generation, and fractured timelines; risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; organic integration with emotional specificity.</comment>
