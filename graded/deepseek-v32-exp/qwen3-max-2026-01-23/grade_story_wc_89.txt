<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied; her final choice to surrender her gift is earned by prior causality with visible cost (loss of self, transformation).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost; accumulative lens holds; orientation clear early; the constraint of surrendering her gift shapes the ritual.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral; the orchard and permanent moonlight charge the final image of intertwined saplings, constraining the ritual's location and outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (reforging bond) escalate through the ritual; protagonist's agency in performing the metamorphosis leads to a cost (loss of former self) that is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of love transcending death emerges through concrete images; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (cosmic intimacy, saplings) without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person POV with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is strong; no head-hopping; elision is purposeful and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without loops or scaffold; figurative language is controlled and pattern-taught; information density high, propulsion maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar elements; the transformation is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes.</comment>
