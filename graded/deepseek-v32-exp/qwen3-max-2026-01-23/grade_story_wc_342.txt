<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's face blindness and tactile sensitivity are concretely embodied, directing her discovery and the epiphany. The final renunciation (walking away without looking back) is earned by the coin's revelation and the impending demolition. Slight deduction for the epiphany being somewhat explicit, but the cost is legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; orientation is immediate. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (the fractal coin redefines limits) with clear cost in the library's destruction. The discovery and realization are causally linked to her traits and the setting's pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tree‑trunk library is a vivid, pressure‑exerting environment that constrains choice (curved walls, demolition) and charges the final image. Sensory details (texture, scent, light) are filtered through Elara's perception and serve the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving beauty against impermanence) escalates through the ticking clock of demolition and the tactile discovery. The protagonist's agency in tracing the coin leads to a deepening that reweights her understanding. Cost is unmistakable in the splintering wood.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (limits as vessels for infinity) emerges from the coin's fractal design and Elara's mural work. The final image of carrying the sky in her palm offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. Slight deduction for one explicit paragraph of realization, but the subtext remains strong.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, tactile perceptual signature. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and the prose rhythm supports the accumulative pressure. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and vivid, with high information density and no scaffold loops. Slight deduction for a minor mixed metaphor ("spiral galaxy within a nautilus shell..."), but clarity and propulsion remain excellent, especially at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of face blindness, fractal artifact, and condemned library creates a non‑obvious exploration of limits. The perspective feels singular and inevitable in hindsight, with risk‑taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
