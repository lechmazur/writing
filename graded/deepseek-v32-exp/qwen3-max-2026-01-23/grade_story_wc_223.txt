<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation and interiority are concrete, and her final choice to place the chessboard is earned by the prior accumulation. However, the "benevolently ruthless" attribute, while demonstrated, lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, limiting the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost in the final image of the chessboard and whispers. The accumulative lens holds, and orientation is immediate. The pattern of walking/spelling words teaches its rule and pays off decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The whispering gallery and chessboard are micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's POV, with the dome's fractures and dust motes creating a vivid atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving small gestures) are signaled early. Escalation under the accumulative lens is achieved through the series of spelled words, each deepening the emotional weight. The cost of remembering is legible, and the final act of placing the chessboard reweights the absence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the chessboard's absence and the whispered gestures. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—hope blooming in "luminous absence"—without moralizing. The integration of loss and memory is complex and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable close third with a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature. The voice is controlled and consistent, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; elision (the spelled words) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without scaffold or loops. Figurative language ("dust motes like scattered stars") is purposeful and clear. Sentence-level propulsion matches the accumulative build, and the final image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a crisis actor, pawnless chessboard, and whispering gallery for an act of "unbinding" is fresh and specific. The lyrical, accumulative structure is a bold risk that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
