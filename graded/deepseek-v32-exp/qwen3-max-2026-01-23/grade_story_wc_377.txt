<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her seasonal muteness, driving her actions to preserve wonder; however, internal conflict is minimal, which slightly limits depth in this quiet narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as the iceberg fragment surrenders its light, under a consistent accumulative/textural lens; orientation is immediate, and the persistent constraint of the kinetic sculpture shapes the finale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting and object work indispensably; the bluff and sculpture constrain Elara's choices, and the iceberg fragment charges the final image with vivid sensory detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are elegantly signaled and escalate through the symphony's crescendo; Elara's agency in activating the sculpture leads to a visible cost in the fragment's expended light.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of non-verbal truth and preservation emerges through concrete images and actions; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature honed by Elara's muteness; rhythmic control supports the accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is densely poetic yet clear, with no artifacts; sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, and figurative language is consistently purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of bell tuning, kinetic sculpture, and post-verbal era feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in quiet structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
