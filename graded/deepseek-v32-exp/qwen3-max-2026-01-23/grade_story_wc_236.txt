<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is vivid with embodied emotion and consistent motivation; the earned change in her perspective is clear, though internal contradiction is minimal, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in "deep trembling calm"; causal lens holds tight from loss to repair to realization; orientation is immediate and persistent constraints shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting and objects—clamp, screw, water clocks—constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, fully integrated with POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through the repair's urgency; agency drives the resolution with legible cost, though time pressure remains gentle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of ordinary miracles emerges organically through action and image, but the final paragraph's explicit statement slightly reduces subtextual resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with stable POV and a perceptual signature filtered through Elara's loss; rhythmic prose supports pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense, with varied rhythm and no loops or artifacts; figurative language is consistent and enhances clarity, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of aromatherapist, water clocks, and midwife's tool feels inevitable; lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
