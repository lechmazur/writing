<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies with the telegram; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (trembling hands, tears). The shift from isolation to connection is earned by Kael's message and her observation, with a visible cost in the prior fatigue and subsequent peace. Minor swiftness in the change is offset by causal anchoring.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orientation is sharp; causal lens holds firmly. Closure is a decisive change from isolation to shared understanding, cost legible in "the weight dissolved into connection." The telegram arrival is slightly convenient but tied to the dream's daylily, and it complicates rather than resolves, requiring her agency to look.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and integral: the observatory and telescope constrain choice; the daylily telegram charges the final image. No white-room syndrome; details are filtered through Elara's expertise and urgency. Minor directness in thematic exposition does not harm closure's charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode inscriptions/overcome isolation) escalates via the telegram clue and her witnessing Mira's dim. Agency drives tightening; cost is felt in the dissolution of weight into connection. One meaningful causal turn suffices; no coincidence resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of shared burdens emerges through variable-star metaphor and daylily reprise; subtext operates in telegram and inscriptions. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer ("We hold the light..."). Some explicit statement in mid‑paragraph is minor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and voice is lyrical, matching Elara's expertise and emotional arc. Minimal dialogue is natural; perception is selectively filtered. No head‑hopping; rhythmic control supports pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and polished with varied rhythm; figurative language is consistent and voice‑motivated. Minor overwriting ("sanctuary of midnight solace") does not obscure causality or closure. No loops or scaffold; information density high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lucid dreaming, astronomy, and shared‑burden metaphor feels organic and inevitable. The daylily telegram and variable‑star method are specific and irreplaceable. Risk in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
