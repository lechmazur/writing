<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot; however, lack of internal contradiction or contradictory impulses in scene prevents a higher score, though her steadfastness is character-appropriate and earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change and cost under causal lens; maze's intervention is earned by prior causality, and the final image reconfigures stakes with felt cost in Kael's cracked meter and flight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral, constraining choices (maze shifts) and charging the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, mirroring theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from start; escalation driven by Elara's agency in confrontation, with legible cost in Kael's humiliation and the maze's reaction, tightening options under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of mended deception emerges organically from events and images, with resonant non-literal resolution in the final paragraph; subtext operates through marbles and garden without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, filtered through Elara's perspective; dialogue natural and goal-driven for Kael.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet controlled, with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts that obscure clarity; figurative language supports pressure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of quantifiable luck and sentient garden feels inevitable; specific details like cracked marbles and phoenix vine transform tropes with risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
