<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is concretely embodied through sensory details and micro-choices; her internal conflict between loss and guidance culminates in an earned release of the burnt feather, with visible cost in the final image. No stock phrasing or diagnostic labels; the epiphany arises from specific, dramatized experience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing) as the feather's release reweights belonging from seeking to practicing, with cost legible in "a promise of release." Orientation is anchored early, and the vibration-to-firefly progression tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice (the dome's crack allows ascent); the burnt feather as micro-setting charges the final image. Sensory selection reflects POV bias—celestial and aquatic details are filtered through Elara's profession and emotional state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, stakes escalate via density of memory and perception; Elara's agency in following the vibration and releasing the feather forces a trade-off with felt cost. The fireflies trigger a cadence shift that reweights her dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through image and action—the feather, fireflies, and exhale pattern culminate in a non-literal answer: belonging as practiced attention. Avoids moralizing; the mentor's line is integrated as memory, not final-paragraph sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature ("shadowseam wonder"); voice modulates poetically under pressure without head-hopping. Memory dialogue is natural and goal-driven, anchoring subtext in shared experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful; sentences accelerate and breathe with scene needs. No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of landscape astrology, underwater ruin, and ephemeral magic feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry. The burnt feather's transformation is grounded in character-specific detail.</comment>
