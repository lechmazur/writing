<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in trait; her infinite patience is embodied in concrete action (decoding knots with reverent focus), and the final realization—that preserving methods is the true treasure—is earned through on-page causality with visible cost in the shifted understanding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate; accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through knot decoding to a resonant reconfiguration (conceptual repricing) where cost is legible in the final image of the fulgurite as "a tiny ark of memory." The constraint of the rope's knots shapes tactics cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective (snow-muffled dock, fog, rope) and actively constrains choice—the rope as micro-setting dictates the decoding action, and the dock's piling charges the final find. Sensory detail is filtered through Elara's professional patience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving ancient methods) escalates via Elara's agency in decoding the knots; the tightening is a single meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens, and cost is unmistakable in the fisherman's lesson and the final pulse of the glass against her heart.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from action and image; subtext in the fisherman's murmur ("We guard the method") leads to a non-literal, resonant answer at closure—the seed as promise, method as eternal—without moralizing, reweighting prior material through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct; voice carries a lyrical, patient perceptual signature ("oceanic hush," "weathered wood") that modulates with pressure but remains consistent. No head-hopping; elision (the knots' meaning) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmically controlled with varied sentence openings; high information density (knots as syllables, glass as ark) and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, clarity unbroken even at peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of seed-collecting, knot-language, and secret weavers feels inevitable; specific details (fulgurite glass, storm-oak) transform familiar archetypes. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative plot heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure lands with fresh inflection.</comment>
