<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior contradiction (fear of molt vs. necessity) is concretely embodied, and her final acceptance is earned through Kael's intervention. The relationship with Kael acts as a crucible, forcing a stance crystallization. Minor deduction for slightly diagnostic phrasing around the molt ("psychic tremor," "vulnerability").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara reconceives her transformation as integral to resistance. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through imagery to the seed-planting act. Cost is legible in her tears and release. Orientation is clear and early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and deeply integrated with POV. The rusted library and the coffee tin are not just backdrop but constrain choice and charge the final image ("luminous fracture"). Micro-setting (the courtyard earth, the seed) actively participates in the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fear that molt betrays the rebuild) is signaled early and escalates through dialogue with Kael. The tightening is a choice to plant the seed, an act of endurance and renunciation that forecloses the path of fear. Cost is felt in her emotional release and the physical act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of transformation as resistance emerges powerfully from concrete images (seed, molt, fracture). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor deduction for Kael's dialogue ("Luminous fracture... Your resistance blooms through transformation") which edges toward thematic echoing, though it remains character-specific.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara's poetic perception. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture with controlled rhythmic variation. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying significant subtext. No head-hopping or distance issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density and strong rhythmic control. Minor risk of overwriting in a few phrases ("psychic tremor," "confluence of selves"), but clarity and propulsion are maintained. No damaging loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of persona-molting, urban renewal, and poetic resistance feels fresh and specific. The core premise is transformed through grounded, lived-in detail. The lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes and coheres with the closure image. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
