<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in past failure, with interiority embodied through the drawer pull; his shift from shame to wisdom is earned, though some diagnostic self-awareness slightly softens the contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost via Elias's internal shift and drawer pull transformation; Accumulative/Textural lens holds; orientation is anchored early; moon-phase constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the parapet and mist mirroring internal states; the drawer pull as micro-setting charges the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of redemption escalates through the tense exchange and internal realization; agency is clear, cost legible in Veridian Pass memory, but escalation under Accumulative lens is slightly subdued.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of recycled wisdom emerges through symbols and action without moralizing; ending reweights prior material via the drawer pull's transformation, offering resonant subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct literary voice; rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping; elision (e.g., silent protocol) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with varied sentences; no loops or scaffolds; figurative language is coherent and supports closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prisoner exchange with unique elements (drawer pull, moon phases); emotional specificity avoids template, but risk-taking is moderate.</comment>
