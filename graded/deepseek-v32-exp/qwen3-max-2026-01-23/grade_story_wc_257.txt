<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's grief and renewal are concretely embodied through trembling hands, calloused palms, and micro-choices like folding cranes; her final decision to weave legacy into art is earned by prior causality with visible cost in softened grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly; orientation is immediate; closure lands on-page with a decisive change (discovery of the grove) that reconfigures her purpose, cost legible in "Tears warmed Elara’s cheeks" and the subsequent renewal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and selective; the observatory and "curtains of intention" constrain choice and charge the final image, with details filtered through Elara's professional bias (aged brass, cold starlight).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (emotional renewal) escalates through Elara's agency—placing cranes, parting curtains—culminating in a discovery that narrows options and reweights cost, all under causal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of "genuinely artificial" hope emerges organically from particulars (origami, jewelry, grove); subtext in gestures; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; lyrical prose reflects Elara's mindset; no head-hopping; elision (e.g., past grief) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold artifacts harm closure; figurative language ("cold starlight," "quiet fire") is purposeful and coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of jewelry making, astronomy, and origami feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; specific details resist template plots.</comment>
