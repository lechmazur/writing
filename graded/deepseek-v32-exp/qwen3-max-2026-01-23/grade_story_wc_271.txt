<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (freeze into grounding) revealing a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation/endurance (tucking photo as testament, not trigger) is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the acceptance of loss. Minor hairline slip: occasional therapy-speak ("integration," "somatic markers") edges toward diagnostic label, but is dramatized within the same beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens held cleanly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with on-page cost—the "realistic weight" of the photograph balanced against the "portable peace." Orientation is immediate; the pattern of sensory accumulation teaches its method by the midpoint and pays off in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is a micro-setting that constrains choice (the arboretum supplies somatic markers for grounding) and charges the final image (the lighthouse reframed). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara’s professional and trauma-shaped perception. No generic placeholder; geography is coherent and tactile.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal integration) escalates through a single meaningful tightening: the freeze triggers a practiced somatic method that deepens into a reconfiguration of the lighthouse and photo. Cost is legible in the “realistic weight” of memory balanced with “portable peace.” Agency is clear; no coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (pearl, lighthouse, sea thrift) without statement; the ending offers a non-literal answer via the image of “broken places foster defiant beauty.” Subtext operates in gesture and silence (the photo handled, the smile at child’s laughter). No moralizing; complexity resides in the mosaic of loss and love.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV, close third-person with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, botanical, trauma-attuned. Voice modulates with emotional pressure (freeze, grounding, reflection) without head-hopping. Purposeful compression (the backstory interleaved with present cues) is taught and pays off. No register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and clear; high information density with minimal scaffold. A slight tendency toward overwriting in early sentences (“ghost of shattering noise”) is quickly corrected by concrete somatic details. No loops or figurative muddle; closure image is sharp. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma recovery with botanical precision and drone-strike specificity; the “pearl of stillness” concept avoids cliché through grounded somatic practice. Transformation of familiar material via unique voice and setting. Risk-taking in accumulative, lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
