<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is concrete and consistent, with clear motivation and micro-choices under pressure. However, the closure cost, while felt, is positive vindication rather than sacrifice, preventing the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal linkage is strong and closure lands on-page with a legible cost (vindication), but the cost lacks traditional weight, keeping it from exceptional tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and integral to choice (hot springs enable unsealing), charging the final image. No flaws, but Q2 cap applies.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency, and cost is conceptual in breaking tradition. However, conflict tension is moderate, limiting higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of evolving tradition emerges organically, with a resonant non-literal answer at the end. No moralizing, but Q2 cap applies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature through plant-telepathy. Voice is lyrical and consistent, though Q2 cap applies.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density and no artifacts. Rhythm supports mood, but some ornate complexity prevents top band due to Q2 cap.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of insurgent grandmother, plant telepathy, and implanted destiny feels fresh and inevitable. Q2 cap applies.</comment>
