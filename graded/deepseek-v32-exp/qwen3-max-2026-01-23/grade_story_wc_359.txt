<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in synesthetic ability, driving her ritual with quiet certainty. However, the character lacks internal contradiction or visible struggle; her emotional progression is linear and untested by genuine friction, limiting depth. The final choice is earned by prior setup but without a felt cost that complicates her path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate; the accumulative lens holds, building toward a resonant reconfiguration where the sculpted hush is reborn as a vessel for wonder. Closure lands with a felt change—physical weariness and transformed silence—though the cost is more transformational than sacrificial. The synchronicity with the sculptor's chisel provides a persistent constraint that shapes the ritual's timing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ice cavern is vividly rendered and functionally essential, constraining the ritual via the aurora's fissure and the ice's responsive resonance. Sensory detail is lush and purposeful, filtered through Elara's synesthesia. The setting charges the final image of humming radiance, meeting the 9+ test but capped due to Q2's score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear—certifying wonder's necessity—but conflict is minimal; escalation is accumulative through bell strikes and ice responses, driven by agency without obstacles. The cost is physical weariness, but no meaningful tightening or trade-off narrows options, limiting pressure under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the ritual's transformative imagery, but the final line explicitly states the thesis ("wonder is... fundamentally necessary"), incurring a thematic echo penalty. Without this didactic note, resonance would be stronger; the ending otherwise offers a non-literal answer through the cavern's humming light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and closely filtered through Elara's synesthetic perception, creating a distinct lyrical signature. Voice is consistent and elevated, matching the ritual's tone. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful. The high score is capped due to Q2's gate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative but purposeful, with varied rhythm and no scaffolding or loops. Information density is high, each sentence advancing atmosphere or action. Overwriting is controlled and pattern-taught. A 9+ quick test is met but capped by Q2's score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of synesthesia, aurora interpretation, and ice ritual feels fresh and specific, avoiding cliché. Emotional truth is anchored in concrete detail. Risk-taking in lyrical density coheres without gimmickry. Ingenuity is high but capped due to Q2's gate.</comment>
