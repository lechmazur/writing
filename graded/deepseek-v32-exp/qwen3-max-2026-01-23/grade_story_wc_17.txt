<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's sensitive perception is shown through embodied actions like feeling vibrations and trembling hands; her transformation from curiosity to covenant is earned with visible cost in her heavier heart, though the trait "sensitively perceptive" is occasionally stated rather than solely dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a conceptual repricing of legacy's burden with legible cost in "heart heavier yet clearer"; accumulative lens holds as discoveries deepen stakes; orientation is immediate with who, where, and when anchored within the first line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—ivy-veiled passage, damp flagstones, stone fireplace—and actively pressures Elara's choices, constraining her discovery and charging the final image of walls dreaming with sensory purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency in uncovering diaries and the film negative; cost is unmistakable in her tears and reconfigured purpose, with one meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of legacy emerges organically from the contrast between burned diaries and preserved film; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of legacy as a thread, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is consistently lyrical and filtered through Elara's perceptual signature, with stable POV and diction that fits the contemplative tone; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; minor figurative density in phrases like "corridor echo cartographer" is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity or propulsion in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is fresh with the corridor echo cartographer and film negative offering a non-obvious synthesis; emotional truth is anchored in concrete particulars, and risk-taking in lyrical introspection heightens stakes.</comment>
