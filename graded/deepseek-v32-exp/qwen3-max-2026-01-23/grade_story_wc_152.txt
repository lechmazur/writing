<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion (e.g., "cold dread settled in her bones, but her hands remained steady"). Her disguise of wisdom as foolishness and sacred drive to listen shape her micro-choices, culminating in an earned decision to deliver the corrected chart. However, interior contradiction is minimal, limiting peak score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: Vega error prompts investigation, revealing conspiracy, leading to corrective action. Closure is a decisive change—truth delivered to Captain Idris—with cost legible in the "weight of the tapestry and the kingdom’s fragile hope." Orientation is anchored early, and no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image: the cobalt observatory's alcove, eternal candle, and embroidery tools enable Elara's method. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., "crimson leaves swirled like embers"). The candle's flame directly shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preventing coup) escalates through Elara's agency: from detecting error to uncovering plot to stitching correction. Cost is visible in her all-night labor and risk. Pressure tightens coherently under the causal lens, with one meaningful deepening that forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (wisdom disguised as foolishness, truth versus deception) emerges organically through Elara's actions and imagery of threads and light. Subtext is rich in her "vacant smile" and the candle's silent farewell. Avoids moralizing, but final lines edge toward explicitness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV (Elara) is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, observant, biased toward celestial metaphor. Voice modulates with pressure (e.g., "thread hummed; shadows danced"). No head-hopping; prose rhythm supports momentum, though occasional ornate diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and purposeful, with high information density. Minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "threads of starlight silver tracing true paths") but no clarity loss. No repetitive loops or scaffolding artifacts; sentence variety supports rhythm. Closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis: galaxy-chart embroiderer using thread and candle to navigate adjacent possibilities unravels a conspiracy. Specific details (eternal candle, cobalt observatory) feel organic, not checklist-driven. Emotional truth and risk-taking heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
