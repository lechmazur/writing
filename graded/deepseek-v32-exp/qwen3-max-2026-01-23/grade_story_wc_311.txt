<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Kael's heartbreak is embodied through deliberate actions; motivation compels higher-stakes choices, and transformation from grief to purpose is earned with visible cost in crystallization. Interiority is concrete without stock phrasing. Final choice of naming the void-beast channels prior causality and cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal chain from discovery to crystallization leads to decisive change; closure on-page with Kael stepping into night as namer of shadows, cost legible in "tears of pure energy" and transformed atlas. Lens (causal) holds; orientation anchored early. Persistent constraint (scattered light) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Observatory and dusk setting are integral, providing prism and light that enable action; micro-setting (atlas page, prism) constrains choice and charges final image of crystallized fears. Sensory detail selective and purposeful, filtered through Kael's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of heartbreak vs. purpose escalates through each named monster; agency in channeling emotions into light drives tightening, with cost paid in energy tears and emotional shift. Under causal lens, escalation is because/therefore with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of naming fears to transform grief emerges through concrete actions; subtext in crystallization metaphor. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing—"a namer of shadows, a weaver of light from loss." Earned wisdom from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV stable, poetic voice with distinct perceptual signature ("dust motes danced..."). Rhythmic control under pressure, no head-hopping; diction and syntax reflect Kael's reaper nature and grief. Purposeful compression taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dense, poetic prose with high information density; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language consistent and clear, supporting momentum without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion varies with scene needs; closure image sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reaper, atlas, and light-crystallization; tropes transformed through specific emotional arc. Risk-taking in lyric density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Feels inevitable in hindsight, with authentic vision.</comment>
