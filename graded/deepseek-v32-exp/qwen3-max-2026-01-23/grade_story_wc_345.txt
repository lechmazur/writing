<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Characters are effectively sketched with clear roles and motivations; the collective unit is portrayed with coordinated grace. However, interiority is limited for individuals due to ensemble focus, though micro-choices (Kael's skepticism, Lena's tracing) reveal character under pressure. The family's unity is earned and their actions align with shared stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal plot with clear orientation early; closure is a decisive change (blight cured, ghost departs) with cost (responsibility passed, ghost's watch ends). The lens holds throughout, and the climax is earned through logical, motivated steps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral, with floating arches and orchard directly constraining choices (scaling for mirrors) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven through action and perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving the orchard) escalates through discovery and collective agency; the tightening (midnight alignment) forces a trade-off (ghost's departure) with cost legible on the page. Pressure coheres under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of unity and brambled hope emerge organically from events and images (chalk messages, bell, nebula). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the ghost's final message.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person omniscient voice is consistent and effective, with clean focalization shifts at section breaks. Prose has a distinct texture, and dialogue (though minimal) feels natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Polished prose with vivid imagery, varied syntax, and strong rhythm. No noticeable artifacts or loops; information density is high, and figurative language supports clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh, imaginative synthesis of elements (orchard planet, altruistic ghost, harmonic bell) feels organic and specific. The premise is transformed through grounded choices and a non-obvious resolution that heightens stakes.</comment>
