<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and trait-consistent, but interiority is minimal and static; no contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. Her final endurance is credible but lacks visible personal cost, reducing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (town revived) with felt cost (collapse averted) under a Causal lens; orientation is immediate. Slight deduction for closure cost being more conceptual than viscerally personal, but structure is tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and integral; the archway and cobblestones constrain choice and charge the final image. Details are filtered through Elara's perception and woven into action, creating a coherent atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through Elara's deliberate steps; agency drives the tightening. However, the cost is more atmospheric than personally felt, limiting the visceral punch required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory and rhythm emerges organically through concrete action and image; the final reconfiguration offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext is rich in the imagery of footsteps and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a lyrical, rhythmic prose that matches the protagonist's perception. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (the wild hush) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with strong rhythmic control; high information density and no loops or scaffold. Minor figurative stacking in early lines does not obscure clarity or momentum at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Concept of rhythmic revival is fresh and specific; the synthesis of bell tuner, ghost town, and footsteps feels organic. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, though closure is somewhat predictable.</comment>
