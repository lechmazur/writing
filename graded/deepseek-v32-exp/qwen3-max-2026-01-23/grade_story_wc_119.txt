<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and intensifies; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion. His regret and hope are contradictory impulses that act in scene, and his final choice (apology) is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The relationship with Elara forces a choice that alters its state, and the emotional progression is realistic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate. Closure is a decisive change (reunion and apology) with felt cost (vulnerability, regret). The plot advances because of Silas's actions; no causality breaks. The final image ("two hearts learning a new melody") reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral, constraining choices (isolation, ferry) and charging the final image (lighthouse as hope). Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("granite teeth," "salt-stained study"). POV filter is consistent; spatial choreography is clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciliation) is signaled early; escalation is driven by Silas's agency (creating and sending the cookie). Cost is legible in his vulnerability and the risk of rejection. One meaningful tightening (Elara's arrival) forecloses his isolation and forces the apology.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of open secrets and reconciliation emerges from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("deepest truths are written plainly"). Subtext operates in gesture (the stone) and implication; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt; voice is distinct, lyrical, and reflects Silas's perception. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident. Dialogue is minimal but natural; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with varied syntax and strong imagery. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Information density is high; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Rhythm supports emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and organic: a lighthouse keeper writing prophetic fortune cookies with microdots. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth is specific; risk-taking (microdots) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
