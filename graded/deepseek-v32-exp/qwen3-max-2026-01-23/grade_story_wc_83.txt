<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's grief and motivation are concrete and drive the story. The final change is earned through her agency, with visible cost in the bleak exhilaration and tears.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain from perturbation to discovery is clear. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration of her purpose, cost etched in starlight and tears.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating observatory and geode crystal are not just backdrop; they constrain and enable the central action, charging the final image of the geode as a key.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start; escalation is driven by her mental nudge and the ticking clock of the circuit breakers, leading to a cost-laden revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of unused potential emerges through specific images and the pool of stolen possibilities; the ending offers a non-literal answer that reweights grief and hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, blending scientific precision with lyrical grief; POV is tightly held, with perception filtered through Elara's trauma and curiosity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops; minor overwriting in the climax ("unfiltered awakening") but clarity maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of trauma, theoretical physics, and a geode resonator feels inevitable; the concept of unused potential pools is fresh and fully committed to.</comment>
