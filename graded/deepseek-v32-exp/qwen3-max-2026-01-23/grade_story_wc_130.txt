<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., kneeling, placing the eyes). The final realization is earned by the ritual, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, which limits the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) via the vision and the final drop; cost is legible in the tear "carrying the weight of understanding." Orientation is immediate, and the hybrid lens (accumulative/textural dominant) holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is vividly specific and charges the final image; the mosaic stone and stalactite’s drip are integral to the ritual and closure. Sensory detail is selective and woven through action, with no static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding loss) tightens through Elara's active ritual, leading to a conceptual repricing. Escalation is driven by her agency under the accumulative lens, and cost is unmistakable in the transformed silence and her tear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete images (mosaic, dovetail, drop) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—love transforms but does not vanish—reweighting prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical, precise, and reflects Elara's conjurer mindset. No head-hopping, and rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with varied rhythm and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent, and information density is high throughout, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements (mathematics of emotion, glass eyes, cavern orchard) feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in the quiet, meditative plot heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure effect is fully integrated.</comment>
