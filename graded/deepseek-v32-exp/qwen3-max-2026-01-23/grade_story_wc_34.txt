<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and embodied, and her final charged poise is earned, but the absence of contradictory impulses in scene prevents the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate; the accumulative lens holds; closure lands with visible cost (ephemeral surface/permanent whisper) and the lightning-thunder constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The misty courtyard and storm light constrain choice (damp stone, narrow window) and charge the final image; sensory detail is selective, vivid, and fully integrated with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early; pressure escalates via the tightening time window and accumulation of symbols; cost is legible in the rain’s cleansing and the etching’s permanence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete symbols and actions; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and closely filtered through Elara’s perceptual signature; voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with rhythmic modulation that supports pressure and closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, figurative, and purposeful with high information density; no loops or scaffold; rhythm and syntax vary naturally to accelerate and breathe with the beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of elements feels inevitable; the lyric, accumulative design commits fully and heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
