<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion in tears and "burnished sorrow." However, her internal conflict is straightforward, lacking contradictory impulses in scene, which limits the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with visible cost in Valerius's tears; causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from storm to mirror-covering to revelation. Orientation is anchored early, and the persistent constraint of time streams shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid and visible time streams are vividly specific and constrain choice—mirrors must be covered to prevent distortion, charging the final projection. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vindication of Kaelen's vision) escalates via the temporal storm, forcing Elara's agency in covering mirrors and devising the projection. Cost is legible in Valerius's humbled acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and reinterpretation emerges through the ritual projection, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in images like the shattered vase and covered mirrors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic signature aligned to Elara's devotion; diction and rhythm control heighten pressure, though minor register elevation in peaks slightly limits the highest band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density, but phrases like "burnished sorrow" edge toward decorative overwriting without harming clarity. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archaeological dispute with temporal physics on a baroque asteroid; the covering-mirrors method is unique and transforms tropes through specific, grounded choices that feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
