<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion. Aris's academically rebellious spirit drives her choices, and her convergence with Elias feels earned with visible cost in tears and revelation. The final stance crystallization is supported by prior causality, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where homecoming is redefined as molecular resonance, with cost legible in characters' tears and the sealed secret. Orientation is early and clear; the fly amber as a persistent constraint shapes tactics and the final image, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, from the rainwashed tower to the overgrown sculpture path, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like petrichor and luminous resin are filtered through Aris's POV, and the micro-setting (fly amber) actively influences the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding homecoming's chemistry) escalates through Aris's agency—following footprints, using the amber—leading to a convergence that narrows options and reweights cost. The emotional price is unmistakable in the chamber scene, meeting the 9+ quick test under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, subtextually exploring homecoming as molecular resonance rather than metaphor. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the fly amber's glow and the tower's luminescence, without moralizing, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature blending scientific lyricism; Aris's skeptic voice controls rhythm and diction even under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, and purposeful elision (e.g., the footprints' origin) pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("honey-colored tear of resin") is consistent and voice-motivated, and the final image achieves clarity without muddle, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of first-contact sci-fi and biochemical mystery feels inevitable in hindsight; the fly amber and molecular memory premise are transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and stakes, with risk-taking that heightens coherence.</comment>
