<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's ambition and sensitivity are concretely embodied through micro-choices like steady hands despite a racing heart, revealing a hierarchy of values. The final understanding—harmonizing with the plant's truth—is earned by prior causality with visible cost in accepting the future stench, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure lands with resonant reconfiguration: Elara achieves serenity within motion through daily ritual, with cost legible in her acceptance of the corpse flower's odour. The lens holds without contradiction, and the seed's constraint shapes tactics from planting to documentation, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and selective, filtered through Elara's POV, enriching atmosphere and mirroring internal states. However, while micro-settings like the pot and balcony support action, they do not decisively constrain choices or charge the final image beyond atmospheric resonance, preventing the highest band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of cultivating serenity escalates through Elara's agency in caring for the seed, culminating in the shoot's appearance as a meaningful deepening. Under the accumulative lens, density increases with journaling, and cost is felt in her embrace of the plant's full spectrum, including future stench.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of serenity within motion emerges organically from particulars like doodled roots, grandmother's wisdom, and the corpse flower's challenge. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the shoot cradled by roots, without moralizing, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature anchored in olfactory sensitivity and lyrical rhythm. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and elision like "turning of the tide’s thought" is taught early and pays off at closure, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied sentence rhythms and high information density. Minor overwriting in phrases like "olfactorily sensitive" slightly jars, but no loops or scaffold that obscure closure; figurative language remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of herbalist ambition, corpse flower lore, and treetop village specifics feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the core premise is transformed through grounded detail.</comment>
