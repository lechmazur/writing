<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is rooted in loss and silence, compelling her choice to sing; interiority is concrete through wood-grain perception, though some emotions are told rather than fully embodied. The final act of singing is earned by prior beats with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure lands with Elara's renewal, cost legible in her shaken breath and memory. Orientation is clear early, and the wrong turn to oasis pattern pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and constrains choice: the train, wind bells, and carousel horse charge the final image. Sensory details are filtered through Elara's POV, creating a cohesive atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are internal, escalating through discovery to the decisive act of singing; under accumulative lens, density increases and cost is felt in the memory of Lily and twelve years of silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of silence as possibility emerges through images and action, not statement; final reconfiguration resists moralizing, though the line "fertile ground waiting for song" leans explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with lyrical voice reflective of Elara's perception; diction and rhythm control heighten pressure, and elision (e.g., memory trigger) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without loops or scaffolds; figurative language is purposeful, and sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive. Minor repetition of phrases like "whispering gleam" is integrated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silent carpenter, abandoned circus, and halo fragment feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, though not groundbreaking.</comment>
