<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but internal contradictory impulses are minimal; her final choice to revalue the moment is earned with visible cost, though lacking deep internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a conceptual repricing with legible cost ("a tangible warmth"); orientation is early and clear, and the columella curl constrains tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective; the columella curl and ember nexus constrain choice and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ test through micro-setting integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, density escalates via Elara's agency; cost is legible in the transformation of the secret and the solidified presence, driving one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is scientifically romantic and consistent, with rhythmic control under pressure and no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and synthesized; alchemy for emotional revaluation feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric accumulative style heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
