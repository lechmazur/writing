<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's embodied anxiety and Elara's frustrated rigidity ground their motivations; the final annotation is earned through prior teaching and micro-choices, with cost in Kael's resisted retreat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal linkages tighten from exile to annotation; closure lands with Elara's "Return" and the swing's renewed arc, costing Kael's vulnerability and her endured ache.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The library's twilight and the trapped shadow charge every beat; the tea leaves and glass pane constrain choice, making setting active in the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's engagement with the tea-leaf geometry; her agency in annotating forces a decisive change with visible cost in her shifted stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of geometric hope emerges from the swing's arc, the shadow's fossil, and the leaf patterns; the ending reweights absence as navigable without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Omniscient POV maintains a consistent poetic register, blending Kael's and Elara's perceptions smoothly; dialogue carries subtext and advances the mentor-student dynamic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of shard-mirror archivist, reversible exile, and tea-leaf cartography feels fresh and inevitable; risks in magical realism heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
