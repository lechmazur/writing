<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's embodied emotion and micro-choice (opening the palette) are earned through causal dialogue; Kael is functional but serves as catalyst. The final choice emerges from cracked assumption with visible cost (tear, sob).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate. Closure is a decisive change (possession reversed, palette opened) with felt cost in the anchor's groaning and Elara's emotional release. Time constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (dimensional anchor) and objects (palette, loop pedal) pressure choices and charge the final image. Sensory details (silent shockwave, scent of rain) are selective and woven through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (anchor unraveling, possession) escalates via dialogue and environmental cues. Kael's agency drives tightening; cost is legible in the anchor's flicker and Elara's choked sob. One meaningful turn suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (wholeness vs. reduction) emerges organically from particulars (cobalt blue, hidden latch). Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer: "Crimson blending into lonely cobalt was not erasure, but promise." No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Kael with brief dips into Elara's sensation; voice is lyrical and consistent. Dialogue (only Kael's) is formal and rhetorical, fitting his role. No head-hopping confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense but controlled, with high information density and varied rhythm. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language ("solidified silence") is coherent and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of exorcism, silence, and color psychology feels inevitable. The loop pedal priest and dimensional anchor are fresh, specific, and fully committed. Emotional truth anchors speculation.</comment>
