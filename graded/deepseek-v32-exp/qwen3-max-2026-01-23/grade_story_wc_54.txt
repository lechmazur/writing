<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's curiosity and creative engineering are consistently embodied in concrete actions, and her stoic resolve feels character-particular. However, the absence of internal contradiction or a felt cost in her final choice limits the characterization's depth, though the epiphany is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing via the new equation and star-chart image, with a legible conceptual cost (hope redefined through effort). The causal lens holds tightly from discovery to action to result, and the sextant's geometric constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The abandoned terminal is not just backdrop; its cracked tiles, hidden aqueduct, and dry fountain constrain and enable Elara's key choice. The sextant piece and the terminal's architecture charge the final image, making setting indispensable to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: finding the sextant narrows her focus, and redirecting the flow constitutes a meaningful tightening. The cost is legible in her labor and the terminal's transformed state, though stakes remain more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from action and image, culminating in the resonant, non-literal equation. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing, though the explicit statement of the equation slightly reduces ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and filtered through Elara's engineer-poet consciousness, with a distinct perceptual signature. The voice blends technical precision and lyrical observation without register drift, and rhythmic control supports pressure throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and varied syntax. Minor clichés ("breath a faint mist") and a slight over-reliance on figurative language in early beats prevent a higher score, but no artifacts obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of civil engineering, celestial navigation, and abandoned spaceports is fresh and non-obvious, feeling inevitable in hindsight. The risk of a quiet, conceptual resolution pays off with a coherent and singular artistic stance.</comment>
