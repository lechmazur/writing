<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The poet's motivation is clear, rooted in specific, embodied grief and the tangible micro-choice of capturing the melody. His "positively wistful" tenderness blends contradictory emotions effectively. The final transformation into "keeper of echoes" is earned by the on-page ritual. A slight deduction for moments where emotion edges toward telling ("a wound he now sought to heal") rather than pure embodied showing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held consistently. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the poet's purpose crystallizes and his self-concept is reconfigured ("no longer the poet who fled..."). Cost is legible in the tears and the sealed jar as an "apology." The pattern of gathering and translating is taught early and pays off cleanly. Slight ambiguity in the causal link between the music box and his grandmother's treasure is a minor, non-closure slip.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through the poet's perception ("dust motes danced in slivers of light"). The loft and jars function as a micro-setting that houses his purpose. However, while atmosphere is lush, the environment does not actively constrain a choice or decisively charge the final image; it is a vessel for his actions, not a pressure. This prevents a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive intensification: the discovery and playing of the music box deepens the personal stake and transforms the abstract goal into a specific act of reconnection for Elara. The cost is the felt weight of years lost. Agency is clear in his ritual of capture and inscription. The dominant stake (preserving song/offering apology) is signaled early and meaningfully tightened.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of "gleaned redemption" emerges organically from concrete actions (cleaning the box, capturing the sound, inscribing the jar) and is crystallized in the resonant, non-literal final image of the "library of love." It avoids moralizing, instead offering a conceptual repricing of regret as offering. The integration is seamless and charged, though the phrase "gleaned redemption" itself is stated, slightly reducing subtextual discovery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable, close third-person with a distinct perceptual signature ("the sky bled from indigo to pearl"). The lyrical, slightly elevated voice is consistent and character-appropriate, modulating effectively under emotional pressure. Syntax and rhythm are controlled and purposeful. No head-hopping or register drift. A hairline slip in a mildly overwrought phrase ("the atmosphere thick with the beauty of solitude") slightly tempers the score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is often lush and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, artifactual phrasing and mild overwriting create friction: "profound hush of lonesome splendor" is decorative; "sweetening the raw dawn chorus" is a slightly strained metaphor; adjacent paraphrase occurs ("sorrow and solace," "apology, a legacy, a key"). These patterns, while not catastrophic, dull the closure image's clarity and momentum, triggering a patterned-artifact penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The core premise—a poet capturing sounds in jars as redemption—is a fresh, specific synthesis of familiar ideas (memory, loss, art). The transformation of regret into a physical library of love feels organic and inevitable in hindsight. The lyric mode is a committed risk that heightens stakes. It avoids being derivative through grounded, tactile detail and emotional specificity.</comment>
