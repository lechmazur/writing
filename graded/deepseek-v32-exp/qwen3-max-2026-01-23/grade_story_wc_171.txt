<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and rooted in redemption, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices like tracing the clipboard. His confession and resignation are earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his tremor and departure. No diagnostic label-speak; flaws drive the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (signing and resigning) with felt cost on-page. Causal lens holds via Kaelen's actions leading to peace. Orientation is clear early; the ritual and clipboard constrain tactics, enhancing closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with sensory details like "sun-bleached limestone" filtering through POV. The terrace and ebony clipboard constrain choices and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (peace/redemption) escalates through Kaelen's agency—his confession tightens options and forces a trade-off. Cost is legible in his resignation and the delegates' reactions, driving the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of flawed beauty emerges from particulars like the "cracked terrace," not direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the image of imperfect courage, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is rhythmic and controlled under pressure. Dialogue carries subtext (e.g., elder's spat), and elision (ritual significance) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language ("boots whispered") is consistent and clear, even in peak beats like the confession.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Concept is familiar but transformed through specific details (e.g., clipboard, ritual) and emotional truth. Synthesis feels inevitable, though not groundbreaking, with risk in the confession charging stakes.</comment>
