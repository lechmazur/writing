<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and conflicted, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure; his final act of vouchsafing the forget-me-not is earned by prior causality, showing a thawing of his fractured spirit with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure lands with charged poise as the thaw within Elias reconfigures the relationship, cost legible in "a gentle crack in the ice around his heart." Orientation anchored early, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting and objects (pillbox, snow code) constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details like "mist weaving through ancient pines" are selective and filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Internal stakes escalate through density increase under accumulative lens; Elias's agency in revealing the flower drives the climax with unmistakable emotional cost, tightening the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of mending emerges through images like the forget-me-not and thawing earth; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material with subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is selective, and rhythmic control under pressure supports the accumulative design without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Polished, dense prose without artifacts; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, propulsion maintained through varied syntax, and no loops or scaffold obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms the burned spy trope through specific imagery and emotional depth; risk-taking in quiet, lyric resolution heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
