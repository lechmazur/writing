<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Aris's shift from clinical detachment to humble observation is earned through concrete micro-choices; his internal contradiction (dismissing vs. being held by the dust) and final renunciation of control carry visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (conceptual repricing of decay) with cost legible in "The needless drama he sought to strip was his own frantic need to control meaning." Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of daily returns tightens toward the shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The greenhouse and the dust-patterned leaf function as micro-setting that constrains choice (leaving leaf untouched) and charges the final image; sensory details are selective, vivid, and filtered through the POV’s evolving perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through density of observations; protagonist agency (returning daily, sketching, deciding to facilitate repair) drives the deepening, with cost unmistakable in the surrender of his need to control meaning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully from particulars, but the final paragraph states the thesis explicitly ("meaning accumulates quietly, like dust on a leaf..."), incurring a −0.6 penalty for thematic echo that touches closure, though the resonant leaf image remains strong.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; voice shifts from scientific to poetic in a controlled, character-specific way; perceptual signature (noticing as a researcher then as a student of patience) is distinct and consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density, but a slight tendency toward explicit summary in the closure beats ("teaching humility to those who wait") prevents a 9+ score; otherwise, no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neutron star researcher and greenhouse decay feels organic and inevitable; risk-taking in a quiet, internal arc heightens stakes through specificity and conceptual contrast, without gimmickry.</comment>
