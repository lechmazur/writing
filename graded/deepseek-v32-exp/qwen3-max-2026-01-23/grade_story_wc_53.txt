<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in regret; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion like "tears welled." The integration with her ghost is earned through prior fragments, showing contradictory impulses. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost legible in "Tears welled." The halted carousel and camera wheel provide persistent constraints. Orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with the kinetic lagoon and carousel; the disposable camera wheel constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are internal conflict with eroded ambitions; escalation via fragment accumulation leads to integration. Agency is Elara's active collection and negotiation; cost is felt in her realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of integration and acceptance emerges from fragments and negotiation; subtext in gestures like offering the wheel. Ending with "I am enough" provides resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct perceptual signature from Elara's chronologically confused mind; voice is poetic but consistent. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense but controlled with high information density; no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and serves the accumulative texture without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of celestial mechanics with personal regret; negotiation with one's ghost is a fresh take on self-reconciliation. Specific details like the disposable camera wheel enhance irreplaceability.</comment>
