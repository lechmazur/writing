<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied; her "furiously tranquil" focus drives consistent actions leading to an earned epiphany with visible cost (frozen tear). However, internal conflict is subtle rather than strongly contradictory, preventing a top-tier score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing of borrowed time as a covenant; the Accumulative lens holds as sensory density escalates to the vortex opening; cost is legible in the tear and the reconfigured perspective of the garden as a cradle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (frost-laden air, gleaming acorn cap) pressure choices; the icebound setting and acorn cap constrain action and charge the final image of the garden as a promise-laden cradle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover texture of borrowed time) escalates through Elara's agency in decreasing entropy; cost is felt in the covenant understanding and tear, reweighting options under accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete actions and images; subtext in vortex inheritance and seeds culminates in a non-literal answer—borrowed time as a sacred exchange—without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with a lyrical, perceptual signature aligned to character; rhythmic prose supports accumulative intensity without head-hopping or clarity loss.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful figurative language; no loops or scaffold; sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, sustaining momentum to closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of seed-saving lore with temporal magic; specific details (heirloom seeds, entropy decrease) feel inevitable; lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
