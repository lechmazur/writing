<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—to map "the geography of healing"—is abstract but grounded in concrete actions and sensory immersion. Her interiority is embodied (tears, focus on the thread) and her final understanding is earned through the intimate act and dialogue. However, the lack of contradictory impulses in scene prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly; orientation is immediate. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing) where absence is revalued as "holy space," with cost legible in Elara's tears and the pressed thread. The thread and garden act as persistent constraints that shape the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and inseparable from theme; the autumn garden functions as a "living atlas" that charges the final image. Sensory details (crushed leaves, scent of decay) reflect POV and escalate toward closure. The thread and garden elements constrain choice and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, stakes (understanding healing) escalate through density of detail and the encounter with Kael. Protagonist agency—projecting presence, receiving wisdom—drives the deepening, with visible cost in her tears and the transferred "map." A single meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete images (thread, garden features, persimmon) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"explained absences are holy spaces"—that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and implication (Kael's gift, the pressed thread).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature. Voice modulates purposefully from dense description to spare dialogue. No head-hopping; elision (the queen's past) is taught and pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is densely textured but controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variation. Figurative language ("shattered stained glass") is coherent and advances atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts that obscure causality; closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise—a traveler writing obituaries for the living, investigating absence through projected presence—is fresh and specific. Synthesis of healing as geography feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
