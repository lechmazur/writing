<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in personal history; her actions under pressure reveal her character through precise, illustrator-like choices. However, internal contradiction is minimal, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal structure tight with clear orientation; closure lands decisively with emotional cost when she hears her mother's lullaby, and the giant's nap constraint shapes every tactical move.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the Silent Pause, forcing Elara to borrow time and sculpt a key; her agency drives the climax, with cost legible in the spent seconds and emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory and freedom emerges through the echo's release and her decision to illustrate its essence, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinctively observational, matching her profession; third-person limited POV remains stable, with perceptual signature in details like "sonic maps" and "frost patterns."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of echoes, time-sculpting, and giant's nap feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in world-building heightens stakes without sacrificing coherence.</comment>
