<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but she lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting in scene; her mild obsession is shown through precise actions without on-page struggle, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with the completed map as a guide, cost implied in her obsession and the timeframe. Orientation is clear early, and the lens is coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail, and the gold leaf booklet charges the final image, but the environment does not strongly constrain choice, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are internal and abstract; escalation occurs through density increase in mapping silence, driven by Elara's agency, but lacks a traditional tightening of options or palpable cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of silence as map emerges organically from imagery and action; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, but Q2 caps prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV with a distinct, poetic voice; perceptual signature is consistent and rhythmic control supports the accumulative design, no head-hopping or distance issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative with high information density; no loops or scaffold artifacts, but some overwriting is consistent and voice-motivated, not harming clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Concept is fresh: mapping emotional terrain through silence. Specific details like the flaking gold leaf booklet and synthesis feel inevitable, with risk-taking in the lyrical approach.</comment>
