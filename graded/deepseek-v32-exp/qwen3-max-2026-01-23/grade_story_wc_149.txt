<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ghost bride's motivation is clear and conflicted; mournful elation embodies contradictory impulses. Her final dissolution is earned by prior devotion, with visible cost. Interiority is concrete through spectral sensations; no stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a decisive change with on-page cost as she dissolves. Orientation is immediate; plot escalates through resonant awakenings to a satisfying payoff. Persistent constraint of her ephemeral nature shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and pressures choices; the orchard greenhouse and stone bead are micro-settings that constrain actions and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through ghostly POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start; escalation is driven by her agency in awakening plants, culminating in the Heartwood activation. Cost is legible in her dissolution. One meaningful tightening leads to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of love as poison and cure emerges through images and actions, not statement. Ending offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in "lovingly venomous" deepens the theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; voice is poetic and consistent with ghostly perception. Rhythmic control supports pressure; no head-hopping or distance issues. Perceptual signature is distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear, enhancing atmosphere without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost bride, alchemical orchard, and resonant awakenings feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific details; emotional truth anchors the concept. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
