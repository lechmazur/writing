<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; his final shift from harvest to protection is earned by the gathering of echoes and the twig test. Interiority is concrete and embodied (breath caught, arrow tip warm), though contradictory impulses are not deeply dramatized, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orientation is clear within the first paragraph; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building to a Conceptual Repricing where the source is redefined as a covenant. Closure lands with cost: his mission permanently shifts to protection, foreclosing the initial harvest path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the inverted gravity, water-flow navigation, and floating arches constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Kael's pilot perspective, creating a fully integrated world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save the groves) escalates through Kael's agency as he follows the arrow tip and witnesses accelerated growth. The tightening occurs at the Cradle Arch, where discovery forces a trade-off: he renounces harvesting to protect, with cost legible in the mission shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the withered twig’s transformation and the echoes coalesce into a non-literal answer—resilience is memory and reverence. The final image reweights the quest without moralizing, offering resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature ("whirling silence," "gathering of echoes"). Rhythmic control supports pressure; no head-hopping. Voice is consistently elevated but character-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density; sentences vary rhythmically, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Slight abstraction in the epiphany is grounded by concrete imagery, and no figurative muddle obscures closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of inverted gravity, orchard pilot, and memory-as-resilience feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric voice heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the arrow tip's reweighting from compass to listener's tool is a fresh, non-obvious inflection.</comment>
