<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (planting seeds, handling bread). Her internal shift from observing loss to actively nurturing is earned via on-page micro-choices, and her relationship with Madame Lin functions as a subtle crucible. The final "absolution" feels slightly abstract but is anchored in the tactile moment of breaking bread.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara's pocket crust transforms from "relic of loss" to "compass toward resilience," reconfiguring her stance with undeniable cost felt in the tear and shared bread. Orientation is anchored within first 45 words, and the single-scene structure tightens cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is not just vivid but essential: the overgrown courtyard constrains the action (uncloaking soil) and charges the final image (the promise of green defiance). Sensory details (fading yeast, moss, steam) are filtered through Elara's POV and serve the thematic reclamation. Hits the 9+ test decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding sacredness in loss) escalates through accumulative deepening: from memory, to planting, to the gift of bread. Agency is clear in Elara's choice to plant and later to share. Cost is legible in the tear "baptism" and the transformed crust. Coheres perfectly under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme ("sacred in the ordinary") emerges entirely through concrete particulars—the bread, the seeds, the uncloaking of soil. No moralizing; the final image of "absolution blooms where care is planted" is a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the earlier loss. Avoids sentimentality through specific, earned detail.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Elara's perceptive bias. POV is stable single-third-person deep focalization. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext and quiet revelation ("baked today to honor what was, and what can be"). The lyrical compression is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor risk of overwriting in phrases like "heuristically gentle precision," but it's voice-consistent and doesn't obscure causality. No loops or scaffold artifacts. Information density is high; every sentence advances character or atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of "creeping normality noticer," guerrilla gardening, and quiet spiritual resilience feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded details (the crust, the recipe, the clover seeds). Avoids cliché through emotional specificity and a non-obvious resolution.</comment>
