<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Kael's dual allegiance and orderly-intuitive nature are concretely embodied in micro-choices like encoding the nautilus shell; his final stance—leveraging his role while the graffiti network safeguards voice—is earned by prior causality with visible cost (hopeful desperation, impending takeover). No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains specific and pressured.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: OmniCorp threat → Kael's graffiti plan → community ignition → Charged Poise at dawn. Closure lands on-page with felt cost ("heart a tight knot of hopeful desperation") and the foundation stone chip as a persistent constraint shapes tactics. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The raft-city carnival is vividly sensory and actively constrains choice: graffiti becomes the resistance medium, and setting details (Ferris wheel, spice market) are woven into Kael's actions. The environment charges the final image—carnival lights flicker as a "resilient anthem." No postcard description; micro-setting alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultural survival vs. privatization) escalates through Kael's agency: his graffiti method triggers community-wide participation, tightening options and raising cost before OmniCorp's arrival. Cost is legible in "hopeful desperation" and the impending noon deadline. One meaningful deepening under causal lens suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resilient cultural memory emerges through particulars—graffiti as living nervous system, foundation stone as compass—without moralizing. Ending offers a non-literal answer: "the carnival’s heart still beat strong" reweights prior struggle. Subtext operates in silent alliances (Elara’s silver keyhole).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature filtered through Kael’s orderly-intuitive mind. Voice modulates from lyrical ("chaotic mosaic") to urgent ("shadowed alleyways") without head-hopping. Minimal dialogue is goal-driven (Elara’s silent vow). Rhythm controls pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsion: "encode vital messages... within the carnival’s ubiquitous graffiti art" advances plot, character, and theme. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentence-level rhythm varies naturally. Information density high—every line works.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of gentrification resistance, floating carnival, and graffiti as covert network feels inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific lived detail (nautilus shell map, flour-paste signals). Risk-taking in lyrical compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
