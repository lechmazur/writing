<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., tear through soot); final choice to abandon flawed glass is earned by prior causality (bookmark's message) with visible cost (weight lifting), meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: her heart thaws and safe zones redefine from shield to lens; cost is legible in "weight lifted" and "chest felt open"; accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with persistent constraint (cracked bookmark) shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (frost-rimed control room, thaw outside) and constrains choice; micro-setting (bookmark, torch) charges the final image where dome refracts light through cracks, meeting the 9+ test for environmental pressure on closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sanctuary for inquiry) escalates via hairline fracture forcing abandonment; agency drives tightening under accumulative lens, with cost unmistakable in her slumped shoulders and renewed resolve, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (bookmark line, flawed glass, dome); ending offers resonant non-literal answer through image of fracture as art, avoiding moralizing and reweighting prior material with earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (contemplative, poetic narration); voice modulates with emotional intensity (e.g., "weighty lightness"); no head-hopping, and elision (like library flood) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control; no loops or scaffolds; figurative language ("liquid metronome") is consistent and purposeful; closure image remains clear without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of glassblowing in post-thaw setting transforms tropes through specific character choices; risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
