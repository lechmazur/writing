<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with embodied emotion and an earned renunciation. However, internal contradiction is not dramatized in scene, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation anchored early; closure lands with on-page cost (ruby flake dissolves) and a decisive change (restoration over ascent), driven by the persistent time constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the waterfall's time constraint and the monolith's peeling mechanics directly shaping Elara's choices and charging the final image of renewal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find stairway before dawn) escalates via protagonist agency under causal lens; cost is legible in the ruby flake's dissolution and her renunciation of the throne.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from action and image; the ending reweights ascension as restoration without moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the orchard's awakening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with a distinct perceptual signature; poetic diction and rhythm modulate with pressure, maintaining clarity and coherence throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without artifice; high information density and varied sentence rhythm advance momentum, and no loops or figurative muddle obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar tropes via specific details (peeling paint, futuristic nostalgia); the twist that the throne is a catalyst feels inevitable and heightens stakes.</comment>
