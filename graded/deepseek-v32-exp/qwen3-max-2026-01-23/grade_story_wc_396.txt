<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character is coherent and motivation drives all choices, but interiority leans abstract ("calmly intuitive nature") rather than concretely embodied under pressure. The final choice to implant the crystal is earned and carries visible cost in the transformed shadow, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (orchard blooms, ice becomes guardian) with felt cost in the peacekeeper's altered state and the world's sigh of relief. Structure is taught early (three mirrors) and pays off decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and actively pressures the action (perilous cliff, encroaching ice). The vintage shop mirrors function as a crucial micro-setting that constrains the method and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (orchard's survival) are clear; escalation builds through the sequential gathering of emotional glimpses, each deepening the peacekeeper's synthesis. The cost is legible in the "weighted breath" moment and the final transformative act. Agency drives the resolution under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of empathetic restoration versus logical force emerges organically from action and image. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—salvation through listening and synthesis—without moralizing. The core concept ("courageous anomaly") is fully integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and consistent. The voice has a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature ("shadow-laced," "emotional echoes") that remains controlled under pressure. No head-hopping; all elision is purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with strong rhythmic control. Minor risk of figurative stacking ("visual echo," "splinters of a future") but clarity and momentum are maintained, and the closure image is sharp. No loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fantasy, ecological stakes, and a therapeutic metaphor (reconstitution through emotional echoes). The "courageous anomaly" concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and method, creating a fresh, inevitable-feeling whole.</comment>
