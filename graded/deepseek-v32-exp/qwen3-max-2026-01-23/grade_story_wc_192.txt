<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in past trauma, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final renunciation (not opening the door) is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the bridge-not-crossed stance. Contradictory impulses of self-preservation versus empathy act simultaneously in scene, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orientation is clear within 120 words; causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from fading threshold to reinforced boundary. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost on-page ("Some bridges were meant to be felt, not crossed"). Persistent constraint of the sanctuary threshold shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices: the charcoal sanctuary, ash floor, and starlight constrain action and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and woven through action, with the door and threshold acting as micro-setting that directly alters tactics. Environment meaningfully shapes the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving sanctuary while easing suffocation) escalates through protagonist agency under causal lens. Elara's decision to link through scars is a meaningful tightening that forecloses the option of opening the door with visible cost. Cost is legible in the final image of solidified threshold and mutual breath.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of isolation versus empathy emerges organically from concrete actions and images, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "classroom for the soul" realization, reweighting prior material without stated thesis. Slight thematic echo in that line is earned by dramatized cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature; voice modulates with emotional intensity but remains coherent. Elara's way of noticing shadows and starlight is character-specific, and rhythmic control under pressure supports closure. No head-hopping or distance issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with no mixed metaphors or register drift in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of solitary healer tropes through specific details (shadow keeper, charcoal sanctuary, linking through scars). Risk-taking in lyrical, introspective style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with transformation via lived detail.</comment>
