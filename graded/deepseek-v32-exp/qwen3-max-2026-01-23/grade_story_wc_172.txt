<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's interior contradiction between amoral pragmatism and secret sentimentality is embodied in micro-choices (trembling hands, tear) and drives the ritual; his final release is earned by prior causality with visible cost, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orientation is anchored early; accumulative/textural lens holds tightly, building to a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the cost of his mask returning is legible in the tear and thunder's verdict, satisfying closure with felt price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The salt flat and cracks constrain choice and charge the final image, serving as micro-setting that shapes the ritual; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Silas's perception to mirror internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Silas's agency in releasing the egg, a meaningful tightening that forecloses options; cost is unmistakable in his tear and the fleeting peace, reweighting stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory and guilt emerges through concrete particulars (egg, cracks, song) without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in the echo of wings and secret peace, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, precise language reflects Silas's consciousness; rhythmic control under pressure (e.g., short sentences at climax) supports the accumulative drive without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, propelling momentum without obscuring clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of amoral philanthropist and extinct bird ritual feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet, introspective plot heightens stakes through specific detail and emotional specificity, transforming familiar tropes.</comment>
