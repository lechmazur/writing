<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "doubt was a heavy frost"). Her final acceptance is earned through ritual and causality, with visible cost in the softening of doubt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost ("softened into solemn peace"); orientation is anchored early; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds tightly, with static bursts and coins driving a coherent before/after shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice—the ambered observatory and coins charge the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's POV to mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Elara's purpose) escalates through her agency in distilling static bursts; cost is legible in her acceptance, and under the Accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully to reweight options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from imagery and action—backwards prophecy as memory given voice; subtext is rich without moralizing, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, reflecting Elara's cosmic focus; no head-hopping, and rhythmic control supports pressure throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and enhances clarity, especially in peak beats like the distillation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept is fresh—post-contraction universe and backwards prophecy—with specific synthesis; risk-taking in quiet, contemplative plot heightens stakes, and the integration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
