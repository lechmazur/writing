<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation and interiority are vividly rendered; her shift from certainty to curiosity is earned through concrete micro-choices and embodied realizations. The final choice carries visible cost, satisfying the quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causality is tight, with the nickel discovery triggering a chain of revelations that culminate in a decisive change. Closure lands with cost (renouncing certainty), and the causal lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Sound Wave Garden is not just backdrop but an active participant, enabling the key sound event. The nickel and mural function as micro-settings that charge the final image with resonant meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from scholarly curiosity to personal transformation, driven by Elara's agency. The cost of exchanging certainty for curiosity is legible and reweights her future actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Elara's awakening, avoiding moralizing. The final image (returning the nickel, writing "Listen with curiosity") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Close third-person POV remains stable, filtered through Elara's perceptual signature. The lyrical, precise prose reflects her profession and state of mind without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical but controlled, with high information density and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent, supporting the story's magical realism.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The concept of a sound-activated mural and nested awakenings feels fresh and specific. The integration of the hobo nickel as an acoustic prism is original and indispensable to the plot.</comment>
