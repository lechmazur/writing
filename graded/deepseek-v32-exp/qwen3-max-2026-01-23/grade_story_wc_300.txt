<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's grief and motivation are concrete; interiority shown through embodied emotion (e.g., choked sob); final choice to release the pearl is earned by prior confessions with visible cost, satisfying the quick test for contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elias crowns the shell; cost legible in pearl's release; accumulative lens holds with clear orientation early; persistent constraint of pearl shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal caves constrain choice by providing the shell and latent radiance; sensory details selective and purposeful; environment charges the final image, meeting the 9+ test for constraining choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (dissolving isolation) escalate via Elias's reading of confessions; agency in crowning drives climax; cost on-page in pearl's transformation, fitting accumulative lens with one meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of empathy emerges through confessions and pearl's transformation; subtext in shell etchings; slight deduction for explicit epiphany line, but ending offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature (inspector's eye for detail); voice is lyrical and consistent; rhythmic control under pressure in hesitation beat; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density; no loops or scaffold; figurative language supports theme without muddle; sentence rhythm varies naturally, advancing story.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of doomsday inspector with mystical ritual; tropes transformed through specific details like pearl and shell; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
