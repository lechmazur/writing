<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Characterization is concrete with embodied emotion and clear motivation, but lacks internal contradiction or flaws that would elevate to exceptional. Final realization is earned, yet Elara's competence remains steady without significant struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost ("profound peace"), drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, and orientation is anchored early. The film strip as constraint shapes the final image decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through POV, with the film strip and booth constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, achieving micro-setting integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding unused love) escalates through density increase under the Accumulative lens, driven by Elara's agency in psychometry. Cost is legible in the "weight of understanding."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like goodbye letters and spatial negative, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Epiphany is earned through concrete memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice modulates with pressure, and elision (memory transition) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density, varied rhythm, and zero loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and clarity is maintained even in peak beats like "hushed thunder."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of crystal gazer, psychometry, and celluloid feels inevitable; tropes are transformed through specific emotional truth. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
