<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and a meaningful change from observation to action. However, she lacks internal contradiction or flaws, making her somewhat one-dimensional and reducing complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early; causal lens holds with a decisive change (Kael's isolation crumbles) and visible cost (emotional vulnerability). The two-shard structure is legible, though the transition to "next dusk" is slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory detail; the crystal forecourt and lens function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. The setting is integral to the plot and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thawing mistrust) escalates through Elara's agency in projecting the symbols, with a visible cost in the risk of rejection. The tightening is meaningful and drives the closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of honesty and transparency emerges through symbols and action, with subtext in the doodles. The final paragraph's explicit statement is somewhat on-the-nose but earned by prior events.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; lyrical voice matches Elara's reverence. No dialogue, but perceptual signature is distinct and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no major artifacts or loops. Some descriptions verge on purple but remain controlled and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original premise with unique setting and method; archetypal characters are elevated by specific, fresh details. Capped due to Q2 not reaching 9.0, though ingenuity is high.</comment>
