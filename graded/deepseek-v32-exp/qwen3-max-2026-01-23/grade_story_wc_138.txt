<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kaelen's immortal ennui and specific yearning are concretely embodied; his micro-choice to step through the tear is motivated by pierced boredom and deep curiosity, earning his transformative closure. Interiority avoids stock phrasing, though a slight tendency toward elevated, diagnostic language ("polished his boredom to a flawless, suffocating sheen") appears but is anchored in the POV's ancient perspective. The final endurance as "keeper of the threshold" is a credible Earned Stasis with visible cost (tears, transformed perception).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing: the library reveals "the after" as sacred remembrance, reweighting Kaelen's premise with undeniable cost (tears, dissolved amulet). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds via density of imagery and emotional resonance toward this reconfiguration. Orientation is immediate and functional; the spatial mutiny's cause (storm + amulet) is sufficiently signaled. The final image of transformed crystals makes the cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and deeply woven into POV; the prismatic escondite and the library of light are micro-settings that charge the final image (crystals gain "witnessed peace"). The environment constrains choice (solitude makes the mutiny catalytic) and shapes tactics (dimensional awareness guides him). Some reliance on visual spectacle, but it serves the accumulative, lyric mode. Spatial choreography is clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive intensification: the solar storm triggers the spatial mutiny, which deepens from anomaly to compassionate delivery mechanism, reweighting Kaelen's dominant stake (what comes after goodbye). Protagonist agency is clear (the step through the tear). Cost is felt in the emotional release and the amulet's dissolution. One meaningful tightening is sufficient and well-executed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars—the amulet's absorbed sorrow, the library of goodbyes—avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "after goodbye came remembrance." The final image of transformed crystals and Kaelen's smile reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates through motif (the fragment, the hushed thunder) charged at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature fitting an immortal consciousness. Diction is elevated but consistent, pattern-taught. Psychic distance is controlled, blending observation with interiority. No head-hopping. The voice modulates with pressure (sharp intrigue, serene emergence). Some syntactic complexity is purposeful within the accumulative mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density; sentences advance atmosphere, character, and plot. Rhythm varies effectively, supporting the accumulative build. Minor overwriting risk in stacked metaphors ("geode of impossible scale," "silent aurora") but they cohere within the taught pattern and do not obscure closure. No obvious loops, scaffold, or register drift. Closure image remains clear and potent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of immortal boredom, spatial mutiny, and a library of remembrance feels fresh and non-obvious. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices (activation via magnetic fields, the amulet's curse as absorbed sorrow). Emotional specificity avoids generic templates. Risk-taking with lyrical density heightens stakes without becoming gimmicky. The core concept commits fully and follows its implications.</comment>
