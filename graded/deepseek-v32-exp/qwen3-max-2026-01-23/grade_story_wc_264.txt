<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, interiority concrete via embodied action, but internal contradiction is minimal by design (dreamlessness). Final endurance earned, with visible cost in emptied mind and burden.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a Charged Poise with cost legible in "chill of his emptied mind" and frozen clock as seed. Orientation clear early, persistent constraint of archive shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory-specific setting (glowing dune, archive, clock) constrains choice (unlit hollows) and charges final image. Micro-setting (archive) actively shapes closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, escalation via density increase and cadence shift; protagonist agency drives spark cultivation with cost in dreamlessness. Stake clear, but conflict is steady rather than dynamic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of light from loss emerges through images (clock as seed, dune bloom) without moralizing. Ending reweights prior material via conceptual repricing (time learning to bloom).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (quantum, light-focused). Voice is poetically controlled, rhythmic under pressure; no head-hopping, elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density, rhythmic prose with varied sentences. No loops or scaffold; figurative language consistent and purposeful, clarity maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic, quantum, and lyric elements. Specific details (archive, wave functions) feel organic; risk-taking in abstract style heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
