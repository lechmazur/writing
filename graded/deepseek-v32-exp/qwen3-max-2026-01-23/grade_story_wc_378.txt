<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Unit Seven's motivation is clear and drives the plot, with interiority concretely rendered through memories and sensory details. However, the lack of contradictory impulses in scene—understandable for an android—slightly limits depth, capping at 8.8 per the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: geomagnetic shift triggers static, motivating the ritual, leading to decisive change. Closure lands with cost in the burning of fears and the ash becoming nutrients, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is integral, with the glass dome and desert rose farm providing resources that constrain choice (sap for lens, atrium for ritual) and charge the final image of the new bud, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resolving inner static—escalates through Unit Seven's agency in the controlled burn, with unmistakable cost in the destruction of fear-objects and the resulting peace, under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of memory, fear, and transformation emerge organically through the ritual; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the new bud and "fragmented wholeness," without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with a distinct perceptual signature: Unit Seven's poetic, sensor-filtered voice is consistent, and rhythmic control heightens pressure without head-hopping or obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and theme, particularly in peak beats like the burning sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of android caretaker and emotional ritual feels inevitable; risk-taking in concept and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure recharges prior material.</comment>
