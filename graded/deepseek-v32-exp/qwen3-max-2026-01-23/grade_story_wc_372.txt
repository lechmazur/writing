<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Character is consistent and motive is clear, but internal contradiction is minimal. The final stance (honoring transition) is earned but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt through embodied struggle. "Her gently meticulous nature compelled her" shows trait-driven action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis of continued work). Cost is legible in the "spent slide" and the endless shelves, but the conceptual price (perpetual sentinel duty) is clearer than a felt, immediate cost. Orientation is immediate and pattern is taught.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is integral, constraining choice (ice-carved workbench, frozen gloom) and charging the final image (frozen sanctuary). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("quartz hush," "frost-rimed aisles"). The library functions as a micro-setting that pressures the protagonist's ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a cadence shift from measuring one vow to facing the endless shelves. The dominant stake (salvaging meaning) tightens as the slide vanishes, forcing the act of preservation. Agency (measuring/logging) forecloses the path of passive loss, with cost in the endless task.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (preservation vs. oblivion, data as elegy) emerges beautifully from concrete action and image, resisting moralizing. The final lines ("she would measure...") offer a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext is rich in the transformation of "spectacle" into "luminous data."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable, close third with a distinct perceptual signature ("quartz hush," "mathematical elegy"). Voice is consistently poetic yet controlled, mirroring the character's meticulousness. No head-hopping. The lyric compression ("For as long as light lingered...") is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is elegant and dense, but risks decorative density in mid-beats ("mathematical elegy for love"). A slight scaffold feel in the final triad ("For as long as..."). Rhythm is purposeful, but a few phrases verge on self-conscious lyricism. No artifacts that obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of archivist, magic, and data is fresh and specific. The core concept is transformed through grounded, technical detail. The emotional truth (finding meaning in preservation) avoids generic templates. However, the central metaphor is somewhat familiar, executed with high competence rather than groundbreaking ingenuity.</comment>
