<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure that earn her final peace. The patchwork metaphor mirrors her internal fragmentation, and her motivation drives every beat without diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost ("Tears fell—not of despair, but release"). Orientation is immediate, and the cryptic phone calls serve the pattern without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through Elara's perception, and the patina bronze censer foot—a micro-setting object—constrains choice and charges the final image, transforming the station from broken to home.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes (navigating grief) escalate through density of memory and ritual under the accumulative lens; agency in building the circuit leads to a legible cost of emotional release and reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme of "reverse migration" emerges organically from particulars, with subtext in objects and actions; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and perceptual signature; Elara's bias shapes every observation, and the lyric compression is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without loops or artifacts; figurative language serves pressure peaks, and sentences advance character and atmosphere with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief, sci-fi, and ritual feels inevitable; the "reverse migration" concept and patchwork navigator transform tropes through specific, risk-taking lyricism.</comment>
