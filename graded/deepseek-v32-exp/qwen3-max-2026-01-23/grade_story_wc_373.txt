<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied, driving consistent micro-choices, but internal contradiction is minimal; she is "curiously steadfast" rather than torn, reducing complexity despite earned closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure lands on-page with cost (the gasp and repair), and the truce of hush as a persistent constraint shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting vividly pressures choices; the watch fob as a recurring object constrains action and charges the ending, with sensory detail filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elara's agency through false starts; cost is unmistakable in the shattered hush and its restoration, tightening options under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of trust breaking/mending emerges from particulars; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice remains consistent under pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dense, lyrical prose with high information density and no artifacts; sentences advance story with clear propulsion, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of concepts (sound capture, false starts) feels inevitable; specific details and risk-taking heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
