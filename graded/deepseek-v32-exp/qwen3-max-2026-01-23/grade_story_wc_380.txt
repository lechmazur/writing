<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in personal loss, driving her quest with concrete interiority via the locket and coffee grounds; the final choice is earned, though contradictory impulses under pressure are not deeply explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal chain from the whale's arrival to memory exhumation is tight; closure lands with cost as the memory is restored and gravity stills, under a clear causal lens with persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid setting constrains choice (fluctuating gravity in the chamber) and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, integrated with POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency; navigating gravity shifts tightens pressure, leading to a climax where cost is unmistakable in the restored memory and equilibrium.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory recovery emerges through images and action; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
