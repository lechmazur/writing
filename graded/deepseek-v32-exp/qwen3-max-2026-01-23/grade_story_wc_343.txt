<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete interiority and actions that align under pressure. However, the character lacks internal contradiction or flawed complexity, keeping her arc positive but somewhat one-note for high literary stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with cost (tears, resonant hum) under a causal lens; orientation is immediate, and the puzzle's constraints shape tactics. The only minor hairline slip is the convenient neatness of the starlings' pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the hopscotch board and phrasebook as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details are filtered through Elara's POV, creating a cohesive atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate via Elara's agency; the cost of her diligent work is felt, and the tightening from observation to action is meaningful under the causal lens. No antagonist, but pressure coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events, with subtext in "stranded luminance" and the final notation offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing, though the notation leans slightly explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice that reflects Elara's perception; no head-hopping, and prose rhythm controls pressure without obscuring clarity. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density, varied rhythm, and no loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with clear propulsion. Minor purple tinge but no muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of airship, starlings cipher, and hopscotch board feels fresh and inevitable, executed with emotional specificity. Lacks bold structural risk, but tropes are transformed through grounded details.</comment>
