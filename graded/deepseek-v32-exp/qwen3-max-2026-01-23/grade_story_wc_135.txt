<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear, rooted in her archivist identity and reactively visionary gift; her micro-choices (cleaning the valve, playing the note) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final warmth and certainty are earned by prior causality, with cost in the emotional labor of confronting loss. Interiority is concrete and embodied, though her emotional progression is linear, lacking contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds across mosaic shards; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the community's reactions and Elara's quiet certainty. Orientation is immediate; transitions are legible; the pattern of staggered intervals is taught early and pays off in the final image of the child's drawing as next interval.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (ivory stones, salt-damp air) and pressures choice: the archive and pier shape actions, and the trumpet valve as micro-setting constrains cleaning and charges the final promise. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's archival POV, avoiding generic catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring community identity) is signaled early; escalation is accumulative through Elara's deliberate acts (note, chart, log), each deepening emotional impact. Cost is legible in exiles' tears and straightened spines. Agency drives each beat, though tension is more healing than high-stakes conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of navigating absences emerges organically through fragmented artifacts and staggered intervals; subtext operates in gestures (the note, the drawing). Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—forging a resilient present by honoring fragments—without moralizing. Epiphany earned through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV (third-person limited) is stable and apt; prose has a distinct lyrical texture with archival precision. Perceptual signature is strong (Elara notices water-bloated ledgers, corroded grooves). Dialogue is minimal but natural; no head-hopping; rhythmic control supports accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied syntax; high information density (lines advance story, character, atmosphere). No loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and coherent. Read-aloud rhythm is strong; sentence-level propulsion matches the accumulative pace.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and organic: archivist with reactively visionary gift heals a community through fragmented restoration. Mosaic structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; emotional specificity avoids generic templates. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in structure supports theme.</comment>
