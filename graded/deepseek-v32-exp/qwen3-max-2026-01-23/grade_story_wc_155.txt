<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied; her pensive mirth shows contradictory impulses in scene, and her final act of leaving the fragment is earned with visible cost in her tearful gratitude.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with legible cost in her transformed inner landscape; accumulative lens holds from start to end; orientation is immediate and clear without penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice—the fog as exposed film is essential to the core concept and directly charges the final image of the luminous bridge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens; cost is unmistakable in her emotional response and the physical embedding of the fragment, tightening the stake.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is consistently artist-filtered; rhythmic control supports pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or scaffolds; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific—light as pigment interacting with fog as film—synthesized into an inevitable emotional arc; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
