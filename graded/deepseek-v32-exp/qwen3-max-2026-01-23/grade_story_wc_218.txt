<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in his role; his calm acceptance of death is consistent, though lacking internal conflict. His actions and interiority are concrete, and his final choice is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost (his life) as the orchard responds; the six-month timeframe and declining health provide persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral to the plot; the temple orchard and living stone pillars constrain choices and charge the final image with renewed connection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through Kael's declining health and the orchard's gradual response; cost is legible in his peaceful death and the restored harmony.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of connection and legacy emerges through action and image; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct perceptual signature; voice is precise and rhythmic, reflecting Kael's meticulous nature; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of botanical, architectural, and spiritual elements; the quiet, accumulative plot feels inevitable and fresh, with specific details that avoid cliché.</comment>
