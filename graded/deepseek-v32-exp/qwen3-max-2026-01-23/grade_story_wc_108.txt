<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's interior conflict between phobia and protective instinct is embodied and drives micro-choices; her final stance is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Slight deduction for occasional label-like phrasing ("transformative betrayal") in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure lands as a decisive change with felt cost ("her own tears falling freely"). Orientation is immediate; the journal discovery is neatly set up, though Silas's arrival timing borders on convenient complication.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is essential: the rusted library's decay triggers phobia, its "rust tears" guide the search, and the open roof becomes the escape. Sensory detail is selective and pressure-driven, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency—decoding, altering the shell—under causal pressure. Cost is legible in the climax (using phobia's hyper-awareness) and the emotional release after Silas flees.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability as power emerges through concrete action and image, but the final paragraph states it explicitly, slightly reducing subtextual resonance. Still, the core reweighting is earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (stunt-double alertness). Dialogue is natural for Lily; voice modulation under stress is controlled, though some phrases edge toward poetic abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied rhythm and high information density. No significant loops or artifacts; figurative language is mostly coherent, though "transformative betrayal" recurs as a near-theme label.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elements (stunt double, whispering shell, child's cast) feels organic and inevitable; emotional specificity elevates familiar tropes, and risk-taking in voice and structure coheres.</comment>
