<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure driving the narrative. However, the lack of contradictory impulses in scene prevents the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with visible cost (the fossil left behind, the map's sacred burden). The accumulative/textural lens holds, and the fossil's discovery meaningfully tightens the stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The coastal cave network is vividly rendered and constrains choice; the elm leaf fossil as a micro-setting object charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and deeply integrated with POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency in discovering and mapping the fossil, leading to a transformative choice with unmistakable cost (leaving the artifact). The dominant stake (preserving memory for awakening) is coherently pressured.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action; the final image (fossil as compass) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to questions of continuity and memory without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice has a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature, with rhythmic control and purposeful compression. No head-hopping; the narrative stance remains consistent and effective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is precise and voice-motivated, sustaining clarity and momentum through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of sensory map-making, post-hibernation world, and factually mystical objects feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
