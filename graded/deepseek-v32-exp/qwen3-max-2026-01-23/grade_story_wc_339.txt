<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aris's characterization is strong with embodied emotion and earned change; his analytical nature and grief are concretely shown through actions like noting the snow globe's physics, leading to a credible shift in the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot coheres under an accumulative lens; closure lands with cost as the stone in his chest settles, orientation is clear early, and structure builds to a resonant reconfiguration through imagery and reflection.</comment>
