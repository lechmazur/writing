<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's face blindness and methodical nature are concretely embodied and drive her quest; her motivation to awaken empathy intensifies and pivots internally upon reading the journal, earning the final choice with visible cost in her tears. The emotional progression is specific and anchored in sensory discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: the ribbon fragment leads to the quarry, methodical search reveals the carving, and the journal provides closure. Orientation is immediate; closure is a decisive change with felt cost in Elara's realization and the reconfigured quarry image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The quarry is a micro-setting that actively constrains choice (moss-slick stones, submerged ledge) and charges the final image, transforming from "tomb of secrets" to "cradle of hard-won peace." Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Elara's tactile perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awakening empathy via truth) escalates through Elara's agency as she discovers the carving and journal, narrowing options and deepening knowledge. Cost is legible in her emotional rupture and the reconfigured mission to present "stone and silk."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of unifying opposites (silk/stone, concealment/truth) emerges organically from particulars and culminates in the final image of fragment against carving, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through the journal's message and the carved mask.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive voice that mirrors Elara's methodical attention. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and heightens pressure during the discovery beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with strong rhythmic control, advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffolds. Minor risk of overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "like a physical lance") but clarity and propulsion remain intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of face blindness, portrait art, and cold-case investigation transforms familiar tropes through specific character logic and thematic depth. The unifying-opposites method feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
