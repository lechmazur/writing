<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Kael's guilt is embodied through productive fidgeting and chess-trained perception; his internal conflict drives micro-choices, and the final acceptance is earned with visible cost in the decoding process.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change—village awakens, guilt untangles—with cost legible in "he had untangled his own guilt"; causal lens holds tight via decoding; orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Frozen village is sensory and constraining; tapestry and labyrinth as micro-settings charge the final image by shaping Kael's tactics and resolution directly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes of absolution escalate through Kael's active winnowing; agency drives the turn, and cost is unmistakable in his restrained tears and the earned peace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of atonement emerges through broken threads and chess knots; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer with "wisdom is woven from broken strands," avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct with chess metaphors and lyrical precision; POV is stable, filtering world through strategy and regret, without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without loops or artifacts; figurative language is consistent, propulsion maintained, and closure image clear with high information density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Synthesis of chess, frozen time, and tapestry decoding feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity or closure.</comment>
