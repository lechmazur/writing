<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Leo's interior contradiction (skepticism vs. urgency) is embodied in scene; his final resolve is earned by the tactile discovery of the valve wheel, with cost visible in the tear and shifted stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds from confession to discovery; closure is a decisive change with cost legible in "true weight settled upon him—not guilt, but grace"; orientation is anchored early, and the valve wheel as persistent constraint shapes the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details (wet stone, rust, light on beads) are selective and purposeful; the tunnel environment and valve wheel pressure Leo's choice and charge the final image with tangible specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (weight of swallowed truth) escalates through Leo's agency; cost is unmistakable in the emotional release and resolve to carry truth out, tightening under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth, memory, and silence emerges from particulars like the beaded wheel; the ending reconfigures "ghost shift" into "truth shift" without moralizing, offering resonant subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (skeptical, alert); voice modulates with pressure, and rhythmic control heightens closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied sentence rhythm and precise imagery; no loops or scaffold, and figurative language ("like a tiny, sorrowful eye") enhances clarity without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story and family secret feels inevitable; specific details (beaded valve wheel, talk-radio calls) transform the trope with emotional truth, and risk-taking heightens stakes.</comment>
