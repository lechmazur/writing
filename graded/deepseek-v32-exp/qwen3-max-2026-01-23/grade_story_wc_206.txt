<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in his unique traits ("wilts near dishonesty"), compelling his high-stakes choice to endure the physical assault of the lie. Interiority is concrete and embodied in fine scars, grime, and the visceral wilt. The final choice—enduring to sing radical acceptance—is earned by prior causality and shows a credible renunciation. Slight deduction as the song's thematic content ("radical acceptance") edges toward diagnostic label-speak in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise) where Kael restores balance, not by destroying midnight but reinstating its necessary place. The cost is legible on the page in his physical collapse and subsequent peace. Orientation is immediate; the pattern of lyrical accumulation is taught and pays off. A persistent constraint (the wilt trait) shapes tactics. Lacks the final, indefinable spark for 9+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The resonance chamber is a perfect micro-setting that constrains and enables the central action—amplifying pure sonic intention. The philosopher's stone chip functions as a key tool, its verdigris glow charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through Kael's professional reverence. The environment decisively shapes the climax and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming dawn's light) is signaled early. Escalation under the accumulative lens is the intensifying physical cost of the lie during the tether-forging, a meaningful deepening that reweights the stake. Kael's agency (turning the key, singing acceptance) drives the resolution. The cost is unmistakable in his buckling knees and tears. The escalation is more internal/textural than causal, limiting the highest band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (covenant of rust, mending the intangible) emerges coherently from concrete particulars—the song of leaves, rivers, iron. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: not destruction but restored balance. Subtext operates in image and implication. Minor risk of thematic statement in phrases like "paradoxical art of mending what isn't torn," but it is anchored in character action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature. The prose's rhythmic control is evident, especially in the climactic tether-forging sequence. Diction is consistently elevated but matches Kael's priestly vocation and the story's tone. No head-hopping or distance issues. The voice is a defining strength, though its density occasionally flirts with obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense, figurative, and pattern-taught, with high information density and varied rhythm. There is a risk of overwriting, but the lyrical mode is sustained and coherent, without mixed metaphors or loops that obscure closure. Minor register drift in peak beats (e.g., "radical acceptance") slightly tempers the score. Overall, the craft supports the accumulative drive and climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a music box repairman, a philosopher's stone chip repurposed for truth, and a "covenant of rust" is a fresh, non-obvious angle on a mythic repair narrative. The core concept is fully committed to and followed through with specific, grounded choices in character and stakes. Lyrical risk-taking heightens meaning without becoming a gimmick. Capped due to Q2 not meeting the 9.0 gate.</comment>
