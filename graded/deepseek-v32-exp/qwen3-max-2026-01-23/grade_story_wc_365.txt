<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies from quiet ache to compassionate redirection; internal conflict between accusation and sacrifice is embodied in sensory perception and micro-choices, earning the final integration with visible cost in the shard as compass.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: initiation via shard resonance leads through parallel universes to a decisive conceptual repricing of Kael's act; closure lands with on-page cost as the shard's purpose reweights Elara's mapmaking, and orientation is anchored within first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned repair bay and green glass shard function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory details are selective, purposeful, and filtered through Elara's professional bias, culminating in the "topography of grace."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering truth escalates under causal lens when the weave turns volatile, forcing Elara's agency to redirect intent from pursuit to compassion; cost is legible in the revelation of Kael's inward redirection and the shard as crystallized sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice, truth, and compassion emerges organically through particulars like the shard's reweighted meaning; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image of "seams of sacrifice and hope" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in sensory mapping; prose rhythm and diction modulate with emotional pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., "murmur of half-remembered dreams") is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical but clear prose with high information density and zero loops or scaffold; figurative language ("skeletal ships drifted like forgotten prayers") is consistent and heightens closure without muddle, and sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory mapmaking and multiverse weaving transforms tropes through specific grounded choices; risk-taking in parallel-universe structure heightens stakes and coherence, and the integration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
