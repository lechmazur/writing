<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is concrete and intensifies under pressure; interiority is embodied through specific actions like discarding assumptions and feeling the shard warm. The final shift from seeker to listener is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her tears and renunciation. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in her tears and decision to remain. Orientation is clear within 120 words. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increase from discarding assumptions leading to cadence shift. Persistent constraint (fragment) shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the spire, lunar perigee, and fragment pressure her tuning. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, charging the final image where the city becomes a "cathedral of resonance." Micro-setting (fragment on dial) alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding beginning in ending) is signaled early; escalation under Accumulative lens via density increase as she discards assumptions. Agency drives tightening, with cost unmistakable in her emotional response and transformation. No coincidence; resolution earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from events and images (silence as origin, beginnings in endings). Subtext operates through shard of hush and tuning process. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; realization reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature: lyrical, precise voice filtered through Elara's professional lens. Rhythmic control under pressure; purposeful elision taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction consistent with character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language supports tone without muddle. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere seamlessly; closure image is crisp with clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Core elements synthesize organically; tropes transformed through specific details like shard of hush and discarding assumptions. Emotional truth is specific; risk-taking in quiet ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
