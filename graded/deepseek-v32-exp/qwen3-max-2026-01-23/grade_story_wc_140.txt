<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies; interiority is concrete and embodied. The final choice to embrace witness is earned by prior accumulation, with visible cost in his hollow identity. Slight passivity in scene action, but consistent with character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds tightly; closure lands as Charged Poise with cost legible in "anchored his own unmoored spirit." Orientation is immediate, and the poison label serves as a keystone that deepens the stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory detail filtered through POV. The shipping containers and tide rhythm constrain his actions and charge the final image as "vessels of memory."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering memory texture) escalates through protagonist's agency in layering fragments; cost is felt in his hollow space. Under accumulative lens, density increase reweights stakes cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of erased histories emerges from particulars, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of witness. No moralizing, subtext in fragments and objects.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature ("filtered reality differently"). Voice is lyrical yet controlled, and syntax reflects his mindset. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, clarity intact even at closure. Sentence variety supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and synthesized through specific detail; risk-taking in accumulative, lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
