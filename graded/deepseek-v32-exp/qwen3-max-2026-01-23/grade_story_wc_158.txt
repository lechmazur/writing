<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular ("reef-shadow joy"). The final peaceful surrender is earned by centuries of depicted resolve. However, internal contradiction is shown more through summary than simultaneous, in-scene impulses, and the mystical resolution slightly mutes the visible cost of his choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens held perfectly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise) with clear, felt cost in the image of longing "woven into this radiant tapestry." Orientation is immediate and precise; the shell's resonance provides the decisive reweighting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell and galaxy postcard are indispensable, constraining existence and charging the final image with living light. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and deeply filtered through the poet's timeless POV. The micro-setting is the story's engine.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a clean, decisive intensification: the wind shifts, the shell resonates. The protagonist's agency (his persistent lullabies) drives the change. The cost—centuries of longing acknowledged, not erased—is legible and charges the final peace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of alchemizing pain into beauty emerges entirely through image and action ("photosynthesize pain into beauty"). The "blossom armistice" is realized non-literally in the shell's luminescent response. No moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, ambiguous answer through the final, transformed duet.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable, deeply interior, and the poetic perceptual signature is distinct and consistent ("smooth as forgotten promises"). The lyrical voice modulates with emotional beats without losing coherence. Purposeful compression and elevated diction are fully voice-motivated and pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly controlled, with rhythmic variation. There is a risk of overwriting ("reef-shadow joy" is a conceptually strained metaphor), but the figurative language is generally coherent and serves the accumulative drive. No loops or scaffolding; momentum is sustained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise—an insomniac poet in a symbiotic, centuries-long dialogue with a galactic shell—is strikingly original and fully committed. The synthesis of elements feels inevitable, transforming a simple metaphor into a specific, lived reality. The lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes and coherence.</comment>
