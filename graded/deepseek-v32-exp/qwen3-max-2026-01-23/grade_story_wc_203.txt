<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Leo's characterization is concrete and his motivation drives the plot; his calm, observant nature is consistently shown through micro-choices, and his final vow is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly; orientation is immediate, closure is a decisive change with felt cost (ghost's peace, Leo's vow), and the constraint of the dying light shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choice—the crack, dust patterns, and dying light all constrain Leo's actions and charge the final image of hidden love.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake escalates through Leo's agency; the ghost's plea forces a tightening, and cost is legible in the ghost's release and Leo's assumed burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hidden love and burdens emerges organically through images (cracks, barrels) and the final resonant image of the photograph as a "tiny sun" avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm and selective attention reflect Leo's professional eye, and elision (ghost's miming) is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied syntax and no loops; figurative language is precise and supports closure without muddle or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-seeing and repair work transforms the trope; specific details (dust analysis, mainspring barrel) feel organic and heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
