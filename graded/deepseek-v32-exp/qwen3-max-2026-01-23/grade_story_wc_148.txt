<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is sacred and well-rooted in his legacy; internal conflict shown through embodied actions; final change earned with Elias's belief carrying visible cost in tear and restored trust.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation clear by first paragraph; closure lands with decisive change—Elias sees truth, tear shows cost—and persistent constraint of Kael's legacy shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting vividly pressures choices: lighthouse prison confines, door and lattice constrain action and charge final image; sensory details like "copperlight repose" are filtered through Kael's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth acknowledged) escalates via Kael's agency using the lattice; cost is legible in Elias's tear and the "quiet weight of trust restored," foreclosing doubt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth and legacy emerges through concrete images (lattice, scuffs); ending offers resonant, non-literal answer with "son of the boy who cried wolf finally rested."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical and controlled, anchored in Kael's POV; dialogue natural and goal-driven; perceptual signature distinct with "copperlight" and "hush" motifs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without loops or scaffold; figurative language purposeful ("copperlight repose"); line-level propulsion advances story and clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "boy who cried wolf" legacy with lighthouse prison and confessional lattice; specific details feel inevitable; lyrical risk enhances stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
