<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's calm empathy and purposeful shift from listening to eliciting laughter are concretely embodied; her motivation drives the healing with visible cost in the bittersweet release. However, internal contradiction is minimal, keeping the characterization from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Cora's release) with felt cost ("bittersweet weight"); the misaligned harp and crocodile tooth persistently shape tactics, and orientation is immediate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through Elara's perception; the gorge's acoustics and the tools (harp, tooth) constrain choice and charge the final image of cleansed silence, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake is healing Cora; escalation is driven by Elara's agency in shifting from dissonant notes to playful laughter, reweighting the stake with unmistakable cost in the "luminous ache" of release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—integration of laughter into healing—emerges through specific actions (badger tapestry, crocodile story) and the final image, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice; perception is character-specific, and dialogue (minimal) carries subtext; no head-hopping, and elision (e.g., Cora's past) is anchored in present cues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, even in peak beats, without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of a soul collector using dissonant harp and laughter is a fresh, organic synthesis; specific details (crocodile tooth, badger tapestry) feel inevitable and heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
