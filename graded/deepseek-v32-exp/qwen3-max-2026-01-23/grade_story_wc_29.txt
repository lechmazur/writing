<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dr. Thorne's motivation and cautious hope are clear and consistent, driving his risky broadcast. Interiority is conveyed through embodied emotion (tears, steady hands) and micro-choices under pressure, though internal contradiction is more stated than dramatized in scene. The final endurance is earned, with cost legible in Dean's approach.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: because of the tricksters' signal and Dean's threat, Aris broadcasts a counter-frequency, leading to a temporary calming. Closure is a resonant Charged Poise—the community breathes again, but the tricksters will adapt and Croft approaches—with on-page cost in the footsteps and the need to rebuild.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The radio-station basement is vividly rendered through selective sensory detail (green glow, hum, dust motes). The astronomical charts and transmitter are not just backdrop; they constrain choice and charge the final image, their glow a promise kept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stop cosmic-driven discord) escalates via Dean's termination threat, forcing Aris's audacious broadcast. Agency drives the climax; cost is unmistakable in the tears, altered quad, and impending confrontation. One meaningful tightening under the causal lens suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of fighting manipulation with compassionate resonance emerges organically from concrete action. The final paragraph's explicit statement ("not through power, but through precise, compassionate interference") verges on moralizing, slightly undercutting the earned, non-lateral resonance of the prior image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature blending scientific precision and poetic wonder. Diction and syntax remain character-bound and controlled under pressure, sustaining the 'ethereal grit' tone without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmically varied, advancing story with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("dust motes danced," "silent scream") is purposeful and clear; sentence-level propulsion matches scene urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cosmic horror and campus drama feels organic and inevitable. The concept of subsonic psychic warfare is fresh, grounded in specific detail and character expertise, transforming the trope of the lone scholar into a resonant stand against manipulation.</comment>
