<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied; her motivation to understand endings drives micro-choices under pressure, and her final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the clinic decision and community connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with cost legible in her transformed perspective; orientation is clear early, and the journal discovery tightens stakes without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory details (ice groan, aurora) are selective and purposeful; the drift-ice marina and parasol tip constrain choices and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate for environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learning endings) escalates via accumulative density; protagonist agency in trawling and listening leads to a deepening where cost is felt in her reconfigured motivation and decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (parasol tip, ice cracks, journal); the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material with emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; lyrical prose modulates rhythm under pressure, and any elision (e.g., time jumps) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purpose-driven, and sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of euthanasia tourism with Arctic disaster relief; specific details (parasol tip, fold in patience) feel inevitable, and risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
