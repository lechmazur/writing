<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's motivation and embodied emotion are clear, with micro-choices under pressure, but internal contradiction is limited; final choice is earned with visible cost in the healed sky and emotional release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly; closure lands with cost as the sky heals and the sundial lid glows, anchored early with no orientation debt; persistent constraint of chess pieces shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory setting constrains choice and charges the final image; icebound spire and fractured time pressure actions and integrate with climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Kael's agency in swapping pieces, each step tightening stakes with legible cost in sky changes and spire groans; cost unmistakable on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of restoration emerges from action, but final paragraph edges toward moralizing with "greatest theft was giving back," slightly reducing resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable POV with distinct perceptual signature; lyrical prose reflects Kael's reverence, and rhythmic control supports pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dense, figurative prose with no loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies naturally, clarity maintained in peak beats, and information density advances story.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy tropes through specific details like chess pieces and sundial lid; concept feels inevitable in hindsight with moderate risk-taking.</comment>
