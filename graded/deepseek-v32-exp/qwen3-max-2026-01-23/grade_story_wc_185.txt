<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation deepens credibly from duty to visceral imperative, with embodied emotion in the tear and hammered repose. However, internal contradiction is minimal, limiting complexity; his steadfast pursuit lacks conflicting impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal plot with clear orientation early; closure lands decisively with the bloom of hush, cost legible in "tear traced a clean path" and "hammered repose." The ice and stone persistently shape tactics, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: harmonic caves and glacial heart constrain choice via ice crack patterns and charge the final image with a luminous map. Sensory detail is selective and woven through action, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to find quiet escalates through Kael's agency—examining cracks, placing the stone—with cost unmistakable in emotional release and earned calm. Escalation tightens under causal lens without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as foundational harmony emerges through concrete images like the bloom of hush and ripple-marks, with a resonant, non-literal ending that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature as mapkeeper; poetic prose maintains rhythmic control and clarity under pressure, and any elision is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats, and propulsion supports causality and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sonic topography, energy beings, and the bloom of hush feels inevitable, with specific details like the echo chamber stone and crack patterns transforming tropes through grounded, risk-taking execution.</comment>
