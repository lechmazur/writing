<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in trait-consistent micro-choices; his shift from transactional to transformative is earned by the locket discovery and prior debt. Liam provides secondary pressure with embodied emotion. No contradictory impulses in scene, but final choice has visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under a causal lens; cost is legible in Elias's expanded worldview and the en route ripple of gratitude. Orientation is clear within 120 words; the mistaken address and locket create tight because/therefore linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and selective, with the garden and bench charging the final image under starlight. However, it does not tightly constrain choices; micro-setting objects (locket, envelope) drive the plot more than environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uplifting silent contributors) escalates through protagonist agency: Elias initiates the rebellion after finding the locket and meeting Liam. Cost is felt in his realization that moving hearts is transformative, foreclosing his purely transactional view.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of cycles of compassion emerges organically from actions and images, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the note's departure and Elias's cautious exuberance. Subtext operates in gestures like the locket clasp yielding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (broker's precision filtering notice). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven; voice coherence holds under pressure, though some phrasing leans slightly decorative.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language ("logistics of the soul") is purposeful and clear. Sentence variety supports momentum, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of unseen labor and compassion cycles through specific details (cargo broker, locket, mistaken address). Risk-taking in quiet, character-driven resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry, though premise is familiar.</comment>
