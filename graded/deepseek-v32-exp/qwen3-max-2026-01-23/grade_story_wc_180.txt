<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation and internal conflict are concrete and embodied; her final choice to use the ribbon is earned by the memory of Lyra's words, with visible emotional cost. The daughter's arrival tests and reconfigures the relationship, fulfilling the "relationships as crucible" requirement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Elara's discovery of the ribbon directly leads to the mending method and Lyra's arrival. Closure is a decisive change in their relationship, cost felt in the tears and whispered hope. Orientation is immediate; the breach of contract backstory is efficiently anchored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard setting is vividly sensory and actively constrains choice (broken window requires mending) and charges the final image (ribbon woven into new growth). Micro-setting (the bag, the ribbon) functions as environment that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridging generational wisdom) escalates through Elara's agency: her persistence, discovery, and method each tighten options. The cost is legible in the emotional risk and the ribbon's transformation into a "deciduous vow."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of "deciduous vows" emerges organically through action and image, resisting moralizing. The final dialogue articulates the concept explicitly, slightly reducing subtextual resonance, but the ribbon's reprise and the orchard's reclamation provide a non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature filtered through Elara's professional eye. Diction and rhythm modulate with emotional beats; dialogue is natural and goal-driven when it appears.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and no scaffold or loops. Figurative language ("amber tears," "skeletal rafters") is consistent and purposeful; rhythm supports the contemplative yet feisty tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of quartz-eye mender, reclaimed cathedral, and ribbon-as-bridge feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical density and conceptual metaphor heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the core premise is transformed through specific, grounded detail.</comment>
