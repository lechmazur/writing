<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's reluctance and duty are embodied in concrete actions and micro-choices; her endurance is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the final stasis. Interiority avoids stock phrasing, and contradictions (reluctance vs. precision) act simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages from oath to assembly to rescue. Orientation is immediate; closure lands as Earned Stasis with felt cost—her bound continuation—shaped by persistent constraints (frost, oath).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting pressures choices (frost, labyrinth, birds) and charges the final image; sensory details (clockwork ticking, glittering frost) are selective and filtered through Elara's urgency. Micro-setting (altar, nut) constrains assembly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide travelers before frost) tightens via time pressure; escalation is agency-driven under causal lens, with cost legible in her relief and continued bondage. One meaningful turn (finding nut) narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of graceless beauty emerges from specifics (rusty joints, crude wire) and reweights the ending without moralizing. Subtext in images like "stubborn grace" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to duty vs. freedom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature (offhandedly exact precision); voice is controlled and consistent, modulating with pressure. No head-hopping; elision (blueprint details) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("twilight bled into violet") serves clarity; no overwriting or register drift in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cursed orchard, mechanical birds, and blood-oath feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric precision under pressure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; transformation of tropes through specific detail.</comment>
