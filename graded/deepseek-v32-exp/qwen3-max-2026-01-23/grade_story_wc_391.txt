<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through concrete, embodied emotion (e.g., "impatience hummed like a trapped bird"). Her final choice to press the sigil is earned by prior causality and years of waiting, foreclosing a path with visible cost. However, some interiority edges toward diagnostic labeling (e.g., "alchemical transformation"), slightly abstracting the internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost (seven winters of vigilance). The accumulative/textural lens is held throughout, building through descriptive layers to the sigil's activation and the moss's emergence. Orientation is anchored early, and the pattern of celestial tracking is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary and frozen lake are not just vivid backdrops but constrain choice and charge the final image. The magnetic viaduct and ice altar are integral to the climax. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Elara's professional POV, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (patient revolution vs. haste) is signaled early and escalates under the accumulative lens through increasing descriptive density and the approaching celestial alignment. The cost is legible in Elara's sustained vigil and the precise, irreversible moment of activation. Agency is clear in her final gesture of surrender.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete events and images (moss on ice, tracked moon paths). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Slight deduct for occasional explicit thematic statements ("a patient revolution") that approach prompt-like language, though they are largely woven into the narrative fabric.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct lyrical, observational voice that reflects Elara's role. Psychic distance is controlled, and the perceptual signature is strong. No head-hopping; purposeful compression and elision are taught and paid off in the closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density and varied rhythm. Some figurative language risks mild overwriting but does not obscure causality or the closure image. No significant loops, scaffolding, or register drift. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative build.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of a "patient revolution" achieved through celestial mapping and environmental synergy is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Specific, grounded details (basalt instruments, magnetic viaduct) create a memorable vision. The story commits fully to its premise, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
