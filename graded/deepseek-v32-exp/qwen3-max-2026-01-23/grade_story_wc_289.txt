<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her from solitude to creation. Interiority is concrete through her perception of secrets and the spiral, though internal conflict is subtle rather than sharply contradictory. Her final choice to place "home" feels earned by prior causality, with cost in solitude replaced by kinship.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly: the spiral catalyzes an installation that accumulates offerings, leading to a resonant reconfiguration where Elara feels woven into a "luminous web." Closure lands on-page with felt cost in "solitude replaced by quiet kinship," and orientation is anchored early without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory detail (wet stone, lotus scent) and actively constrains choice: the pond supplies materials, the temple reflection acknowledges the find. The environment charges the final image of the installation as a "shimmering truth," meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (connection) escalates through Elara's agency in creating the installation and the accumulative density of strangers' secrets. One meaningful tightening occurs when she places her own secret, with cost legible in her transformed solitude. Gentle but coherent under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of connection and rejoin emerges organically through images (spiral, web) and action, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in "rejoin was not an event, but a gentle, ongoing practice," with subtext in the shared tapestry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a lyrical perceptual signature filtered through Elara's sensitivity to secrets and beauty. Voice modulates with emotional beats (e.g., "heart swelling") without head-hopping or register drift, and rhythmic control supports the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with poetic figurative language ("prismatic quiet," "luminous web") that never muddles sense. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, information advances story and atmosphere, and no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts obscure closure. Masterful line-level craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of love letter ghostwriter, found object, and public art installation feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative plot heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity (thrush's spiral, lotus stems) anchors emotional truth with memorable vision.</comment>
