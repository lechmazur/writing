<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elara's interior conflict between skepticism and kindness is embodied in concrete choices, driving her to activate the tile and transcribe visions with visible cost; contradictory impulses act in scene, and final renunciation is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal plot tightens from discovery to alignment under inferred lens; closure lands with Liam's solace and tile cooling, cost felt in emotional surrender and conceptual repricing of connection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tower and migration setting constrain action through meridian line and constellation; sensory details like "salt-laced wind" charge the final image of the humming sanctuary, essential to choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency with the tile; cost is legible in her tears and the tile's fulfillment, foreclosing skepticism via one meaningful tightening under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of entangled resilience emerges through specific visions of whales and stargazers; ending reweights silence and connection without moralizing, though slight explicitness in "true reflection" line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical, perceptual signature; prose rhythm modulates with emotional pressure, no head-hopping; elision taught and paid off in forgotten patterns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dense, figurative language advances story without loops or artifacts; syntax varies naturally, clarity intact at closure; high information density with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stargazer, whales, and memory feels inevitable; risk in lyrical depth heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming tropes through specific detail.</comment>
