<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions; interiority shown via heart rhythms and struggle. However, internal contradiction is minimal, slightly limiting depth. Final choice earned by prior causality with visible cost in torn fingers and emotional release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a decisive change with cost legible in physical pain and orchard's transformation. Orientation immediate, plot progresses via because/therefore linkages. Persistent constraint of mechanical world shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting vividly pressures choices—orchard and statues force action; locust shell and monolith as micro-settings constrain decisions and charge final image. Sensory details selective and purposeful, woven through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake escalates through Elara's agency; her choices to play, descend, and uproot tighten options with unmistakable cost. Pressure coheres under causal lens, leading to closure with felt trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of breaking free emerges through images like locust shell and heart rhythms; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in transformation and vulnerability charges the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature filters setting through Elara's bias. No head-hopping; elision taught and paid off in closure. Rhythmic control supports pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose dense and rhythmic; information high without padding. Slight repetition of "resonantly soft" is purposeful, no loops or artifacts harm clarity. Figurative language consistent and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable; risk-taking in heart-rhythm method heightens stakes. Tropes transformed through specific details like locust shell and tarnished wonder. Fresh angle on magical realism.</comment>
