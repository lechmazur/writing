<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's motivation (atonement for his sister) is clear, rooted in his past, and intensifies under pressure. His internal conflict—between his destructive history and reverent present—is embodied in micro-choices like handling the tapestry fragment "with volcanic tenderness." The final act of copying the canticle is an earned renunciation of his past ideology, though the emotional articulation occasionally edges toward poetic summary ("tears, hot as embers yet gentle as dew").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong accumulative/textural drive lens held throughout: the trail of artifacts builds a pattern of loss and renewal culminating in the Conceptual Repricing of the vandalized portrait. Closure lands on-page with clear cost (Kael's tears, his vow of atonement) and transforms the premise. Orientation is immediate; structure is a single, coherent shard with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The archive is vividly rendered through selective, POV-filtered sensory detail ("dust-choked floor," "lantern beam"). It functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice (Kael must interpret its silent language) and decisively charges the final image of the star-dusted chamber. Some description borders on lushness but remains purposeful and integrated with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through increasing density and symbolic weight of the artifacts, tightening toward the pivotal "portray" moment. The dominant stake (healing the valley) is signaled early and tested through Kael's analytical intuition. His agency in humming the scar-notes triggers the resolution with a visible emotional cost and a foreclosed path (his past identity).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (reconstruction vs. destruction, scars as song) emerges organically through concrete images and Kael's arc. The subversion of "vandalism" into "portrayal" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The final image of the "green shoot" of redemption avoids moralizing, though one line ("true liberation was not in burning cages...") leans slightly toward explicit thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable, close third-person filtered through Kael's analytically intuitive mind, creating a distinct perceptual signature. Voice is lyrical yet precise, modulating with emotional pressure. Diction remains within his plausible lexicon, and the patterned use of phrases like "volcanic tenderness" feels taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and largely propulsive, with strong information density. Minor overwriting in a few metaphoric clusters ("tears, hot as embers yet gentle as dew") risks mixed sensation but does not obscure causality or closure. No repetitive scaffolds or loops. Sentence-level control supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis: the conceit of a vandalized self-portrait encoding a healing song transforms the familiar redemption quest. The specific angle of an arsonist-turned-preserver feels organic and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking with lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes and coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
