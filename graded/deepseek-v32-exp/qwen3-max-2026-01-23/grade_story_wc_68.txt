<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is crystalline and contradictory impulses act in scene during his agony over the tablet. His final choice to hide it is earned by prior causality with visible cost in his silent endurance. Embodied emotion ("hands trembled") and micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values. No stock phrasing or diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis with felt cost in Kael's acceptance of his custodian role. Causal lens holds tightly: discovery leads to decision via rational weighing. Orientation is clear within 120 words. Persistent constraint (surface myth) shapes tactics, and cost is legible in "Preservation demanded patience, not proclamation."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through Kael's POV with selective sensory detail. The sedimentary layers method and the chronometer cog constrain choices and charge the final image. World rules are consistent, and spatial choreography is coherent. The sunken city ruins pressure tactics and supply resources.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving truth vs. surface narrative) is signaled early and tightens with the tablet's discovery. Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the causal lens, forcing a decision that forecloses immediate revelation with cost. The trade-off between revelation and silence is unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete actions and images, such as the cog as "anchor of objective reality." Subtext operates through implication, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: truth as a seed for future ground. No thematic echo or prompt-like language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: philosophical, precise, and reflective. Voice modulates with emotional intensity without head-hopping. Diction remains within Kael's lexicon, and rhythmic control supports pressure. No dialogue, but interiority is coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere. Purposeful repetition ("abrasive calm") serves motif. Read-aloud ear test passes smoothly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic knowledge preservation with specific details like the chronometer cog and sedimentary method. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices. Emotional truth in Kael's solitude feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
