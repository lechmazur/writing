<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is concrete with embodied interiority; claustrophobia and prudent adventure drive micro-choices under pressure. Final organ-playing choice earned by prior causality (journal fragment, fear vs. duty) with visible cost in tears and realization. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictory impulses act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost ("Tears traced clean paths..."). Causal lens holds tightly; spatial mutiny constraint shapes tactics throughout. Orientation clear by ~120 words; journal recall anchored in present stimulus. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and POV-filtered; nexus and organ constrain choices and charge final image. Spatial mutiny is integral to conflict, altering options. Micro-setting (compass, organ) pressures tactics. No generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find Chronos Key) signaled early; escalation via spatial pressure and protagonist's agency (playing organ). Cost legible in claustrophobic struggle and village risk. Resolution earned through understanding, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of resonant rebellion emerges through particulars (organ reverberation, spatial harmony). Ending reweights prior material with image of "resonant chord, not a clenched fist" without moralizing. Subtext in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature reflects Elara's cautious exploration. Rhythm controls pressure peaks; no head-hopping or distance slips. Diction remains character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose dense and figurative but purposeful; no loops, scaffold, or paraphrase cycles. Sentence variety supports rhythm; information density high. Slight elevated diction in peak beats but clarity intact, no artifact harm to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of exploration tropes with spatial mutiny and organ resonance. Specificity in details (compass, key) feels organic. Emotional truth in claustrophobia overcome; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
