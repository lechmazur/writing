<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her traits; her retrocognitive blessing and thistle-blown hope drive micro-choices under pressure. Interiority is concrete via embodied actions like tracing fractures and trembling hands. The final choice to rekindle the beacon is earned by thirty years of tracking and a vision, with cost visible in her tears. Minor deduction for lack of deep internal contradiction, but overall strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: her preparations lead to the precise alignment and rekindling. Orientation is immediate, closure is a decisive change with felt cost (tears, answering lights). The vision of Master Aris reinforces causality without breaking it. No plot amnesia or convenience; the ending lands with resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—glass humming pavilion, obsidian dais, constellations etched on walls—and actively constrains choice: the hum deepens with alignment, the prism fragments require precise handling. Sensory detail (thrumming, cool silver light) is selective and POV-filtered. The environment charges the final image of rekindled light and answering lanterns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving meaning in coincidences) escalates through Elara's agency: tracking stars, ascending at twilight, using the shard of hush. Cost is legible in her emotional release and the valley's response. Under causal lens, tightening occurs via because/therefore linkages (alignment demands precise action). No coincidence resolves; her earned success forecloses doubt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events: hope, meaning, and dialogue across time. Subtext in images like "thistle-blown hope" and the shard's silence. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"every coincidence is a whisper of meaning"—without moralizing. Slight explicitness in final line, but earned through prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature: Elara's retrocognitive blessing filters perception poetically. Voice is lyrical yet controlled, e.g., "thistle-blown hope." No head-hopping; diction matches her mindset. Elision (vision sequence) is taught and pays off. Dialogue absent, so not evaluated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without artifacts; lines advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language ("thistle-blown hope," "symphony of light") is consistent and clear. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Information density high, propulsion steady to closure. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic custodian, celestial alignment, and retrocognitive magic feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes transformed through specific details like the shard of hush and glass pavilion. Emotional truth anchors ingenuity; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative echoes.</comment>
