<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Leo's interior contradiction—insulating with facts versus embracing emotion—acts in scene, and his final choice to chronicle unsung stories is earned by the memory of authentic service. Embodied emotion (trembling fingers, tears of release) and micro-choices (lifting the lid, writing) reveal character under pressure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change: Leo abandons auction houses to become a chronicler, with cost legible in "tears welled, not of shame, but of release." Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of detail and memory, reconfiguring the echo valley longing into potential.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (quarry trailer, limestone cliffs) and object (speaker grille cloth) charge the final image; selective sensory details ("floorboards groaning a specific C-sharp," "amber in the sunset") mirror internal states and constrain choice via the scrap's journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose after loss) escalates under Accumulative lens through Leo's agency—stopping the ritual, letting memory flow—to a tightening that forecloses his old path. Cost is unmistakable in his emotional release and decision to pursue unapplauded service.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the scrap as testament to craft, not glory. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "echo in the valley was not of faded applause, but of potential," avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—professional appraisal terms blend with lyrical reflection—and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; voice modulates from factual to emotional with purpose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("solitary sentinel," "echo valley longing") is consistent and clear; sentence-level propulsion accelerates the internal turn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ex-roadie appraiser and speaker grille cloth transforms redemption tropes through specific, grounded detail. Risk-taking in internal focus heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
