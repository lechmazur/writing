<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's accidentally prophetic nature creates immediate internal conflict; his guarded care and subsequent laugh demonstrate contradictory impulses. His final "shadowed elation" is earned through disciplined steering, with cost felt in solitude.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain from prophetic laugh to storm to steering is tight; closure lands with the fading glyphs, a decisive change that integrates storm into dawn, cost legible in the "poignant solitude."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse and glass wick are not just backdrop but constrain choice; the wick's total internal reflection is essential for painting calm, and the final glyphs on sand charge the image with lasting impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake is to shape dawn; escalation driven by Kael's agency when his laugh summons the storm he must then steer. Cost is visible in his sweat and the ephemeral glyphs, confirming a meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of weaving ancient shadows into new dawn emerges through concrete actions—steering light to cast glyphs—without moralizing. The final image of peace in the cove offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV firmly anchored in Kael's perception; voice is poetic yet precise, with rhythm modulating from calm to storm to resolution. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., mentor's quote) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "wind began to keen its rising song" serves momentum. Sentence variety and selective detail advance story and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of storm herald, prophetic flaw, and light-steering mechanics feels inevitable; risk-taking in poetic diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure is fully integrated.</comment>
