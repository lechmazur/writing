<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied; her motivation to restore lost faith intensifies under pressure, culminating in an earned reconnection. The final choice to rebuild the sundial arises from prior causality with visible cost (tear, felt veil). Contradictory impulses (doubt/enchantment) are present but could be more simultaneous in scene; minor hairline slip keeps from 9.5.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with on-page cost (tear, thinned veil). Orientation is immediate; the sundial base as persistent constraint shapes tactics. No causality breaks; the ending reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice (roots, sundial base, sapling). The catacomb orchard charges the final image and pressures tactics. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's perception, woven into action. No postcard description; environment is indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore faith) escalates through protagonist agency under accumulative lens: discovery of sundial base triggers decision to rebuild. Cost is legible (emotional surrender, commitment). One meaningful tightening (shadow alignment) forecloses other paths with felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of interrupted journeys emerges through particulars (exile, sundial, roots) without statement. Final image (shadow touching tomb) offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior material. No moralizing; subtext operates in gesture and image. Earned wisdom from concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited with consistent lyrical voice. Perceptual signature is distinct (noticing roots, light, silence). No head-hopping; psychic distance is stable. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and elision (elder's charge) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense but controlled; figurative language serves closure without muddle. Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Information density high; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting risk in peak beats but does not obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of diaspora return, catacomb orchard, and sundial ritual feels inevitable. Specific, grounded details (roots cradling bones, gnomon shaping) avoid template. Risk-taking in lyrical density heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation of tropes through character-specific choices.</comment>
