<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied emotion; insight earned through concrete actions and vision; change credible with visible cost (tears). Minor abstraction in epiphany statement is the only flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Clear orientation, causal progression, and decisive change with felt cost; lens (causal) holds; closure resonates and reconfigures purpose. Persistent constraint (canyon, flute) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details filtered through POV; canyon constrains choice and charges final image; "avalanchingly quiet" motif deepens resonance. Environment essential to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Internal stake clear and escalates via protagonist's agency (playing flute); cost legible in emotional release; vision forces confrontation that tightens stakes. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from ritual and vision; final image offers non-literal answer (yielding like a reed). Slight explicit statement earned by concrete experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with lyrical, character-filtered prose; distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. No head-hopping; voice consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Polished prose with high information density, varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts. Figurative language purposeful and clear; propulsion maintained through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy and introspective character study; specific details (driftwood, flute) create memorable vision. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
