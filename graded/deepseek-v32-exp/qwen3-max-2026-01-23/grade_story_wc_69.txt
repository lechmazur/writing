<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara's expectant resignation is embodied and drives micro-choices; relationships change credibly through subtracted silences, with cost visible in her tear and melted posture at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchored early; accumulative lens holds as repeated subtraction of noise builds to a resonant reconfiguration where the rosette denotes continuity, with cost legible in the final image of shared breath.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The velvet library and autumn setting are vividly sensory and constrain action; the rosette as micro-setting charges the final image by reweighting from loss to continuity, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of braiding voices escalates through Elara's agency in subtracting noise; cost is unmistakable in the unlearning of hatred and the tear during Anya's support of Liam.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of harmony through subtraction emerges from particulars like the rosette and silence; the ending offers a non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV of Elara is stable with a lyrical perceptual signature; voice modulates from resigned to awed, supporting the accumulative design without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "traveled stillness" is pattern-taught and pays off at closure, with high information density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of subtracting noise for harmony is fresh; specific details like the zither rosette and velvet library create an organic synthesis that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
