<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted, with interior contradiction (awe vs. solitude). Her micro-choices (offering partnership, dedicating her sculpture) reveal values under pressure. Kael applies secondary pressure. A slight deduction for the abstract "luminescent ache," which edges toward diagnostic label-speak in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is coherent and held. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost (Kael's weeping, the shared ache). Orientation is clear early. The search pattern is taught and pays off, though the final discovery relies slightly on Kael's pointing, not Elara's agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressure-laden; the crystalline orchard and crater shape the search and final image. The marsh-reed and obsidian arbor function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the closure with tangible, contrasting textures.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a density increase through the shared search and the revelation of the tag. The dominant stake (belonging) tightens meaningfully. Cost is legible in Kael's release and Elara's dedication. However, the final turn (finding the tag) is slightly passive, discovered rather than decisively acted upon.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of connection emerges organically through the search, the glyph, and the woven arbors. Subtext operates in gesture and object (the reed arbor placed at the obsidian base). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids the "Thematic Echo" trap.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; Elara's poetic, reverent filtering is consistent. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (Kael's exposition, Elara's offer). Prose rhythm and syntax modulate effectively with emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythmic control. Information density is high. Minor deduction for occasional overwrought phrasing ("luminescent ache," "star-flecked shadow") which, while voice-coherent, slightly blurs immediacy in peak beats. No scaffold or loop artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a mystical quest, street-art ritual, and ecological art feels fresh and specific. The core premise is transformed through grounded character choices and a quiet, earned emotional arc. Risk-taking in lyrical style coheres without gimmickry.</comment>
