<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interior contradiction between control and acceptance is embodied in concrete micro-choices (e.g., hands tightening vs. tear of release). Her final shift from commander to companion is earned by prior causality—the linden leaf observation and memory of the bent oak—with visible cost in relinquished repair rituals.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost (walking away without repair, observing with patience). Causal lens holds: because she sees the leaf and reflects, she alters her tactics. Orientation is anchor early; mosaic shards (after storm, days later) are legible and cohere under the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (mossy trellis, linden leaf) actively constrains choice and charges the final image—the trellis’s moss shifts from decay to collaboration, shaping Elara’s realization. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (boots sinking, mist curling).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (control vs. acceptance) escalates through protagonist agency: the linden leaf triggers a tightening that forecloses her old path of frantic reconstruction. Cost is legible in her release of control, altering subsequent choices like leaving the willow branch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of transformation through acceptance emerges from particulars (linden leaf, bent oak) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the image of "graceful, enduring flow," reweighting prior material without stated thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, nature-focused interiority. Dialogue with Mrs. Higgins carries subtext and character-specific idiom. No head-hopping; voice modulates purposefully under emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("emerald velvet," "whispered secret") is consistent and clear. Sentence-level propulsion varies with scene needs, and peak beats avoid muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Familiar theme of acceptance is made fresh through specific synthesis—nursery setting, linden leaf object, and moss-as-collaboration metaphor. Risk-taking in lyrical, internal focus heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
