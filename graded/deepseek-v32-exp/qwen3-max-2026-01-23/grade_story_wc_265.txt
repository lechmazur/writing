<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and drives choices, with embodied emotion and earned change. Lacks strong internal contradiction in scene, but final choice is causally earned with visible cost in peace and expansion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (gear insertion and mind expansion) under a causal lens, cost legible in peace and harmony. Orientation is immediate, and structure tightens with because/therefore linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and filters through POV, with the mechanical rainforest actively constraining choices (wind sounds guide path) and charging the final image (obsidian tree and gear socket).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rediscovering the mind) escalates via agency under causal lens: listening to wind, navigating, inserting gear. Cost is legible in overcome anxiety and gained wonder, though not a sharp loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of collaborative self-discovery emerges through concrete images (gears, wind songs) without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal reweighting: mind as frontier to be tended, not tamed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (mechanical-sensory focus) and rhythmic control. Voice is consistently poetic and purposefully compressed, enhancing pressure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative but clear, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language coheres within the world, and closure beats remain sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes mechanical rainforest, sixth sense, and translocation with specificity; turns feel inevitable from established pattern. Risk-taking in lyric abstraction heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
