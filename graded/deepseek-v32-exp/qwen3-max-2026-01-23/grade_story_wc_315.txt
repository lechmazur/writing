<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in a past failure; her interiority is concrete and emotions embodied. The final choice to revise is earned with visible cost (tear, memory).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain from observation to revision is tight; closure lands with a decisive change (trust restored) and cost is legible in the tear and relief; orientation is immediate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The arbor is not just backdrop but a tool that constrains choice (as corrective lens) and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving trust) are signaled early and escalate through memory and wrongness; agency drives the revision with a clear cost (emotional weight).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of trust and redemption emerges through images (buckle, stars) without moralizing; the ending reweights prior material with a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is pattern-seeking; no head-hopping; diction and rhythm control heighten pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and clear; information density is high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sky-watcher and personal redemption; the arbor as lens and buckle transformation feel organic and inevitable; risk-taking in quiet conflict pays off.</comment>
