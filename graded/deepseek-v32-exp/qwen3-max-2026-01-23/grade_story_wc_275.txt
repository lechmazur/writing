<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure via Earned Stasis is clear with cost in the knife-sheathing ritual; orientation is immediate, and structure supports thematic buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glass dome and rose farm are essential, constraining and enabling Elara's actions; sensory details like "molten gold and violet" sunset charge the final image with atmospheric resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through Elara's repeated vow; cost is legible in the knife-sheathing and repurposed scrap, driving accumulative pressure toward closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of nurturing over violence is intricately developed through recurring images; subtext in objects like the knife and scrap avoids didacticism, culminating in a resonant, non-literal closure.</comment>
