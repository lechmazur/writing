<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied; her internal conflict between "haunted euphoria" is dramatized, and the final renunciation is earned with visible cost in the chest weight shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost ("weight shifted from lead to light"); accumulative lens holds; orientation is immediate; the locket and ritual constrain tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific; the blooming jetty and ritual tools constrain choice and charge the final image with symbolic persistence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes are internal; escalation through ritual agency; cost legible in the weight shift; one meaningful tightening under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars; subtext in gestures like pressing the locket; ending offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and stable; POV filters perception through Elara's archivist sensibility; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; no loops or scaffolds; figurative language is controlled and purposeful, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Concept is fresh; synthesis of grief ritual with archivist motif feels inevitable; risk in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
