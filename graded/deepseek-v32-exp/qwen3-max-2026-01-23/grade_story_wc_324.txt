<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot with embodied emotion. Her "persistently curious" nature is shown through micro-choices, like lifting the hearing aid, but internal contradiction is minimal, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the mist glowing and whispers rising, cost felt in Elara's dedication. Accumulative lens holds, orientation is early, but cost is more emotional than tangible, slightly limiting impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details ("mist-clad atrium," "marble veined like frozen rivers") create atmosphere. The hearing aid as a tool charges the final image, but the setting itself does not actively constrain choices, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (protecting vulnerable voices) escalate through Elara's agency in tracking and delivering the message. Cost is legible in her focus and Lily's emotional risk, but under the accumulative lens, the tightening is more thematic than causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of incidental heroism emerges organically, but the final paragraph has a slight thematic echo ("heroism was never a grand gesture..."), which edges toward statement over subtext, deducting from resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, perceptual signature clear in Elara's focus on echoes. Rhythm and diction control are strong, but capped due to Q2 not reaching 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with purposeful figurative language. No loops or artifacts obscure closure; information density is high. Capped due to Q2 gate, though line-level craft is exemplary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original concept of a "contact tracer for hearts" is fresh and well-integrated, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in lyrical style pays off, but innovation is slightly tempered by familiar emotional beats.</comment>
