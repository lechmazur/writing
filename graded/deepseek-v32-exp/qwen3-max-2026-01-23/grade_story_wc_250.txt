<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is stated but enacted through specific actions; Elara's emotional change is earned through sensory experience. Contradictory impulses are described rather than fully dramatized in scene, but embodiment is strong. No diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure with emotional cost on-page in Elara's sob and tears; Kael's silence as constraint shapes tactics. Orientation clear early, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details select purposeful; dock, mirror, and shutters function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Atmosphere tightly woven with character perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes in Elara's emotional burden escalate through Kael's light-weaving pattern; cost legible in her release. Under accumulative lens, density increase reweights stake with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of finding light in darkness emerges organically from images and actions; subtext in silence and gesture; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Poetic voice consistent with distinct perceptual signature; POV shifts smoothly between Kael and Elara without head-hopping, maintaining coherence. No dialogue present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High-density prose with varied rhythm; figurative language purposeful and pattern-taught; no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Sentence-level propulsion supports pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silent guardian, dental mirror, and shutter weaving; risk in non-verbal communication pays off with emotional specificity. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
