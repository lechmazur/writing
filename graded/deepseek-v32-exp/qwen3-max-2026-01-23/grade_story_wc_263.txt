<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (freeing creativity from grief) is clear and embodied; internal conflict shown through sensory details and micro-choices (tracing stars); final surrender earned with visible cost in tears and warmth, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds tightly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost on-page in "Rest" and acceptance; orientation clear early; persistent constraint of grief and astrolabe shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (aurora, cold, stone) filtered through Elara's perception; astrolabe as micro-setting constrains choice and charges the final image; archway atmospheric but less active in pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes (freeing creativity) escalate via density of memories under accumulative lens; agency in tracing stars drives deepening; cost legible in emotional release and reconfiguration of grief and joy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of "shadowed rapture" emerges organically from actions and images; subtext in unspoken words and metaphors; ending offers non-literal answer through starlight and acceptance, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature (hears unspoken words); rhythm controls pressure; no head-hopping; elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative but controlled; high information density without loops or scaffold; rhythmic variation supports emotional beats; no figurative muddle in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief and creativity via specific rituals (astrolabe, tracing stars); tropes transformed through grounded details; turns feel inevitable; lyricism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
