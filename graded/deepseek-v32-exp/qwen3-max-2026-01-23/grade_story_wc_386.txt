<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation burns quiet and constant, embodied in micro-choices like weaving truth carefully and deciding to expose the salvaged memory; her final action is earned by prior reverence and the cost is felt in the frozen tear and unburdened spirit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with the snow globe transformed into a vessel of love, cost legible in the rainbow refraction and the realization that true connection requires sharing truth with compassion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glacier shrine and melted snow globe are vivid, selective details that charge the final image; the snow globe’s distorted glass refracting a rainbow directly reconfigured meaning, satisfying the 9+ test by constraining the closure’s emotional weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of salvaging pure love escalates through Elara’s agency—diving into the dream, absorbing its warmth, and choosing to expose the truth—with cost visible in her tear and the careful framing of the revelation as a gift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: the snow globe’s journey from loss to delivered love, without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of borrowed starlight warming generations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature (e.g., “dreams were borrowed starlight”) that controls rhythm under pressure; purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and pattern-taught, e.g., “borrowed starlight” recurs to illuminate truth, and no artifacts obscure clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-whispering via dream analysis and salvaging love from wreckage; specific details like the melted snow globe and glacier shrine transform tropes, and risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
