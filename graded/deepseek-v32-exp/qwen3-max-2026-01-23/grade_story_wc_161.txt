<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to preserve lost songs is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete (e.g., "grief, sharp as the meteorite’s edge") and his final choice to write the truth is earned by the dust-mote trigger, with visible cost in his emotional release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a decisive change from concealment to testimony with felt cost ("breath that felt like his first in twenty years"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds via dust-mote patterns; orientation is clear early, and the meteorite chip constrains tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (attic, skylight, dust motes) is vivid and sensory, filtering through Elias's POV; the meteorite chip and ledger constrain choice and charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving echoes vs. reinvention) escalates when a dust vortex mimics Starlight's ascent, forcing Elias's agency to write; cost is legible in his grief and the act's finality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of trust and memory emerges through particulars (dust, ledger, chip); the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("Trust was not the absence of loss...") without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is selective (dust mapping) and rhythmic control heightens pressure; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language ("Each mote was a tiny historian") is pattern-taught and pays off, clarity intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of pigeon trainer, meteorite chip, and dust mapping feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative, lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure is fully integrated.</comment>
