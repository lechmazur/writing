<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Corbin's motivation is clear and intensifies; his interiority is concrete and reverent, embodied in his perception of bones as libraries and dust as pages. His final choice to become the bridge is an Earned Stasis foreclosing physical movement with a visible cost—nesting the arrowhead, becoming a permanent anchor. The resolution is earned by prior causality (observing the flock's schism) and his foundational hum. A slight deduction as the profound internal change, while resonant, is delivered in a slightly summary final paragraph.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with clear, felt cost: Corbin integrates the Pulse by becoming the canyon's "harmonic anchor," forfeiting his tool and mobility. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building density through sensory patterns (birds, echoes, dust) that culminate in the schism revelation and final merging. Orientation is immediate and vivid; causality is tight within the lyrical pattern. The cost is legible in the final image of the arrowhead being claimed by dust.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting—towers of bone, canyon of echoes—is indispensable, pressuring Corbin's stillness and amplifying the Pulse's resonance. It constrains choice (his brittle body) and decisively charges the closure as he merges with it. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully filtered through his reverent POV. The micro-setting (bone throne, arrowhead) functions as an extension of the character and the conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (integrating the fractured Pulse) escalates through the birds' schism, a pattern break that reveals the bifurcation and deepens Corbin's understanding. His agency—choosing to hum the First Song—drives the resolution under the Accumulative lens. The cost is visible and conceptual: he becomes a permanent, still anchor, a trade-off that forecloses physical navigation. Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully in a single, decisive turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (integration through stillness, reverence for memory) emerges organically from concrete images and actions—bones as libraries, dust as pages, the divided flock. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: navigation is redefined as becoming sanctuary. Subtext is rich in gesture and implication (e.g., the arrowhead warming, dust settling). No moralizing; the final reconfiguration carries conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is a stable, close third-person, fully filtered through Corbin's reverent, ancient consciousness. The voice is distinct and consistent—lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature that notices resonance and memory. Syntax and rhythm modulate effectively with the tension of observation and the release of integration. No head-hopping; all elision (e.g., the Pulse's nature) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly controlled, with excellent rhythmic variation and information density. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though a few phrases approach ornamentation (e.g., "whispers layered through centuries of dust"). No scaffold, loops, or coherence issues. Sentence-level propulsion is strong, accelerating through the schism and resolving into a calm, charged finish. A minor deduction for occasional lushness that slightly risks clarity in mid-beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The core premise—navigating resonance through stillness in a bone canyon—is a fresh, specific synthesis. Tropes of the wise elder and lost magic are transformed through grounded, idiosyncratic details (echo-weaving birds, fused pelvic throne). The emotional arc from seeker to sanctuary feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk-taking in poetic density pays off with coherence and heightened stakes.</comment>
