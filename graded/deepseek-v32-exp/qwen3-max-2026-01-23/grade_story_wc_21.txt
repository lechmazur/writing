<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion under pressure; his archivist mindset drives micro-choices that earn the decisive change, though contradictory impulses in the vision are somewhat subdued.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate; closure lands with on-page cost (agony and absolution) and a decisive change that reshapes historical truth, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and selective; the obsidian lagoon and debris arrangement constrain choice and charge the climax, while the zeppelin library supports theme without merely decorating.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake escalates through Elias's agency in the retrocognitive trap; one meaningful tightening (rearranging debris) forces a trade-off with legible cost, driving the closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of truth and redemption emerges from concrete events; the final image reweights prior material without moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature suited to an archivist; voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffold; figurative language serves atmosphere and clarity even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of historical mystery, retrocognitive fantasy, and zeppelin setting; specific details and emotional truth create a fresh, inevitable-feeling narrative.</comment>
