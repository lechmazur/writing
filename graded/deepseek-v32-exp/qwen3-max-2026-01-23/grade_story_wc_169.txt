<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but she lacks internal contradiction or flaws, rendering her a serene ideal rather than a conflicted human. Her emotional state is uniformly peaceful, with no visible cost or struggle, which limits depth and prevents higher marks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure, and the accumulative/textural lens holds. However, the cost of her dedication is subtle, not sharply felt on the page, which prevents a higher score despite clear causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The grotto is vividly rendered with sensory detail and functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image. It is integral to the ritual and theme, but the high-band gate caps the score due to Q2's rating.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation occurs through Elara's agency, but the pressure is gentle and the cost is implied rather than unmistakable. Under the accumulative lens, a single intensification is present, yet it lacks sharp tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of hope as a pattern emerges organically through images and actions, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer. The story avoids moralizing, but the high-band gate caps the score due to Q2.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature from Elara's POV. Rhythm supports the serene tone without head-hopping, but the high-band gate caps the score due to Q2.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with varied syntax, high information density, and no loops or scaffold that obscure closure. Figurative language is purposeful, but the high-band gate caps the score due to Q2.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The concept of a logical dreamer using a gauge to send hope across timelines is fresh and specific, with synthesis feeling inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical style pays off, but the high-band gate caps the score due to Q2.</comment>
