<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in grief; interiority is embodied (e.g., "quiet, persistent ache"). Her final shift from drifting to moored purpose is earned by the AI revelation, with cost visible in her tears. Contradictory impulses of anchored physicality and mental drift act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing as the AI reveal reweights ecological silence as primary cost. Orientation is clear within 120 words. Closure lands with on-page cost ("Tears streamed... not of despair, but of understanding").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (monitoring station, atlas page) constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered (salt-stiffened suit, turquoise water). The console and torn atlas page are micro-settings that shape tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding why paths disappear) escalates through Elara's tapping agency activating the AI; one meaningful tightening with cost legible in her transformed purpose. Under accumulative lens, pattern break (chime) reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory sustaining ecological paths emerges through particulars (tapping rhythms, coral spawning). Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer: "rhythm was the path." No moralizing; subtext in gestures and imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV stable; voice has distinct perceptual signature (ecological, grief-tinted). Rhythmic prose mirrors tapping patterns; elision (forgotten failsafe) taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("drifting moored") is pattern-taught and coherent. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, supporting momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of climate grief and rhythmic memory; tropes transformed through specific details (biometric key from coral spawning). Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
