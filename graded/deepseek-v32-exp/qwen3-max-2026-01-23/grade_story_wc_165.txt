<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Corbin's analytical nature and quiet rebellion are concretely embodied through precise actions and micro-choices; his motivation compels the central stake and the final validation is earned with visible cost in his warmth and the man's transformed gait. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from calculated setup to payoff; closure is a decisive change (heart lifted, conviction reinforced) with felt cost on-page in the man's tearful smile and Corbin's spread warmth. Orientation anchored immediately; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is essential, not decorative: the tidal arcade's seventh arch constrains placement, and the bishop's crevice charges the final image. Sensory details (damp stone, starlight, rain-scent) are filtered through POV and woven into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (creating serendipitous comfort) escalates through Corbin's agency under the causal lens; cost is legible in the meticulous orchestration and the emotional payoff. The man's arrival and transformation form a meaningful tightening that forecloses solitude.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of orchestrated beauty emerges from particulars without statement; the silent exchange and final image of the bishop journeying offer a resonant, non-literal answer to human connection within routine. No moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt; voice has a distinct perceptual signature (analytical, poetic) that controls rhythm under pressure. No head-hopping; all elision (e.g., calculations) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with high information density and varied sentence rhythm; no paraphrase loops, template cadence, or figurative muddle. Minor overwriting in early description does not obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Concept of orchestrated serendipity is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in lyrical, calculated tone heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity in detail (tidal charts, Vega's light) avoids template plots.</comment>
