<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and embodied, but lacks internal contradiction or conflicting impulses; Elara's steadfast determination reads as one-note, missing the complexity that would elevate the characterization under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the diamond's activation and language reborn; causal lens holds tightly from preparation to execution; cost is legible in the lifted weight of centuries, though relief overshadows sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the finale; the tunnel of echoes and bone towers are woven into action, with sensory detail that propels the translation stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and agency-driven, but escalation lacks a tangible cost or trade-off; the progression from observation to success feels earned yet without tightening pressure that forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of language rebirth emerges organically through texture, sound, and echo; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting silence into living sound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature focused on texture and rhythm; prose control under pressure heightens the accumulative effect without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffold; figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off in closure, maintaining clarity and propulsion throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar tropes (cursed object, last speaker) through specific, irreplaceable details like sky-dancer glyphs and bone towers; the integration feels inevitable and risk-taking in its quiet lyricism.</comment>
