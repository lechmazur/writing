<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion under pressure. The final stance as "gardener of ghosts" is earned by prior causality with visible cost in risk and remembrance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost; accumulative lens holds; orientation is early and clear; persistent constraint of secrecy shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (alcove shelters, cloak muffles) and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through POV; micro-setting functions as tool.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving stories) signaled early; escalation via broadcast fragility and interference; agency in transcription drives deepening; cost legible in fear and ache under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images and actions without moralizing; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer; subtext in lyrics and dust stirring; organic integration with character arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent; rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping; elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful; clarity and propulsion maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh with non-obvious synthesis; specifics (story famine, pirate broadcasts) transform tropes; risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; emotional truth is particular.</comment>
