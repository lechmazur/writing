<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Kael's "serene anger" is embodied and consistent; his final choice not to rebuild the drone is earned by the causal chain of observation and loss, with visible cost. The albino tracker trait is integrated into his perception, though the "consciously wild" label is more tell than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the drone's disappearance via ink patterns leads to Kael's realization about subjective time, with cost felt in his relinquishment. Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate and stable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment is tactile and active—the wind spills the ink, the stone holds the pattern—constraining choice and charging the final image of smoothed sand. Sensory detail is selective and deeply POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding time dilation) escalates through Kael's agency: the spilled ink prompts drone activation, leading to disappearance and revelation. Cost is legible in the drone's loss and his acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (perception, transience, release) emerges organically from concrete images—ink, drone, wind—and culminates in a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The final image reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, tracker-filtered perceptual signature. Prose rhythm and diction are controlled, and purposeful compression (e.g., the eclipse memory) serves closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is dense and rhythmic without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful; sentences advance story and atmosphere with high information density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of temporal distortion, disappearing ink, and a wild tracker feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the premise is transformed through specific detail.</comment>
