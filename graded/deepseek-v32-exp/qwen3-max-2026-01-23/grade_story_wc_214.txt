<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Character's motivation and interiority are concrete, with embodied emotion and a credible earned shift. However, the janitor serves primarily as a vehicle for the theme, lacking contradictory impulses or deep flaws that complicate choices under pressure, limiting the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly; closure is a resonant Conceptual Repricing with clear on-page cost (tear, lighter spirit). The overlooked era and station's dormancy persist as constraints that shape the final image, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting and object (lantern glass) are vividly specific and integral, constraining choice and charging the final image. The station's stillness and the glass's reflection are indispensable to the closure effect, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, the meteor shower provides a decisive intensification that reweights the stake. Protagonist agency (tracing, empathizing) drives escalation, and cost is legible in the tear and shift. However, the internal conflict lacks tangible friction or competing options, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through image and action, but explicit statements like "Vulnerability was not weakness..." risk moralizing in the final paragraphs. The closing image offers a resonant non-literal answer, yet the direct articulation slightly undermines subtextual richness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinctive, with a poetic, reverent perceptual signature. Rhythmic control and diction remain consistent under pressure, and purposeful elision (the overlooked era) is taught and paid off, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught and coherent, even in peak beats. Information density is high, and the closure image is sharp, though a few phrases verge on purple without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic janitor, overlooked era, and vulnerable empathy feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the final reconfiguration is both surprising and earned, marking exceptional originality.</comment>
