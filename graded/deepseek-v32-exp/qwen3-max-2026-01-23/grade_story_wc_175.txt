<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's esoteric realism motivates concrete, detail-oriented actions, and her choice to aid the butterfly is earned with visible cost. However, internal contradiction is minimal, limiting deeper conflict; the emotional embodiment is strong but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with clear cost in the tear and release. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with pattern break from the butterfly's arrival tightening stakes. Orientation is anchored immediately, and causality under the lens is coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The verdant grotto and objects like the moth wing actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective, woven through action, and micro-setting functions as a crucial resource for the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honoring overlooked histories) escalates via the butterfly's interruption, driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in her tear and the impermanent structures, forcing a trade-off that deepens the stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence and compassionate witness emerges organically from particulars like the moth wing and temporary structures. Subtext operates through gesture and image; the final wind-untied tribute offers a resonant, non-literal resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Elara's perceptual signature. POV is stable third-person limited, with rhythmic control that supports pressure without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no artifact loops or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, and closure clarity is untouched by overwriting or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of esoteric realism, ecological elegy, and transient ritual feels inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative, lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors emotional truth.</comment>
