<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her from bewildered curiosity to sacred stewardship. Interiority is concrete and embodied (trembling fingers, frustration tightening shoulders), and her final choice—to receive rather than take—is earned by the causal chain of inquiry, breakthrough, and silent offering. The cost of solemn weight is legible on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly: Elara's actions propel the plot from challenge to clarity. Orientation is immediate (curator, asteroid, orchard). Closure lands with a decisive change—the inheritance complete—and cost is felt in the "solemn weight of stewardship" and the ledger's transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choice: the astral orchard's nonlinear inheritance forces Elara to shift tactics. Sensory details (silver-leaved trees, crunch of regolith) are filtered through her POV, and the pistachio shell cameo charges the final image as it etches sensations into her soul.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forbidden knowledge) escalates through Elara's agency: failed inquiry leads to bathroom breakthrough, then successful receptiveness. Cost is unmistakable in the "brightened disquiet" and weight of stewardship, foreclosing her prior path of extraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mutual exchange and stewardship emerges organically from particulars—the cameo as vessel, the orchard's resonance. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the completed inheritance and ledger image, without moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature reflecting Elara's expertise and wonder. Voice modulates with emotional pressure (e.g., terse frustration before breakthrough), and any elision (e.g., nonlinear inheritance) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("time was not a river but a tapestry") is consistent and clear, and peak beats (e.g., the breakthrough) maintain clarity without artifact or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of astral orchard, nonlinear inheritance, and pistachio shell cameo feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in concept and setting heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the transformation through character-specific detail avoids template plots.</comment>
