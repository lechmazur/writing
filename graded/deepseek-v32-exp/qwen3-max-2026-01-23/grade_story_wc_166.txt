<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but internal conflict is absent; her steady resolve simplifies emotional complexity. However, her actions align with motives, and the closure choice is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant cost (Elara's release, Kael's transformation) under an accumulative/textural lens; the nostalgia ban persists as constraint, and orientation is immediate without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is lush and functional, with the garden's anchor and release directly tied to Elara's purpose; sensory details are selective and charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's ritualistic inscription, driven by her agency; cost is legible in the anchor's dissolution and Kael's resolve, though external conflict is minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of defiant artistry emerges organically from particulars like the moonstone dust and gaps; the final image reweights the ban's powerlessness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is consistently poetic and filtered through Elara's tide-dancer perception; POV is stable, with rhythmic control supporting the accumulative build.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense but precise, with figurative language enhancing clarity; no loops or scaffolding, and high information density propels the scene to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of exile, cosmic mapping, and artistic resistance feels fresh and inevitable; lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
