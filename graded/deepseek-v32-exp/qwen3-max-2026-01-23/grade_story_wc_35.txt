<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear and rooted in his unique gift; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion under pressure. The final choice to subsume remorse is earned by prior causality with visible cost in his exhaustion and the weight in his bones.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the pavilion shifts from cold blue to amber, with cost legible in "Weight settled deep in his bones." Inferred accumulative/textural lens holds; orientation is anchored early without penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the tidal pool and coral pavilion constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Aris's chef perspective, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—subsuming remorse—escalates through Aris's agency under the accumulative lens; cost is unmistakable in his trembling exhaustion and the pavilion's transformation. Pressure tightens meaningfully without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of healing through transformation emerges organically from images like sandpapering memories and polishing shards. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, rooted in concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—culinary and sensory metaphors filter perception. Voice is lyrical yet controlled, and rhythmic modulation supports pressure without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative but purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "liquid sky") slightly dampens propulsion without obscuring closure; no loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of memory-tasting chef and stored remorse feels inevitable; tropes are transformed through specific details like tidal pool analysis. Risk-taking in accumulative, lyrical design heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
