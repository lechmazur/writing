<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and embodied in deliberate actions, but lacks internal contradiction or flaw demonstration; final choice is earned through ritual causality with subtle cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an accumulative/textural lens; orientation is immediate, cost is legible in the blood-drop and effort, though light.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral to the ritual, constraining choice (crater geometry pools starlight) and charging the final image with the bud's emergence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency in the accumulative build of the ritual; cost is legible in the blood sacrifice and patient labor, tightening stakes toward renewal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hope through translation of memory into light emerges organically from concrete images; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and filtered through Elara's lyrical perception; voice is distinct and rhythmic, with purposeful compression that supports the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative but controlled, with high information density and no artifacts; rhythm and clarity are maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of alchemy, starlight, and cartography feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical, quiet closure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
