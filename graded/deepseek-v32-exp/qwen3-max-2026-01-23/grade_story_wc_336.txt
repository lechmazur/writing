<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation and interiority are clear and embodied, but the character lacks contradictory impulses or genuine struggle, which limits the highest band. Her competence and emotional consistency are well portrayed, and the final act is earned by prior causality, though the cost is subtle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; orientation is early and clear. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with felt cost in her tear and connection. The persistent constraint of the creeping gray shapes her urgency, but the threat remains abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail filtered through Elara's perception. The parapet and seed function as micro-settings that charge the final image (bud unfurling). However, the environment does not strongly constrain choice, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving wonder) is clear and escalates through her agency under the accumulative lens. Cost is felt but not unmistakable; the abstract conflict with gray indifference lacks concrete pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete images and actions. The final bud unfurling offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. Some explicit statement ("preserve the color of wonder") is integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct lyrical perceptual signature. Rhythmic control supports pressure; no head-hopping. The voice is consistent and purposeful, though slightly ornate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative but controlled, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops or scaffold; figurative language remains clear even in peak beats. Minor overwriting does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical realism and horticultural wisdom feels inevitable. The specific, grounded perspective and emotional specificity avoid generic templates. Risk-taking in lyrical abstraction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
