<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and her motivation—to understand collective grief—drives the narrative. Her "fiercely meditative" trait is shown through action, and her final design choice emerges credibly from reflection and spectral guidance. However, the portrayal lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene, leaning toward focused resolution rather than internal conflict under pressure. The emotional progression is realistic and the cost is felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; imagery and memory build to a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands on-page with clear cost: Elara's tears of revelation and the weight of her commission. Orientation is immediate; the single scene with a memory shard is seamless. The butterfly migration metaphor transforms the stake, and the final image reconfigures meaning without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through Elara's professional and personal lens. The ancient greenhouse and butterfly migration are not just backdrop—they pressure her insight and charge the final image. The ribbon roll as a micro-setting object recurs and decisively shapes the memorial design. Economy and purpose are exemplary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing collective grief) is signaled early and tightens through Elara's reflective agency under the accumulative lens. The parallel with butterfly migration acts as a pattern break that reweights the stake, leading to her design epiphany. Cost is legible in her tears and the solemn responsibility she accepts. No coincidental resolution; escalation is driven by character.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: the ribbon ritual, butterfly migration, and memorial design coalesce into a resonant exploration of grief as connective migration. Subtext operates through image and implication; the ending offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from specific experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, meditative voice that matches Elara's profession and temperament. Diction and syntax are controlled, rhythmic, and heighten pressure without obscuring clarity. Lyra's dialogue is sparse but serves thematic reinforcement. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and vivid.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical but purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. No scaffold, loops, or figurative muddle that obscure causality. Slight risk of overwriting ("dusk bled indigo") but remains voice-motivated and legible. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with emotional beats; closure image is crisp and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of gravestone carver, spectral mentor, butterfly migration, and ribbon ritual feels fresh and inevitable. The concept of collective grief as a migratory pattern is a non-obvious angle executed with specificity. Risk-taking in lyricism pays off in thematic coherence. The combination is organic, not checklist-driven.</comment>
