<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and interiority concrete, but the character lacks internal contradiction or on-page change, limiting depth. Her competence and static empathy suit the lyrical mode but reduce struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where silence is deepened with cost. Orientation is early and clear, structure a single coherent scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice—the sculpture and insulator are tactile resources. The grove charges the final image, but a cap applies due to Q2 score below 8.8.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, stakes reweight via density of notes and transformed silence. Protagonist's strumming drives escalation, but lacks a traditional reversal or tightening of options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of empathy and silence emerges organically from imagery; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Cap applied due to Q2 score below 8.8.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (symphonically minded). POV is stable and apt for the quiet, accumulative mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is poetic and dense with controlled rhythm; no loops or artifacts. Minor risk of overwriting is purposeful. Cap applied due to Q2 score below 8.8.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept is fresh—tree-song sculptor using an insulator to strum a sculpture—and synthesis feels organic. The quiet, lyrical approach is a risk that coheres.</comment>
