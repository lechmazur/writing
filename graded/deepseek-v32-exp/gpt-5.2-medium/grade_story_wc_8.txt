<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her profession and personal history; her "emotionally rational" trait is embodied in her measured confrontation and final bargain. The final choice—offering a curated exhibit—is earned by prior causality and her father's story, with visible cost in the bare rosebush and cold wind. Hadrin's admission adds depth, avoiding a one-note antagonist.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: each beat follows from Mara's goal to recapture the letter. Closure is a decisive change—she retrieves the document and secures a path to truth—with cost legible in the "bare" rosebush and "cold wind." Orientation is immediate; the rosebush signal and station setting anchor who, where, and why within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and charged: the ivy-hidden station isolates the meeting, and the rosebush's final petal acts as a temporal and symbolic signal. The environment constrains choice (secrecy) and charges the final image with the "bare" rosebush and "cold wind," reweighting the stakes without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. noble lies) escalates through Mara's agency: she confronts, draws parallels, and offers a bargain that forces Hadrin's admission. The tightening is causal and legible, with cost shown in her father's compliance and the rosebush's barren state. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the letter, the rosebush, and Mara's bargain; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the annotated publication and curated exhibit. Subtext operates in the ivy "graves" and the rosebush's signal, avoiding moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, filtered through Mara's historian perception ("graves with green hair"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in Hadrin's practiced sigh and Mara's measured questioning. Voice remains consistent under pressure, with purposeful rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with vivid figurative language ("weeds rose through the tiles like slow smoke") that never muddles clarity. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and there are no loops, scaffolds, or register drifts. Information density is high, with each line advancing character or atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a historian confronting "noble lies" feels fresh and inevitable; specific details like the illuminated letter and rosebush signal transform familiar tropes through grounded character choices. Risk-taking in the quiet, negotiated resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
