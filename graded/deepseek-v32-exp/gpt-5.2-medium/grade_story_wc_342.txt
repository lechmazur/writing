<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Liora's face blindness is a concrete, character-specific limit that shapes her perception and choices; her micro-choices (decoding the coin, painting under time pressure) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final acceptance of time's limit is earned, though internal contradiction could be more dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure lands with legible cost (the tree's demolition and the painted sky left behind). Orientation is immediate, structure is a single continuous scene, and the coin/book mechanism integrates without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The tree‑trunk library is vivid, sensory, and actively constrains choice (time pressure, safe mechanism). It charges the final image of the painted constellations and is indispensable to the story’s logic and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (paint the sky/retrieve the book before demolition) is clear and tightens via the foreman’s approach. Agency drives escalation, and the cost of leaving the art to destruction is felt, though the external pressure remains somewhat quiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of discovering limits emerges organically from face blindness, recursive patterns, and the book’s lesson; the ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing. Subtext is woven through image and action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature (artist’s pattern‑oriented observation). Lyrical voice remains consistent under pressure, and minimal dialogue serves goal‑pursuit without head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense, polished, and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and coherent. No scaffold loops or register drift; sentence‑level rhythm supports the accumulative build and closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of face‑blind artist, tree library, fractal art, and coin‑locked safe feels inevitable. Risk‑taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the premise is transformed through specific, grounded detail.</comment>
