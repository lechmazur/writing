<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and contradictory (love vs. refusal); her final choice to persuade Iven is earned by prior causality and the cicada's foresight, with visible cost in the foreseen losses. Iven's softening via memory and fear adds depth. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied (thumb worrying seam, cold charm).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (agreement to try) with resonant reconfiguration (wave image). Hybrid lens (causal/textural) holds; cost is legible in "rougher than expected" texture and lost living subjects. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Grotto and cicada function as micro-settings that constrain choice (tide limits time, cicada enables foresight) and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered (starlight line, dripstone). Lacks one hairline specificity to reach higher band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving chronicling vs. change) escalates via Mara's agency—using cicada to foresee, then persuading Iven. Cost is legible in foreseen outcomes and Iven's fear. One meaningful tightening under hybrid lens; no coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of time and transition emerges from concrete images (cicada, waves erasing footprints). Final paradox ("leaving and staying") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in dialogue and gesture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct perceptual signature (Mara's observational, lyrical voice). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven; psychic distance is stable. No head-hopping; elision (foresight mechanics) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density. Figurative language ("thicken like syrup") is purposeful and clear. No scaffold loops or artifacts; sentence-level propulsion matches scene pressure. Minor restraint in peak beats keeps it from 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical realism (jade cicada, texture of time) with environmental stakes. Transformation of tropes through specific lived detail (tidal-pool chronicler). Risk-taking coheres and heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
