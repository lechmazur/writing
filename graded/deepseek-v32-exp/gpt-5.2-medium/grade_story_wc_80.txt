<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and deeply personal, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. However, internal contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced, limiting the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration: Lira accepts she cannot recover her mother but can chart the spaces, with cost legible in wet sleeves and warm inkwell. Causal lens holds tightly from motive to action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion constrains choices and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and filtered through Lira's POV, creating a hushed, watery atmosphere integral to the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal quest to physical confrontation with Beran, driven by Lira's agency; cost is visible in the struggle and escape, tightening under causal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of interlaced absence emerges through concrete particulars—inkwell, pavilion, notes—without statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice; minimal dialogue is natural, and perceptual signature remains consistent under pressure, though dialogue is sparse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with no loops or artifacts; figurative language is controlled and serves momentum, achieving high information density without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Story synthesizes surveyor precision, personal loss, and submerged memory into a fresh, specific whole that feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical prose heightening stakes.</comment>
