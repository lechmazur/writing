<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lio's contradictory trust and distrust of perfection are embodied in micro-choices; his final rupture is motivated by the frost pattern and Mara's whisper, with the cost of library reordering felt. Minor deduction for a told beat ("he knew why she had left") but the closure choice is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal-hybrid lens holds; orientation is immediate; closure is a decisive change with conceptual repricing (eternity compressed, Mara returns) and cost legible in the library's shuddering agreements and transformed sky.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The glass orchard library is indispensable, constraining choice (frost patterns on glass bark direct action) and charging the final image (the tree's inner surface prints the moment). Sensory detail is selective and woven through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (compress eternity to hold Mara) escalates through Lio's agency: the spiral frost triggers his decision to rupture, which visibly costs the library's order. The tightening forecloses the old system of agreements.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of negotiating reality emerges through particulars (frost, press, whisper); the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the mirrored sky and frozen instant, reweighting perfection and stasis without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature; diction and syntax reflect Lio's professional precision and emotional weight; the bottled whisper's dialogue is economical and charged.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and artifact-free; figurative language is consistent and purposeful; sentences accelerate with the press's action; closure image is clear and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of negotiable reality, glass orchard library, and letterpress mechanics; specific, irreplaceable details; risk-taking in poetic density pays off with a transformative closure.</comment>
