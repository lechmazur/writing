<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is clear and rooted in her identity as a musician inspired by silence; her micro-choices under pressure (taps, breath, movement) reveal a hierarchy of values. However, internal contradiction is minimal, and the final choice, while earned, lacks a sharply felt personal cost beyond the conceptual shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: each clue leads Lena forward via water damage and response. Closure is a decisive change—finding the ledger and arranging musicians—with cost legible in the transformation of performance. Orientation is immediate; the ghost's code provides a persistent constraint that shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The flooded opera house is not just atmosphere but a constraint that enables the plot (water damage reveals clues) and charges the final image of music in ruin. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Lena's professional perception, with spatial choreography clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unraveling the code to disrupt performance) escalates through Lena's agency as she follows maps and replies with taps. One meaningful tightening occurs when the swollen door creaks open after her fermata, foreclosing isolation and enabling the ledger's discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of music in silence and in-between spaces emerges through concrete events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via musicians playing in gaps, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature; prose rhythm modulates with pressure (e.g., "flame fluttered like a nervous bow stroke"). Purposeful elision (wordless conversation) is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with figurative language consistently serving atmosphere and causality. No loops or scaffolds; sentences vary naturally (e.g., the opening "taken the river into its ribs"). Information density high, advancing story and character simultaneously.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of haunted theatre, water-damage code, and in-between spaces feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in wordless communication and lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, resulting in a singular artistic stance.</comment>
