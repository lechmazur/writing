<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in adaptive traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, and the final choice to create a testament is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages; orientation is immediate; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in the final image of making "every surviving breath a clear testament."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image: the canyon's frost patterns guide detection, and the furnace built from stones alters tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the artist's perception of light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: retracing the ledger's route leads to clues and the decisive act of creating the glass pane. Cost is legible in the risk and emotional sting of copied work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images—purpose in pauses, endurance—with subtext in the "scorched testament" and frost patterns. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature ("read light"); voice is lyrical and consistent, modulating under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present, advancing plot without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid imagery; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and information density is high, especially in peaks like the frost-reading sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of glass artistry, detective work, and thematic resonance feels inevitable; specific details (frost patterns, ledger strip) transform familiar tropes through grounded choices that heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
