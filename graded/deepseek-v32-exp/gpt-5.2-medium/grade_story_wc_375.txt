<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interior contradiction (duty vs. calling) is dramatized through concrete micro-choices; her final decision to paint the mural is earned by prior causality, with the cost of suppressed creativity and maternal sacrifice felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight and closure lands as a decisive change with felt cost; orientation is immediate; the inferred causal lens holds without contradiction, and the broken lock persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Subterranean crystal cave is vividly rendered and constrains choice (crystals as canvas, lock as obstacle); sensory detail is selective and purposeful, charging the final image of the mural and hidden stage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncorking creativity) escalates through protagonist agency under the causal lens; the broken lock forces a meaningful tightening, and the cost is legible in the mother’s notebook and Mara’s final laugh.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of creativity, inheritance, and vocation emerges through image and action, not statement; the final mural offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; poetic voice remains controlled under pressure, and elision (e.g., memory flashes) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, propelling the story to a resonant final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of art, memory, and magic realism feels inevitable; the painting-as-key and crystal cave are specific, non-obvious choices that heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
