<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ilya’s motivation and concrete actions are clear and consistent, earning her final poised stance. The "awkwardly confident" trait is more told than shown, and interior contradictions are not deeply explored, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly; orientation is immediate; closure lands as a charged poise with legible cost (the shadow, the end of the lull). The stone circle’s constraint shapes the entire climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choice: the repair bay supplies the circle and console; the stone circle constrains action and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reigniting rebellion/finding meaning) escalates through Ilya’s agency; cost is visible in the risk of transmission and the unknown shadow. One meaningful tightening drives to the charged poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of meaning and connection emerges through concrete particulars (circle, hum, glasses) without moralizing. The final image—stepping onto the stones—reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and voice is distinct: lyrical, star‑gazer‑filtered perception with rhythmic control. No head‑hopping; purposeful elision (the hum’s mechanics) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, dense, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and clear; sentence rhythm varies naturally, supporting atmosphere and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ancient mysticism and sci‑fi rebellion feels organic and inevitable. The stone‑circle communication method is specific and irreplaceable; risk‑taking in quiet, charged closure heightens stakes.</comment>
