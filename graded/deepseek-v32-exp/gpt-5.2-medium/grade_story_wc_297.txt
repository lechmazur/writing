<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysa's "purposefully curious" trait is embodied in her anxious elation and decisive actions; her final choice to trace her scar is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, though depth is slightly limited by the story's brevity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a decisive change (mending the covenant, finding her mother) with cost legible on the page ("pain flashed like a small private eclipse"). The visionary's instruction and the clipping/scar setup pay off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobalt glade and the maze topiary clipping function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details ("blue metallic sheen," "air tasted of rain") are selective and purposeful, fully integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding her mother) escalates through Lysa's agency; the cost of offering her wound is unmistakable and tightens options. Pressure coheres under the causal lens, though the conflict is straightforward.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images (scars, eclipse, covenant) without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—mending through shared pain returns a present that "could wait for its future."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, rhythmic voice that reflects Lysa's perception. Dialogue is sparse but character-specific (visionary's "voice dry as bark"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet precise, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops or scaffold; figurative language ("pain flashed like a small private eclipse") heightens peak beats without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of time, dreams, and scars feels inevitable; the premise is fully committed and transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in poetic density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
