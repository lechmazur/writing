<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Erem’s motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; his internal conflict is embodied in micro-choices (trembling papers, steadying hands). The final act—speaking the warning—arises from his professional obsession and emotional archive goal, earning the closure with visible cost (“soft unease”). Slight direct telling of motivation holds back a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: discovery of wax cylinder leads to prophecy interpretation and decisive action. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the final image of stored wax and unease. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting (orchard garden atop skyscraper) is vividly specific, constrains choice (isolation from clerks), and charges the final image (cedar box storage). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven through action and perception, mirroring internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (city’s fate) escalates via Erem’s agency: playing the cylinder, interpreting the prophecy, finding the loophole, and broadcasting the warning. Cost is legible in the “soft unease of saved lives” and the limitation of what he can offer.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (emotional archives as truest contract) emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: “the truest contract is what we refuse to let happen.” No moralizing; ambiguity lingers with unease.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV (Erem) is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, profession-inflected voice (“velvet disquiet,” dead-language cadence). No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent under pressure, and elision (the prophecy’s content) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (“like sap through bark”). Sentence rhythm varies naturally, accelerating and breathing with scene needs; closure beat is clear and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of oath scribe, wax-cylinder prophecy, and skyscraper orchard feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept (accidental prophecy) is transformed through specific character and setting; risk-taking with quiet, lyrical climax heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
