<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Riven Hale's dry-witted interiority and micro-choices under pressure are concrete and consistent; his motivation to correct the map intensifies credibly, and the final decision to deliver the lines carries visible cost against Ministry threat. Lysa provides calm secondary pressure. Slight deduction for minimal internal contradiction in peak beats, but closure choice is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from falcon's return to discovery; orientation is immediate, closure is a Charged Poise with felt cost in "people who think maps are weapons." The condensation tracing and spring finding form a decisive change reconfigured by the final listening moment, cost legible in the tranquil worry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through POV, with the rusted outpost and frozen lake pressuring choices (dead radio, window as tool). The condensation on glass constrains the key mapping beat and charges the final image of the spring, making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding the rivers' source) escalates through protagonist agency: sending Slate, interpreting "Converge," tracing condensation, journeying to the spring. Cost is unmistakable in the Ministry threat and the personal realization; one meaningful tightening forecloses the blank-space option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from convergence, maps as weapons, and language as shelter; subtext in phrasebook and condensation. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the spring "beginning again and again," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct dry-witted, editorial voice; perceptual signature shapes noticing (e.g., coastlines in condensation). Compression is purposeful, dialogue minimal but natural, and elision (dead radio) taught and paid off in isolation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without overwriting; sentences advance story with rhythmic control ("the lake ice sighed"). No paraphrase loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is consistent and clarity is maintained even in peak beats like the condensation tracing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of atlas editing, hydrological convergence, and political secrecy feels inevitable; specific details (phrasebook dog-ear, window condensation) transform familiar tropes. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure recharges all elements.</comment>
