<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lina's motivation is clear and intensifies from curiosity to hunger; interiority is concrete and embodied, as seen when "the question turned from curiosity to hunger." Her final reckoning and mural are earned by persistent investigation, with visible cost in her forehead against the cold frame.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens held throughout; closure is a conceptual repricing with cost legible in Lina's reckoning. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the mosaic shards (pavilion, cathedral, window) cohere with taught transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective (e.g., "soot-dark cathedral," "cloister garden"), filtered through Lina's POV. The cathedral window constrains choice and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding night blooms) escalates through Lina's agency; cost is felt in her emotional reckoning. One meaningful tightening occurs at the window discovery, reweighting options under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of engineered gentleness emerges through particulars like the window layers and mother's confession; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, as in "gentleness could be engineered."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice (e.g., "umbral tenderness"); perceptual signature is character-specific. No dialogue, but prose rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied syntax and no artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful (e.g., "stone itself were exhaling perfume"), and information density supports momentum without loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of art, botany, and personal legacy feels inevitable; specific details like etched glass layers and postcards transform the quest. Risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
