<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to safeguard innovation is clear and consistent, compelling her to transform the threat into a lesson. Interiority is concrete and character-particular (e.g., "my hands hovered over it as if the seed could hear"). The final choice to build a living puzzle is earned by her established traits and methods, with a visible cost in the woman's "wet eyes" and the reset silence. Minor deduction for a slightly over-tidy decision path; her receptiveness and protectiveness don't generate contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mara's refusal to commercialize, resetting locks with a new rule, forecloses the corporate path with felt cost ("wet eyes," "storm-born silence settle again, this time like a vow"). Orientation is immediate. The orthogonal investigation tightens options logically. Cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is integral and constrains choice: the brookside haven provides the venting mechanism; the shed becomes the living puzzle. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (odor of cloves and rot, fresh mud prints). The storm-born silence opens and closes the story, charging the final vow. Environmental details mirror internal stakes and shape tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safeguarding innovative space) is signaled early and escalates through Mara's agency: she investigates, builds the puzzle room, and turns the test back on the sender. The confrontation forces a trade-off—vent the room, proving "no one owns life"—with a visible cost in the visitor's reaction. One meaningful tightening is sufficient and well-executed under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (innovation vs. control, stewardship vs. ownership) emerges organically from the seed, the escape room, and the final mechanism. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the rule "puzzles should open minds, not markets." Subtext operates in gesture and image (the vented seedling, the torn courier paper). Avoids moralizing; the final repricing is earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara's professional bias filters details (locks, mechanisms, clues). Voice is textured and consistent ("storm-born silence," "orthogonal approaches"). Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven and carries subtext in the confrontation. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and varied sentence structure. No loops or scaffolding artifacts. Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated ("wrapped in storm-born silence," "across the hush of a possibility just born"). Minor deduction for a slight register elevation in "notably receptive" that briefly distances, but clarity and momentum remain strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of escape-room design, botany, and corporate intrigue feels organic and inevitable. The corpse flower seed is a fresh, non-obvious symbol. Risk-taking in structure (orthogonal approaches) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The final image recharges prior material with specificity and cost.</comment>
