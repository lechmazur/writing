<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("watchful" vs. "quietly explosive") is concrete and embodied, driving micro-choices (trembling over the map). The final renunciation of control for a new practice is earned by the sun-trail quest, with cost felt in the vow's wording. Minor deduction for a slight diagnostic label ("I realized...") at peak closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds tightly; closure is a resonant Conceptual Repricing ("a practice, not a plot") with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is immediate and functional. The sun-trail pattern is taught early and pays off decisively, reweighting all prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Environment (floating tea house, sun trails) and objects (morpho wing, dye jar) decisively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("shawl of mist," "dye so blue it seemed to drink the air"), fully filtered through the dye master's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (to learn why stories magnetize) is signaled early and escalates meaningfully via the sun-trail discoveries. Each dot deepens knowledge and narrows options, driven by protagonist agency. Cost is legible in the final vow's trade-off ("so that the stories... will be safe").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from action and image, resisting statement. The final answer—that stories stick to those who illuminate ignored paths—is a resonant, non-literal repricing of the opening question. The morpho wing and "iridescent caution" shift from personal mystery to ethical practice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("noticed every stain and every lie") controls the voice. POV is stable and deep, with syntax and rhythm modulating perfectly under pressure ("My new heart hammered against my ribs..."). Any elision (Sairi's past) is paid off in the closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid with strong rhythmic control. A minor template-cadence run ("I followed the sun trail dot by dot... each dot answered...") in a middle beat prevents a higher score. Otherwise, zero loops or figurative muddle; closure image is crystal clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A specific, non-obvious synthesis of heart transplant, dye mastery, and magical cartography. The core concept ("iridescent caution") transforms familiar tropes through grounded, character-driven choices. The ending feels inevitable, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
