<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and her motivation clear; the final choice to cultivate contentment is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Some internal conflict is summarized rather than fully dramatized, but micro-choices under pressure reveal a consistent hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tight causal structure with on-page closure: Mara's discovery in the grotto leads to a decisive change (offering the hairpin, planting the fig) with felt cost. The Causal lens holds throughout, and orientation is anchored early. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposefully integrated; the grotto and pool constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's POV, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Causal lens, from questioning to grotto exploration to realization. Cost is legible in the emptiness-as-furrow concept and her decision to work with her brother, tightening stakes meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions (pool showing seasons, hairpin offering); the ending provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the contentment question without moralizing. Subtext operates through implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with a distinct lyrical perceptual signature; voice modulates with emotional intensity and maintains rhythmic control. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Flawless line-level craft: high information density, varied syntax, and purposeful figurative language without loops or artifacts. Prose propels momentum and clarity, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (sky vineyard, umbral grotto, cycle of rebirth) feels inevitable and fresh; risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
