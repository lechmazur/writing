<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal plot with tight linkage; closure lands with emotional cost as dread drains, and the reversible exile concept is integrated without breaking causality. Orientation is clear early, lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details and the weather station setting pressure choices; the copper nail as a micro-setting object constrains action and charges the final image. Specificity is purposeful and integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mara's agency; decoding and confrontation force a trade-off with cost legible in the spongey dread. Dominant stake tightens under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory and exile emerges from particulars; the realization about bravery and belief is slightly explicit but earned by the narrative. Minor thematic echo in final paragraph reduces score.</comment>
