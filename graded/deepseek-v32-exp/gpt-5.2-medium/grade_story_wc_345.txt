<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Collective "we" POV provides clear group motivation and unity, but limits individual interiority and contradiction; micro-choices (following chalk, ringing bell) reveal trust; final decision to adopt Serren's mission is earned, with cost in separation and responsibility passed on.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly; orientation established early; closure is a Decisive Change (relay well opens, path revealed) with Resonant Reconfiguration (family as practice); cost legible in Serren's fading and the promise to continue; persistent constraint of needing many hands drives tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral—floating arches, bell, chalk—constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory detail selective and purposeful; but capped because Q2 < 9.0, though environment actively shapes closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survival/respite) escalates through collective effort and revelation of Serren's sacrifice; agency in trusting chalk messages and rebuilding relay; cost visible in labor and emotional weight of leaving; one meaningful tightening under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of family as practice emerges organically from events and images; final line ("family was a practice, not a bloodline") is slightly explicit but earned by prior action; subtext in chalk, bell, and shared labor reweights the ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person plural POV is stable and distinct, with a reflective, collective voice; no dialogue; perceptual signature consistent; rhythmic control supports pressure; elision (ghost's past) taught and paid off in log revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and propulsive; high information density without loops or scaffolding; figurative language ("brambled hope") enhances atmosphere; minor cap due to Q2 < 9.0, but clarity and momentum remain strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sci-fi and ghost story feels inevitable; collective POV and chalk-message mechanic are fresh and risk-taking; specifics (orchard world, floating arches) avoid template; closure integrates concept with character-driven choice.</comment>
