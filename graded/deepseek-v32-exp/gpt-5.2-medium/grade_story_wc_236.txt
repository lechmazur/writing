<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Iris's contradiction—loss of smell sharpening visual perception—drives embodied micro-choices; her final realization is earned by prior causality with visible cost in "the old trembling calm." No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains concrete under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: because Iris reads the screw's tarnish, she humanizes the delivery, leading to a Conceptual Repricing at closure. Orientation is immediate; cost legible in her understanding that she "could still unveil ordinary miracles."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The water clock and birthing clamp screw constrain choice and charge the final image; fog and shop details are filtered through Iris's perceptual bias, weaving setting into action. Sensory selection is purposeful, avoiding ornamental breadth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Iris's need to find meaning) escalates via her agency: from reading the note to intervening at the birthing house. Cost is unmistakable in Aster's loosened shoulders and the father's shift, tightening under causal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from Iris's skill of reading between lines; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through gesture and silence, as in the father staring "through his lashes."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited to Iris, with a distinct perceptual signature ("through occluded views"). Voice modulates with emotional pressure but remains consistent; dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("like it had been held near a candle while a person cried") is controlled and serves clarity; no register drift in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of aromatherapist losing smell, water clock repair, and midwife crisis feels inevitable; specific details transform tropes through character-driven choices. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
