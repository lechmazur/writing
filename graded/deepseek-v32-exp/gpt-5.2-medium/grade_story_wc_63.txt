<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's guilt and ethical diligence are embodied in concrete actions and micro-choices; her final acceptance of incremental absolution is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the painful easing of her ribs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the cost is legible on-page in the widow's nod and Mara's eased pain; orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The obsidian ridge and pendulum bob are micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens, from investigation to recalibration; cost is unmistakable in the physical and emotional price she pays at the ridge and with the widow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of incremental absolution emerges through particulars like the pendulum swing and lead weight, offering a non-literal answer at closure without moralizing; subtext operates in image and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; lyrical voice modulates with pressure, and any elision (e.g., Torren's backstory) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the pause in the pendulum's swing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mechanical penance and environmental dependence feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical technicality heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming the clock-winder trope.</comment>
