<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara’s obliging practicality and Sen’s theoretical drive are distinct and motivate key turns. Mara’s interiority is concrete (“stomach tighten”), and her final stance—toolbox over theory—is earned by prior causality. The relationship shifts credibly, though Mara’s internal contradiction is subtle rather than stark.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from inciting lever-pull to repair and reset. Orientation is immediate and clear. Closure is a decisive change with conceptual cost (time resumes forward “while keeping its sideways secrets”), and the nexus as persistent constraint shapes every tactical choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (“frost filmed the observation dome”) and constrains choice throughout: the nexus, gliders, and roof magnetic lines pressure Mara’s actions. The final image of “icy warmth” is charged by earlier sensory details, making environment indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (station integrity) escalates via Mara’s agency: she pulls the lever, sees the future rotor break, and chooses repair. Cost is legible in the vision’s stomach-tightening risk and the final reconfigured understanding between practicality and theory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of time as a toolbox emerges through action and image, culminating in Mara’s spoken realization—a slight explicitness that remains earned. The ending reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity, though the thematic statement is a hairline literal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and voice is consistently poetic yet precise (“a lung holding its breath”). Mara’s perceptual signature filters all details; dialogue is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or register drift, even under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without purple excess. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Information density is high (“maps of field lines drawn through holographic principles”), and closure image is clear and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sideways time, xenobiology, and mechanic’s practicality feels fresh and inevitable. The concept is fully committed, with specific details (magnetic nexus, glider-beasts) transforming potential tropes. Risk-taking in poetic language heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
