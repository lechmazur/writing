<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Nabu-iddin's frugality and empirical irony are consistently embodied, driving choices from accepting the tile to sacrificing his stylus. Interior contradiction between verification and faith is shown in scene, not summarized. Final renunciation of certainty is earned with visible cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal linkage tightens from tile discovery to covenant sealing with no gaps. Orientation is immediate and clear. Closure is a decisive change: breaking the stylus offers empirical certainty to the unknown, with cost legible in the snapped instrument and new constellations on his palms.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting of reimagined Babylonian palace is filtered through POV, with selective sensory detail that constrains action. The tile and stylus function as micro-settings that charge the final image. "Circuit traces" metaphor integrates ancient and modern without breaking tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—certainty versus encrypted devotion—escalates under causal lens through protagonist agency: studying tile, waiting for Mars, uncloaking mask. Final choice to break stylus is a tightening that forecloses empirical certainty with unmistakable cost on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of measurable irony versus faith emerges through concrete particulars: magic square sums, schematic representations, broken stylus. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via new constellations on palms, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with perceptual signature shaped by astronomer's precision and irony. Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, matching character's mindset. No head-hopping; dialogue is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density, advancing story and character in every sentence. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. Sentences vary in length and structure, supporting momentum. Minor complexity in metaphorical language is purposeful and consistent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ancient astronomy, magic squares, and covenant with the unknown feels inevitable. Trope of hidden knowledge is transformed through specific character and setting. Risk-taking in lyrical prose and conceptual depth heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
