<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through concrete, character-particular observations. However, internal conflict and contradictory impulses under pressure are underdeveloped; the final choice is earned but lacks visible emotional cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strong with clear because/therefore linkages. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the final image—Mira accepts her father's absence and continues his work. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is indispensable, constraining choice (the seven-minute corridor) and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and fully integrated with POV, creating a vivid, lived-in environment that guides action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens, from decoding the logbook to crossing the corridor. The dominant stake (understanding thresholds/finding her father) tightens meaningfully, with cost felt in her renunciation of immediate reunion and commitment to building her own maze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of "necessary distances" emerges organically from concrete events and images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer at closure. Subtext operates through gesture and implication (the doorframe, the brass plate) without moralizing, and the final image reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt, with a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature ("featherly determined," "fractured hush"). Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and purposeful compression (e.g., the logbook code) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and clear, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is voice-motivated and consistent. Minor abstraction in phrases like "hush fracture" is intentional and does not obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of drifting terraces, maze architecture, and the conceptual core of "necessary distances" feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in poetic language and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the story commits fully to its premise with authentic vision.</comment>
