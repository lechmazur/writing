<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's interiority is concrete and embodied; micro-choices under pressure (tearing ledger page for bear) reveal values; final realization earned by prior causality with visible cost; contradictory impulses act in scene without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchored early; accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with felt cost on-page ("bear the longing honestly"); persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory detail vivid and purposeful (petrichor, wet lichen); environment constrains choice (quartz vein prompts key realization); setting filters through POV and charges final image; spatial choreography clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (making peace with abandoned dream) signaled early; escalation under accumulative lens via density increase (bear encounter, vibration); agency drives insight; cost legible in acceptance of longing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars without moralizing; subtext in gestures (tearing page, bearing fear); ending offers resonant non-literal answer (honesty as music); earned epiphany avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV stable and distinct; perceptual signature lyrical and character-specific (clock scribe's attention to gears, time); rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose dense with high information density; rhythmic variety supports accumulation; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story, character, atmosphere without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Organic synthesis of elements feels inevitable; specific details (quartz forecourt, glacial hush) avoid template plots; emotional truth grounded in character; risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
