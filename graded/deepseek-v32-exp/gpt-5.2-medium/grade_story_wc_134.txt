<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong characterization with clear motives and interiority; Lan's internal conflict and Sera's earned realization show depth. However, Lan's motivation ("his motive had always been Sera's") is slightly told rather than fully dramatized, slightly limiting emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Plot is causal and cohesive with a clear orientation; closure lands with cost as the force departs and Sera's perception changes. The hybrid lens (primarily causal) holds, and the cave's constraints shape the final image decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated and constrains choices; the cave's musical properties, overlapping shadows, and pearl directly pressure characters and charge the final image with sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early; escalation through the force's inhabitation tightens options, driven by protagonist agency. Cost is legible in Lan's struggle and the changed music, with a meaningful trade-off at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of everyday magic emerges naturally from events and images; subtext in "bright darkness" and tuning avoids moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with lyrical voice; distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping, and elision (e.g., cave mechanics) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density and varied rhythm; minor overwriting in phrases like "bright darkness" slightly mutes clarity, but no loops or artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of tropes into a fresh, inevitable whole; the musical cave and unseen forces are transformed through specific detail and character choice, with lyrical risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
