<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mina's interiority is concrete and embodied (the hard loaf as "proof that memory could be edible"). Her contradictory impulses—observant yet complicit—culminate in a confession and the earned, costly choice to plant seeds. Sada's "heuristically gentle" trait is demonstrated through action and subtext. The final micro-choice (kneeling to plant) reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly: pattern of erasure (bakery, streetlights) builds to a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at the secret tea house. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual and emotional cost in the final image of the sprout. Orientation is swift and clear; the sketch functions as a taught pattern that pays off. The confession acts as a meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is essential, not backdrop. The overgrown courtyard and salvaged-door tables constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered (the bread's "faintest sweetness," the fountain bowl that "smelled clean anyway"). Spatial choreography is coherent, and the micro-setting (the fountain planter) becomes the site of the decisive action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving memory/mercy against systemic erasure) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens: Mina's confession is a self-imposed complication that deepens the conflict and leads directly to her reparative action. The cost—her shame and the risk of the footsteps—is legible on the page and forecloses a path of passive observation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (finding the sacred, the cost of complicity, tenuous repair) emerges wholly from concrete particulars—the bricked door, the hard loaf, the seeds. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture (breaking the bread, pulling back the tarp). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the sprout, reweighting prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable, single, and distinct. The voice carries a precise perceptual signature ("a creeping normality noticer," "the palace breathe as if it remembered harvests"). Diction and rhythm modulate beautifully with pressure, compressing in tense moments ("When footsteps scraped... the tea house went dark"). Sada's dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying significant subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and propulsive. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("bread... wrapped in cloth like a relic," "small green arguments against forgetting"). Minor quibble: "heuristically gentle" is a slightly abstract formulation within an otherwise embodied narrative. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts that obscure causality or dull the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of "guerrilla gardening" as spiritual and political resistance is fresh and non-obvious. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded detail and a deeply personal moral calculus (Mina's confession). The final reconfiguration (sprout at the bakery) feels inevitable in hindsight, born from established pattern and character choice.</comment>
