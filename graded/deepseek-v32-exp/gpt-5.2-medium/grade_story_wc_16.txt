<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation (restore trust) is clear, rooted in her "carefully reckless" trait, and intensifies under the pressure of the ritual. Internal conflict (fear vs. hope) and embodied emotion ("the discord stung each listener with the same shame") are concrete. Her final choice to hand the ink well to Ilyon is an earned, micro-choice that reveals a shift in hierarchy of values, with the cost of her prior secrecy legibly paid.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly: secrecy creates distrust, prompting the ritual, which forces confession and a reconfigured understanding of the codex. Orientation is immediate and clear. Closure is a Decisive Change—the team's new pledge and shared ink well—with felt cost (the sting of discord, the poison of tested silence) legible on the page in the chord's harshness and Ilyon's wince.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Extinct Language Archive is more than backdrop; its lowest vault with "cedar oil and old arguments" is the crucible for the ritual. The cold quartz lamp, clay tablets, and specifically the glass ink well are micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Mara's professional POV, elevating it from ornament to engine.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring trust) escalates cleanly under the causal lens via Mara's agency: arranging the ritual, conducting the pledges, tracing the script. The tightening is the music's turn to discord, a direct, on-page cost that tests and reweights the stake. The final revelation about the codex's true power deepens the conflict, moving it from personal to systemic, but the primary escalation remains tightly driven by protagonist choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (silence vs. truth, the binding nature of promises) emerges organically from the core concept and concrete action, never stated. The ink well and promise motifs are fully integrated, reweighted at the end ("to speak when fear urged silence"). The final image of a "new, tentative melody of truth" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, arising from the particulars of the ritual's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and effective, with a distinct perceptual signature ("read dead scripts the way musicians read scores"). Voice is consistently lyrical yet precise, modulating with pressure ("cautious exuberance"). Dialogue is sparse but functional; the team's spoken pledges serve as action. No head-hopping or register drift. The prose texture firmly serves Mara's arcane linguist perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid, with strong rhythmic control and high information density. Minor notes: a slight template cadence in "Silence, in their work, was never neutral; it meant..." and the phrase "kinked and knotted" edges toward synonym churn. However, these are hairline slips that do not obscure causality or dull the closure image. Sentence-level propulsion is excellent, especially in the ritual sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of linguistic magic, truth-as-music, and a ritual of interconnected promises feels fresh and specific, not a template. The "arcane linguist" profession and the codex's true function (erasing spaces between promises) are non-obvious turns that feel inevitable in hindsight. The story commits fully to its premise, with emotional truth and specificity anchoring its conceptual risks.</comment>
