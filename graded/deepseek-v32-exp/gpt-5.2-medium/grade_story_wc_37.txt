<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lysa's gift/wound is concretely embodied through her memory trades and micro-choices (weaving for communities, swaddling infants). The final stance—choosing her losses—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. However, the emotional progression is somewhat tidy, and internal contradiction is more stated than dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: dying realm → woven dawns → closure with cost. Orientation is immediate, lens holds, and the persistent constraint of memory trade-off shapes tactics. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (Lysa remains scattered, but chooses her losses).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The alchemical greenhouse and mica window are not just vivid; they constrain choice (the window aligns the cloth) and charge the final image. Sensory details are filtered through Lysa's urgency, and setting rules are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (dying realm) escalate as night tightens, countered by Lysa's agency (weaving, swaddling). Cost is legible in her memory trade-off and the communal sacrifice. One meaningful tightening (the night fighting back) forces a higher-stakes choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory versus communal healing emerges from concrete events and images, not statement. The final image of woven dawns binding neighbors offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice. Perceptual signature is strong (filtered through Lysa's memory-keeper bias). No head-hopping; rhythmic control heightens pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of loops or scaffold. High information density with precise figurative language. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the weaving climax without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes memory magic, alchemy, and communal healing in a fresh, inevitable way. Emotional truth is specific, avoiding clichés. The story commits fully to its premise and follows implications without retreat.</comment>
