<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora's interiority and backstory are concretely woven into her present choices, with embodied emotion and a credible arc. Her cautious exuberance is shown through adaptive tactics, and the final breakthrough is earned by her patient, choice-based approach. Minor deduction for some idealization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain clean; Liora's decision to use the eclipse follows from prior attempts and leads to Mara's response. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (shared vulnerability). Orientation is immediate and stable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (Sage Ridge, Dreaming Roots, eclipse) is vividly sensory and actively shapes choices—the grove's hush and the eclipse's totality become the crucible for the climax, charging the final image with atmospheric cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (Mara's silence) escalate through Liora's adaptive methods, culminating in the high-risk eclipse moment; the turn is driven by Liora's agency and pays off with a visible cost (emotional exposure).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of "ordinary magic" emerges through particulars (locket, music, eclipse) without statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer about grief and love braided, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV of Liora is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, professional-perceptual signature; dialogue is sparse but natural, and voice remains controlled under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied syntax and purposeful figurative language; no loops or artifacts; information density high and propulsion maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of music therapy, grief, and celestial event feels inevitable; specific details (kalimba, locket, dreaming roots) avoid cliché and heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
