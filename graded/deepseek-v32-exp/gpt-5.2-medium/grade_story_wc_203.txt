<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation and observant trait drive concrete choices; interiority is embodied through dust patterns and ghostly engagement. Final choice to carry the barrel as a "weightless burden" is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the closing image. Slight limitation: internal conflict is minimal, but the character's specific skill set and promise anchor the stake.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in "responsibility without a body" and the barrel warming like a small heart. Orientation is clear within 120 words; causal chain from observation to discovery is tight and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice (jammed entrance, dust patterns, cracks). The abandoned circus ticket office and its micro-details (ceiling void, control cabinet) pressure tactics and charge the final image of the building's scars. Sensory selection reflects the protagonist's professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("discover what ceilings hide") escalates through protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens—dust analysis, ghost engagement, and mechanical discovery each deepen the mystery. Cost is visible in the taken burden and the marked crack, foreclosing the ghost's lingering with a felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of hidden history and responsibility emerge through concrete particulars (cracks, mainspring barrel, ghosts' silent pointing). Final image reweights the premise without moralizing; the barrel as a "small heart" and sealing the "leak between eras" offer a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—observant, technical, yet lyrical. Voice modulates with pressure (fluorescent buzz to quiet) and controls psychic distance. No dialogue, but ghost communication through gesture aligns with the voice's economy and subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmically varied, with high information density and no scaffolding or figurative muddle. Sentences accelerate and breathe in step with investigation; final lines achieve resonant propulsion. No artifacts that obscure causality or dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elevator technician and ghost-seer in an abandoned circus setting feels organic and inevitable. The core concept of cracks transforms through specific, grounded choices that shape stakes and closure. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
