<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maro’s involuntary truthfulness is a consistent trait that drives key choices, with embodied interiority and a credible final revelation earned by prior causality. Sela provides secondary pressure, and their status shift under pressure is legible. No diagnostic label-speak; micro-choices reveal values under cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from riddle to tower to truth-speaking. Orientation is clear within 120 words. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—Sela’s published fault and restored power—and the involuntary truthfulness constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective—toll booth, lightning tower, lacquer box—with sensory details filtered through Maro’s wonder-seeking POV. The box and tower constrain choice and charge the final image; object-as-setting is indispensable for the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring power and truth) escalates via Maro’s agency: keeping the box, seeking the tower, speaking the truth. Cost is unmistakable in Sela’s admission and public disclosure. One meaningful tightening under causal lens, with no coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth and wonder emerges organically from events—drone failure, riddle, truth-speaking—without moralizing. The final line (“truth, once spoken, can make honey of thunder”) offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material, though it skirts explicitness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—Maro’s candid, wonder-attuned voice. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (Sela’s laughter, confession). No head-hopping; prose rhythm and diction reflect character under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence openings and no scaffold or loops. Figurative language (“eyes flat as coins,” “thunder nets like veils”) is consistent and purposeful. Information density high; closure beat is clear and uncluttered by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of drone beehive failure, involuntary truthfulness, and riddle-driven plot feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific details (lacquer box, matchbox) and emotional truth; risk-taking in premise heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
