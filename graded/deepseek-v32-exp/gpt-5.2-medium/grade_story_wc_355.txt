<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lio's pacifism and descriptive ear are embodied in micro-choices like refusing to pry the diary and using the resonator; his final action to replace the fireworks is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the restored trust and forgiven quarrel.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from the diary's opening to the fireworks swap; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) where "post-firework silence, glitter settling, quarrels forgiven" lands with felt cost and reweights the silence motif.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The shadowed workshop, diary, and resonator function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory details like "paper-dry scent of smoke and lavender" are filtered through Lio's POV and propel the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lio's agency: from cataloging silence to preventing disaster via the diary's revelation; cost is legible in the risk averted and the emotional reconciliation, all under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of empathy emerges through particulars—the locked clasp as solidified silence, the resonator tuning to hidden frequencies—and resolves in a non-literal image of "learning the reasons hidden under sound" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature ("Catalog of Silences" entries, poetic descriptions); voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping, and dialogue (e.g., reading aloud) is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsionary with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language ("solidified silence between them") is consistent and purposeful, and rhythm varies naturally to support the emotional arc.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cataloging silence, resonator technology, and pyrotechnic danger feels inevitable; the pacifist's approach transforms familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices that heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
