<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orren's survivor guilt and rhythmic intuition are concretely embodied through memory and gesture; his final realization that the empty slot is a question, not a loss, is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the bench's thunder-like tremor and the child's bright vibration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly; orientation anchored early; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the empty slot's meaning is reweighted, with cost legible in the final image of "wordless, measurable song."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory and tuning forks function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory details (frost flowers, pulsing lamps) are selective, vivid, and filtered through Orren's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Orren's agency under the Accumulative lens: his proposal to use forks as calibrators tightens the stake from personal memory to communal healing, with cost unmistakable in the bench vibrations and emotional heat patterns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from silence, loss, and translation; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the tuning fork case and the glow of "wordless, measurable song," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited to Orren remains stable; voice has a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature ("listened with skin and light"); silent expressiveness and written dialogue are purposeful and legible under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with zero loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally ("frost flowers blooming between glass layers"); figurative language is consistent and clarity is upheld even in peak beats like the child's flinch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise of a post-noise world is fresh and fully committed; the synthesis of heat-mapping, tuning forks, and silent communication feels inevitable and heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, with risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative structure.</comment>
