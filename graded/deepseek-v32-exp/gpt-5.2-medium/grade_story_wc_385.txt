<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her from investigation to confrontation. Her perceptiveness and emotional connection to Senn are embodied in micro-choices like singing the counter-phrase, and the final joining of shells is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal plot with coherent escalation from inciting incident to climax. Closure lands decisively with the freeing of echoes and the promise to restore stolen voices, cost legible in Senn's pain and the unraveling web.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is integral, from the Hollow Canyons to the luminous-thread chamber, constraining choices and charging the final image where the canyon answers with kinder returns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through progressive disclosure from the shell, tightening with each revelation. Lira's agency in singing the counter-phrase forces the climax, with cost visible in the spilled voices and Mael's betrayal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of stolen identity and echo as theft of self emerges through action and image, culminating in the joined shell singing origins without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV with lyrical, perceptive voice stable throughout; diction and rhythm heighten pressure, as in "reed-blown melancholy" becoming a promise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of echo magic and intrigue feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical world-building pays off in emotional truth.</comment>
