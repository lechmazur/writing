<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marn's whimsical tinkerer persona is concretely embodied through specific tools and actions; his micro-choice to involve the keepers after mechanical failure reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost in his lighter pockets. Interiority is shown through his belief in dreams and listening to wood, avoiding stock phrasing. The final renunciation—handing over the crank—is earned by prior causality and forecloses his solitary path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from summoning to remedy; orientation is immediate with dawn, arbor, and Marn's arrival. Closure lands on-page as a decisive change: trees bear fruit, moon sets, and keepers sing, with cost legible in "his pockets lighter" and the transfer of the tool. The alignment constraint shapes tactics throughout, and the cost proof test is satisfied.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly selective—verdant arbor, harvest moon, stone circle—and pressures choices via the alignment timeframe. The vine tendril as micro-setting constrains Marn's contraption and charges the final image by closing the trunk scar. Sensory detail (clinking gears, damp moonlight) is purposeful and filtered through Marn's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring harvest) is signaled early and escalates through Marn's agency: his solo attempt fails, prompting him to involve the keepers, which tightens options. The cost is unmistakable in his depleted pockets and the communal effort required. Under the causal lens, pressure coheres and reweights the stake with a meaningful turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of technology vs. tradition emerges organically from Marn's mechanical failure and the need for communal song; subtext operates through action rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the tool is no longer only his, and the grove stays holy through practiced memory, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—Marn's tinkerer lens colors descriptions like "captured starlight" and "harp from a dream." Voice is consistent and rhythmic, modulating with emotional intensity without head-hopping. Purposeful compression (e.g., "patient breath") is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; metaphors like "spider silk draws mist" are coherent and purposeful. Line-level craft is flawless, with clear propulsion and strategic telling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of whimsical tinkering and sacred ritual feels inevitable in hindsight; specific details (bent gears, seed pearls) anchor freshness. Risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the core premise is transformed through grounded character choices and a non-obvious resolution.</comment>
