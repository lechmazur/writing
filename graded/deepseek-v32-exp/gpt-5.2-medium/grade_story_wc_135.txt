<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is concretely embodied in micro-choices like spacing intervals and showing the valve; her reactive vision drives the plot with visible cost, and the final compilation is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly; mosaic shards teach pattern early; closure lands with Charged Poise (trumpet note as invitation) and felt cost in silence and assembled meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory details (wet salt, crushed lime) are selective and purposeful; the valve and harbor function as micro-setting that constrain choices and charge the final image with tangible pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (compiling meaning from absence) escalates via Mara's agency—spacing meetings, assembling townsfolk—and cost is legible in the emotional toll and final tremulous invitation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the valve and intervals; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (sound and silences both compile meaning) without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mara; voice has a distinct archival perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with zero loops or scaffold; sentence-level propulsion varies naturally; figurative language is precise and heightens closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of memory, absence, and archival work feels inevitable; risk-taking in mosaic structure and quiet closure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
