<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara's grief and gradual healing are embodied through specific, concrete details; her micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, and her final stance is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with felt cost (loosening of hunger for oblivion); orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The observatory is a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and filtered through Mara's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief vs. purpose) escalates through Mara's agency in helping Lysa; cost is legible in the sprout as verdict and her internal shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images (coffin pendants, basil sprout) without moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("bloom was a craft").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; voice is distinct, lyrical, and reflects Mara's perception; rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
