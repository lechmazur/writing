<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lio's "logically emotional" trait is concretely embodied in his calculation of tide tables and emotional response to gulls; his final choice to return the key is earned by prior causality and shows a visible cost in the trader's confession. The trader's sudden, triggered confession feels organic to the sonic absolution concept, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Minor deduction for lack of contradictory impulses in Lio's stance during the conflict, but his micro-choices under pressure reveal a clear hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate and vivid. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with legible cost: the trader's confession "drain[s] into the sound like blood into bandage," and Lio's endurance forecloses theft with a felt emotional price. The lighthouse beam's "slow, pale blessing" crystallizes the reconfiguration without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is not just atmospheric but constrains choice: the dock's vibrations enable vibrational matching, and the fleeting sunset applies time pressure. The final image—lighthouse beam over faces—is charged by the setting's sensory particulars ("copper between shards of blue-white ice").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect relic) escalates cleanly from offer to lunge to Lio's adaptive response; agency rests entirely on Lio's sonic intervention. Cost is unmistakable in the trader's melted-eye confession and the thieves' "new quiet." One meaningful tightening (the lunge) forces a higher-stakes choice that narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sonic absolution emerges through concrete action and image, not statement; the final "shared hum, fleshly ethereal" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to forgiveness. Subtext operates in gesture (the key returned as weight) and silence (thieves' embarrassment). No moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that blends engineer's precision ("calculated tide tables") and lyrical sensitivity ("bone remembered bone"). Voice modulates under pressure without register drift; purposeful compression ("fleshly ethereal") pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without scaffold or loops; figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("air tasted of metal and winter apples"). Rhythm accelerates and breathes with scene needs; no mixed metaphors or template cadence. Information density is high, every sentence advances story or atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lighthouse engineering, sonic absolution, and vibrational matching feels organic and inevitable; the concept transforms the trope of guardian vs. thief through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious angle.</comment>
