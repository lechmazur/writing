<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sera's interiority is concrete and rooted in past trauma; her "operatively gentle" style is demonstrated through micro-choices (showing burn scars, adding her map). The final understanding of peace as daily labor is earned by the ritual's cost. Secondary characters apply pressure and reveal distinct values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Sera redefines peace as daily labor; causal linkage is tight throughout the ritual; orientation is immediate; the persistent constraint of the ritual shapes tactics and the final image carries cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ancient terrace and celestial bodies are integral to the ritual, constraining choices (solstice line, altar) and charging the final image of drifting ash. Sensory details (lantern smoke, bronze masks) are selective and filtered through Sera's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Sera's agency under a causal lens: the ritual corners the delegates into sacrifices and vows. The dominant stake (lasting peace) tightens through the burning of cherished items, with cost legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of redemption and peace as labor emerges through the ritual's particulars, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("peace was not forgiveness, only the daily labor") that reweights prior sacrifices.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with a distinct lyrical voice; perception is filtered through Sera's professional and personal biases. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext (Maro's snort, Odran's hesitation).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("the terrace tilt as if the sky itself judged her"). Sentence structures vary to match tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of a peace negotiator using ritual sacrifice is fresh and organically synthesized. The ending's nuanced understanding of peace as daily labor feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
