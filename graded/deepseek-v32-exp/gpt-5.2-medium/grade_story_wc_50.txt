<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ivo's reflective nature and peripheral focus are concrete and consistent, driving his choices under pressure. His desire to "store wonder" is dramatized through his meticulous work, and the final act of carrying the chorus feels earned. Slight deduction for lack of vivid internal contradiction during peak stress, but micro-choices reveal a clear hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the timer holds the harvested echoes and the cavern exhales, with cost legible in that relief. Orientation is immediate, structure is a single, coherent scene with a meaningful tightening from problem to solution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The marble cavern is indispensable, acting as a micro-setting that constrains choice (reflection angles dictate the solution) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into Ivo's goal-directed action, evolving causally with his understanding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (storing wonder vs. cavern's overflow) escalate through Ivo's agency as he diagnoses the "overflow" and rebuilds the escapement. A single meaningful tightening—from study to active intervention—forecloses other options, with cost visible in the cavern's relief and the contained chorus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of preserving wonder within reason emerges organically through action and image, avoiding statement. The final image of the timer holding a "gentle chorus" offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the prior material without moralizing. Subtext in the harvested echoes deepens the theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature (peripheral attention, metal "remembering"). Lyrical, reflective voice is controlled and consistent, modulating naturally with the contemplative pressure. No head-hopping; all elision feels purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is densely poetic with strong rhythmic control and high information density. A slight tendency toward ornate phrasing ("store wonder in the cellar of reason") nudges it away from the highest band, but there are no coherence-breaking artifacts, loops, or momentum drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of locksmith, timer, and echo-harvesting concepts feels inevitable and fresh. The specific, grounded execution transforms the premise into a singular artistic stance. Risk-taking in the accumulative, lyrical approach heightens stakes and coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
