<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lysa's motivation is clear and rooted in the Great Muffle; her interiority is concrete through hands-on perception, and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., lashing wire, carving block) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final choice to leave the insulator and share silence-music is earned by prior causality with visible cost in shared stillness. No stock phrasing or diagnostic self-awareness; emotional embodiment is consistent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where silence is reweighted through touch, with cost legible in "promise that nobody is unheard." Orientation is anchored early (hedgehog, grove, Lysa). No causality breaks; the pattern of silence and vibration builds to a resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (siskin alder grove, wet path, moss-covered sculpture) and constrains choices—alder provides material, sculpture's cracks guide her work. Sensory details (porcelain cool and dense, wire quivering) are selective and purposeful. The grove and insulator charge the final image, making the environment indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (creating music in silence) is signaled early; escalation under accumulative lens through Lysa's agency—analyzing cracks, stringing wires—tightens into a shared stillness with cost. One meaningful deepening: her realization that cracks are "records of pressure endured" reweights options. No coincidental resolution; cost is felt in her promise to connect others.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: silence, empathy, and connection through vibration, without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and image (e.g., "empathy in motion," insulator as bridge). Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—world answering through touch—that reweights prior material. Earned through Lysa's concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV (Lysa) is stable; voice is distinct with lyrical, musical metaphors and a perceptual signature shaped by her symphonically minded perspective. No dialogue; narrative distance is controlled, and elision (e.g., the Great Muffle) is taught and paid off. Rhythmic prose supports pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence openings and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("siskins that flicker like moving rests") is consistent and purposeful. High information density; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. No artifacts obscuring closure; peak beats remain clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh: tree-song sculptor in a post-Muffle world using vibration for music. Tropes are transformed through specific details (porcelain insulator, stress cracks). Emotional truth is specific; risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes. Synthesis feels inevitable, and closure is charged by originality.</comment>
