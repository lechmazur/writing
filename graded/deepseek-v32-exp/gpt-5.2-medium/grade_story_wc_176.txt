<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Protagonist's guilt and forgiveness are embodied in concrete choices; final decision to cast and share the sound is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("making a chord that did not accuse"). Interiority is specific and profession-filtered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing of forgiveness with cost legible in the final image of the bronze strip. Orientation is immediate, and the persistent constraint of "technically gentle" shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting (ice sanctum, aurora, rope) actively constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, e.g., "breath sounded like filings in a bell." Micro-setting (rope, card) functions as environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's agency in reconfiguring the rope under accumulative lens; cost is felt in the emotional release and the physical labor. One meaningful tightening forecloses the option of leaving names lost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness as mending emerges from concrete actions and images; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in the rope and bells reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV has a distinct perceptual signature shaped by the caster's profession; voice is lyrical and consistent, with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density; no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and advances momentum. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs.</comment>
