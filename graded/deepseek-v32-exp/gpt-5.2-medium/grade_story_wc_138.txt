<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ilias's immortality and dimensional awareness are concretely embodied; his internal conflict—boredom as cowardice—leads to an earned transformation with visible cost when he steps through.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with cost ("immortality peeling away"); causal lens holds tightly from storm to mutiny to amulet-driven choice; orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite and solar storm create a vivid, pressure-filled environment that constrains navigation and charges the final image; the amulet fragment acts as a micro-setting that reshapes the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering after goodbye) escalates through Ilias's agency under the causal lens; cost is unmistakable as he forfeits immortality in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of goodbye emerges through specifics like the amulet and overlapping reflections; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; diction and rhythm control heighten perceptual signature, and dialogue advances plot with subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and artifact-free, with figurative language that serves clarity and propulsion; no loops or scaffold, and peak beats maintain high information density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes immortal boredom, spatial mutiny, and magnetic fields into an inevitable, risk-taking whole; the premise is transformed through specific, grounded details.</comment>
