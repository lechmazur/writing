<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ilya is vividly characterized with concrete interiority and consistent motivation, but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; his steadfastness is credible but limits depth. His micro-choices (setting the pane, speaking gently, stone-throwing) reveal a clear hierarchy of values and compel the inspector's change, which is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate; closure is a decisive change (inspector tears demolition notice) with visible cost (the potential loss of the mundane). The stone-throwing method, established early, pays off at the climax, creating a coherent because/therefore chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (pearl bay, prism atrium, pond) is selectively vivid and actively constrains choice: the pond’s ripples demonstrate the argument, the repaired pane charges the final image. Sensory details (fog-beaded panes, creaking beams) reflect POV and heighten atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fate of the atrium/mundane value) is signaled early and tightens under time pressure; escalation is driven by Ilya’s agency (pane installation, persuasive speech, pond demonstration). Cost is legible in the inspector’s admission about the luxury marina and the alternative of paved calm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (value of the ordinary, geometry of care) emerges through concrete images and actions, not statement; the final image of the repaired pane “holding the horizon steady” offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (noticing light, patterns, geometry). Voice is lyrical yet controlled, modulating with emotional intensity; dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext that advances the plot without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and propulsive with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentence-level craft supports atmosphere and causality. The final line lands with precision, recharging earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of a glazier-philosopher using ripples as argument feels inevitable in hindsight; specific, non-obvious details (noctilucent reckonings, plain harbor glass) transform the premise. Risk-taking in lyrical abstraction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity or causality.</comment>
