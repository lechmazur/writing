<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation clear and intensifying; interiority concrete with embodied emotion ("hands shook with a softer kind of thunder"). Contradictory impulses act in scene; final choice earned by prior causality with visible cost in Jonas's shame. Relationship dynamics under pressure force altered state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with cost (Jonas's shame, shared promise) under Accumulative lens; orientation anchored early. Persistent constraint (cork, lighthouse tuning) shapes tactics; cost legible in "he looked ashamed." No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting vivid and selective; lighthouse and cork constrain choices and charge final image. Sensory detail purposeful (e.g., scent of jasmine, "cobalt lighthouse"). Micro-setting functions as integral pressure, altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving whispers' power) escalates through protagonist's agency (learning, using cork, beckoning). Cost unmistakable in emotional risk and Jonas's response. One meaningful tightening under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events; subtext in gesture and image (cork warming). Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through "promise sent gently." No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice poetic and controlled under pressure. No head-hopping; dialogue natural and goal-driven. Rhythmic modulation enhances emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose dense and lyrical with high information density; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language consistent and purposeful (e.g., "like a blue bone"). Sentence-level propulsion matches scene needs without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical realism and emotional truth; specific details (cork, scent garden) transform tropes. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Inevitable in hindsight with authentic vision.</comment>
