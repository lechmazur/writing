<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Nerin's characterization is exceptional: interior contradictions (ambition vs. guilt) act in scene, emotions are embodied ("a brief drop in weight as if gravity forgot her name"), and his final renunciation (letting the light pass, writing a guide) is earned by prior causality with visible cost under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost ("anything held too tightly becomes noise"); the causal lens holds tightly from motivation through observation to insight; the magnetic arbor's field acts as a persistent constraint shaping tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the magnetic arbor above the clouds constrains choices (field snaps a warning) and charges the final image (seed planted in its roots); sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("cold iron and apple skin," "clouds ripple like parchment").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding vs. madness) escalates under causal lens through Nerin's agency (wiring seed, speaking name, facing temptation); cost is unmistakable in the arbor's warning and his decision to let go, foreclosing the path of holding on.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (grief, translation, letting go) emerges organically through image and analogy (script lifted from clay, seed as bridge); the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer by planting the seed and writing a guide, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: third-person limited with Nerin's perceptual signature (analogical thinking, translation lexicon); rhythmic control under pressure, no head-hopping; purposeful compression of backstory interleaved with present micro-choices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is flawless: high information density with no loops or scaffold; figurative language is precise and pattern-taught ("like cold iron and apple skin," "like parchment dipped in ink"); syntax varies naturally, advancing story with clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality is exceptional: a fresh synthesis of cuneiform translation, magnetic physics, and spiritual transition feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking (lyrical density, analogical method) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the core premise is transformed through specific, grounded detail.</comment>
