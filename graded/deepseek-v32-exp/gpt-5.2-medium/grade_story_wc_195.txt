<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Calven's withdrawn nature and desire to capture possibility are embodied in concrete, contradictory impulses (steady hand vs. shaking heart). His final choice to embrace a new path is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in admitting he never truly belonged to his order.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with legible cost (admission of non-belonging) under a strong causal lens. Orientation is immediate; each beat tightens via because/therefore linkage, culminating in the compass and his resolve to leave.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The alchemical greenhouse is a vivid, pressure-exerting environment that constrains choice (cipher trellises, shifting branches) and charges the final image of luminous saplings bowing, making it indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes (capturing possibility) escalate through Calven's agency—unsnapping armor, reciting the cast—which narrows options and yields the compass. The cost of renouncing his silent order is felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (silence vs. expression, possibility vs. constraint) emerges through specific images and actions, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the compass and his pledge, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptually signature voice ("a chapel where equations prayed"). No head-hopping; elision (the murmured allegiance) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent; sentences propel the story with high information density and no muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of knightly, alchemical, and theatrical elements feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the final image is fully integrated and transformative.</comment>
