<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and contradictory; micro-choices under pressure (saving thief, refusing wallet) reveal evolving motivation. Final decision to testify is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds; orientation is clear by ~120 words. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (tossing the baseball, returning to testify). The time traveler's revelation integrates without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective; the underground bioluminescent lake constrains choice (branching passages) and the baseball as recurring object charges the final image. Sensory details are filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (regaining empathy) escalates through protagonist's agency in the labyrinth; final choice between new identity and testimony carries a clear, on-page cost. Tightening is meaningful and coherent under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action and image; subtext in labyrinth placards and final realization ("empathy can be rebuilt word by word") offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct; voice modulates with emotional intensity ("Wonder survived in me like a bruise you keep pressing"). Dialogue is minimal but natural; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; sentences vary naturally. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Information density is high, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and organic; time-travel baseball and emotion-wiping procedure are synthesized into a singular vision. Risk-taking in structure and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
