<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maris's interior contradiction—chaste performance versus defiant action—is embodied in micro-choices (the silk knot, breath as a poem). Her final renunciation (unlocking, scattering) is earned by her sister's backstory and the visceral cost when the pledge "struck her ribs." No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is filtered through specific, pressured perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly: Maris's plan proceeds via because/therefore linkages (hired to entertain, uses access to approach sanctuary, earlier breath mutes lock). Closure is a Decisive Change (echoes released) with visible cost: guests pause, orchestra falters, the governor's phrases hollow. Orientation is clear within 120 words (snow, courtyard, Maris waiting).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is the micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image; its glass, light, and captured breath are tactile. The silver courtyard under snow pressures movement and visibility. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (e.g., "air tasted of old breath captured in glass"). Spatial choreography from courtyard to arch to pedestal is coherent and consequential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freeing the city from enforced conformity) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by Maris's agency under the causal lens: she guides the governor, untangles threads while resisting memory-voices, and pulls the final thread. Cost is legible on-page in the guests' faltering laughter and the governor's hollow phrases. One meaningful tightening (the unlock) forecloses the option of silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete "harvest of echoes" and the "lullaby of conformity" without statement. The final image—"conformity's lullaby broke into many melodies"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gesture and silence (Maris's bow carrying "a new grammar of the body"). No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "some frightened, some free."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and deeply filtered through Maris's poetic, observant consciousness. Perceptual signature is distinct ("alarming serenity," "bodily poem"). Lyrical compression is taught and paid off. No head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the governor's assumed compliance is shown through action. Rhythm modulates with pressure (e.g., short sentences in the unlock beat).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density ("starlight fractured into calm knives"). No loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and pattern-taught ("lullaby," "threads"). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating in the unlock sequence. One minor strain: "alarming serenity" repeats, but the repetition is functional as a motif. Clarity and propulsion remain high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of "chaste courtesan," "harvest of echoes," and "prism sanctuary" feels organic and fresh. The core concept transforms a familiar rebellion plot through specific, grounded world-logic. Risk-taking in lyrical density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final image is inevitable in hindsight, born of established particulars.</comment>
