<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's eccentricity is concretely shown through actions like labeling rain; motivation to find where explanations fail drives plot; interiority embodied in psychometry readings; final choice to set compass down earned with visible cost of accepting doubt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal-hybrid lens holds firmly; orientation immediate; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost legible in "accepting that some directions exist only while you doubt"; persistent constraint of compass as warning shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details filtered through Mara's POV; setting from town to lagoon pressures choices and charges final image; micro-setting of lagoon and compass essential to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of seeking where explanations fail escalates through Mara's agency; cost unmistakable in her relinquishment of certainty; one meaningful tightening when she learns the compass's purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of doubt vs. certainty emerges implicitly through images and actions; subtext in hinged awakenings and factory bottling hush; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct poetic texture; perceptual signature reflects Mara's sensibility; rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of petrichor collection, psychometry, and industrial decay; specific details create authenticity; risk-taking in quiet, lyrical ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
