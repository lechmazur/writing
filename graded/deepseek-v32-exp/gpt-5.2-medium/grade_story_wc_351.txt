<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; her internal conflict is embodied (tremor in ribs, hands "chaotically precise"), and her final choice to modify the mirror not to sever but to archive is earned by prior causality. The moment she recognizes the moon's fractured reflection as the eyes from a borrowed memory is a powerful micro-choice that reveals character. Slight deduction for a hint of diagnostic language ("synaptic plasticity") but it is anchored in her method and does not undercut embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she descends ready to excavate, having reconfigured her relationship to the entangled memories from a burden to an inheritance. The cost is legible in her rehearsals and the forsaken dreams seeking an archivist. Causal lens holds tightly from problem (entangled memories) to action (modify mirror) to resolution (sorted memories). Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The moonlit canyon and the broken periscope are indispensable micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("silver light pooling in ledges like quiet water," "tube gnawed by sand"). The environment guides the action and evolves with the plot, culminating in the rock turning "translucent with layered sleeping histories."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sorting her entangled memories without losing self) is signaled early and escalates through a causal chain: finding the mirror, recognizing its function, modifying it, and successfully sorting. Agency is continuous, and the cost is visible in the labor of rehearsing foreign memories until they settle. One meaningful tightening occurs when she sees the fractured moon and understands the mirror is a node, forcing a higher-stakes choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory as inherited network emerges organically from the dream-mine concept and Nira's specific actions. Subtext operates through images (fractured mirror, helix of copper). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: transformation as inheritance, not madness. No moralizing; the final image of excavating under "living names" reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable, close third-person filtered through Nira's engineer mindset ("helix-minded," "measuring distances by instinct"). Voice is distinct, lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control ("She breathed in counts of five, letting fear quake through her reverie"). No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and propulsive, with high information density and varied sentence rhythms. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Minor deduction for one potentially ornate phrase ("chaotically precise") but it is voice-motivated. Figurative language ("moon fractured into a dozen pale eyes") is coherent and charges key beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of speculative memory archaeology, dream-mining, and engineering. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded details (copper helix, periscope mirror). The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk-taking with lyrical, conceptual prose pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
