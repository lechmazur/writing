<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mina's characterization is exceptional with embodied trauma (somatic markers like "copper taste") and credible micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation to "anchor optimism in realism" drives the narrative, and her final endurance is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot coherence is tight under an Accumulative/Textural lens; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) when she tucks the photograph and promises to return, with cost legible in the act. Orientation is clear early, and causality holds without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the arboretum's cliff and lighthouse lens pressure Mina's tactics and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and woven through action, avoiding generic placeholder syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trauma vs. resilience) escalates through the drone incident; Mina's agency in using the "pearl of stillness" tightens options with on-page cost (somatic reactions). Under the Accumulative lens, cadence shift reweights stakes effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images like the photograph and "pearl of stillness," offering a resonant, non-literal answer to growth amid loss. Subtext operates in gesture and silence, avoiding moralizing or abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical yet controlled ("salt wind braided through pines"). Dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision (e.g., somatic markers) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language ("crease lines looked like maps of ruined streets") is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of drone strike trauma with botanical setting and lighthouse lore. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
