<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The narrator’s interior contradiction (professional detachment versus empathetic immersion) and the queen’s embodied grief are rendered through concrete, character-particular micro-choices (allowing the sleeve brush, curling fingers toward warmth). The final renunciation—turning absence into a map—is earned by the causal progression of the projection scene, with visible cost in the narrator’s stuttering breath and the queen's intimate weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orientation is anchored within the first paragraph. The accumulative/textural lens holds firmly, building through layered imagery to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure: the queen’s grief is reconfigured, and the narrator receives both payment and a new understanding. The cost is legible in the final image of the thread marking the skin as a “reminder that every departure can be woven into meaning.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The shadowed garden functions as a micro-setting that actively pressures choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (wet bench, black netting, sorrowful perfume, black river), filtered through the POV’s professional and emotional priorities. The recurring carpet thread and the garden’s spatial choreography constrain the ritual of “projecting presence.”</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake (explaining an absence) is signaled early and tightens through a single, meaningful deepening: the act of “projecting presence.” This escalation is driven by the narrator’s agency and the queen’s participation. The cost is legible on the page in the narrator’s breath catching under the “intimate weight of her grief,” foreclosing detachment and affirming a shared human stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (healing as geography, absences as maps) emerges organically from concrete particulars (the son listening to soil, the corridor of the sea). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the thread as a “compass,” reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and silence throughout the intimate scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature that blends the traveler’s observational precision with poetic lyricism (“dark lantern,” “lonesome splendor”). The voice modulates under pressure without losing coherence. Purposeful compression (e.g., “rumor does not hold a pen”) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and rhythmic, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and clear (“red as a cut lip,” “loom remembering the tension of weaving grief”). Sentence-level propulsion accelerates and breathes with the emotional beat. No artifacts obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The core premise—a traveler writing obituaries for the living using a method called “projecting presence”—is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. It is fully committed to, with specific world logic and emotional stakes. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, and the risk-taking (lyric, accumulative structure) heightens meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
