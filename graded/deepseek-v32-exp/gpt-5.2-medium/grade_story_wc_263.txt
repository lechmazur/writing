<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sel's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final action is earned by prior causality, though internal conflict is minimal, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (exhaustion, transformed city) under a causal lens that holds tightly. Orientation is immediate, and the astrolabe's constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposeful; the astrolabe and archway constrain choices and charge the final image. Details are filtered through Sel's perception, elevating atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early; escalation is driven by Sel's agency in tracing meteors, with cost legible in physical exhaustion and the elders' revealed confession. Pressure tightens coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of creativity vs. control emerges through concrete images and events, with subtext in the elders' sour hush. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via new meteors writing the calendar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is selective and rhythmic control supports pressure. No head-hopping or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with figurative language that serves momentum. No loops or scaffold; sentence variety and information density are high, and peak beats remain sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes stardust, creativity, and rebellion in a fresh, inevitable way. Specific details like the unwritten calendar and astrolabe create organic risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
