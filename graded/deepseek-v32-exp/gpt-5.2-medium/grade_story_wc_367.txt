<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's contradictory impulses (laughter as denial and embrace of power) are embodied in scene; final endurance is earned by prior causality with visible cost (raw throat, mayor's warning). Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (village saved, herald's role reconfigured) with felt cost on-page (mayor's caution, raw throat). Causal lens holds tightly: prophecy triggers storm, steering light saves village. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (lighthouse, glass wick) constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful (wet ink, green light). The wick functions as micro-setting, enabling the climactic redirection of light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under causal lens: accidental prophecy forces the storm, then active steering of light to warn village. Cost is legible (empty houses, sandbag walls, mayor's warning). One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (communication, prophecy, shaping future) emerges from concrete images and actions; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer ("steering light until the coast learned to read hope") without moralizing. Subtext is rich in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical, rhythmic, and consistent under pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., "the coast forgot") is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purpose-driven. Sentence-level propulsion varies with scene needs, and closure image is sharp ("laughing sentinel").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of magical realism, post-media decay, and lighthouse lore feels inevitable; risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded details.</comment>
