<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's charmed skepticism and internal conflict are embodied through concrete micro-choices; her final resolve to seal the memory and build a workshop is earned by the brother's revealed sacrifice, with visible cost in her acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Clear causal chain from inciting incident to climax; orientation immediate; closure lands with a decisive change (Mira's plan to build a workshop) and resonant reconfiguration of isolation into independence, cost legible in her throat tightening and resolved stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (lanterns, humming jars) filtered through Mira's POV; the whispering shell and resonance structures constrain choices and charge the final image of morning light thinning the shadows.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving memory without being haunted) escalates through the shell's whisper and memory revelation; Mira's agency in choosing to archive but not erase forces a trade-off with cost felt in her tightened throat and new resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of isolation versus independence emerges through particulars (quarantined memory, brother's message); subtext in gestures and silence; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in Mira's workshop plan without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Consistent single POV with lyrical, perceptually signature voice; dialogue natural and goal-driven; prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, and purposeful elision (shell's whisper) pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Polished prose with varied syntax and high information density; figurative language ("light quarantined") enhances atmosphere without muddle; no loops or scaffold; sentences propel momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-as-contagion with resonant objects (whispering shell) and a non-obvious resolution (workshop for returning quarantined); emotional specificity and risk-taking in lyrical style pay off with coherent vision.</comment>
