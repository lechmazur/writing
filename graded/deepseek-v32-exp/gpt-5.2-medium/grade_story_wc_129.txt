<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sava's interiority is concrete and contradictory—her "ache of being unclaimed" drives micro-choices (offering to search, weaving reed signs) that culminate in her vulnerable dedication. Her final choice to weave a lattice and ask to be named as maker is earned by prior causality: her observation of kinship patterns and discovery of the artist's map. The cost—transforming her loneliness into active, risky belonging—is legible on the page. Minor deduction: her emotional state is occasionally summarized ("for the first time Sava's loneliness had an address") but remains embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing: the tag is redefined as an invitation, and Sava's lattice extends the kin map, reweighting belonging from inherited to crafted. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pattern-building (reed spirals, kinship observations) intensifying toward the arbor discovery. Cost is visible in Sava's offering and the council's nonverbal acceptance. Orientation is immediate and functional; the pattern of search and discovery tightens cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are indispensable, constraining choices (scanning facets, finding the tag) and charging the final image where the lattice physically links them. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("crater glow," "rain on stone"). Spatial choreography is clear. The setting is a micro-setting that actively pressures tactics and becomes the stage for the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (belonging) is signaled early and escalates through Sava's agency under the Accumulative lens. The search deepens with the arbor discovery, forcing a trade-off: she dedicates her craft instead of receiving directions, foreclosing passive acceptance. The cost is her public vulnerability and the tangible extension of the kin map. Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully once.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: kinship as a crafted, living web. Subtext operates in gesture (Ilya's crystal fruit, council nods) and the redefined tag. The final image—the lattice with empty spaces for strangers and the lost child—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to belonging without moralizing. No thematic echo or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature ("starlight held like water," "luminescent ache"). Syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional weight. No head-hopping. The lyric compression is taught early and pays off at closure. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated ("as if each branch remembered a name"). Information density is high—lines advance character, setting, and theme simultaneously. No artifacts obscure closure. A single minor paraphrase loop ("shared search for an elusive street artist's tag" appears twice) slightly dulls momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of crystalline ecology, kinship webs, and street-art mystery feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes (outsider seeking community) are transformed through specific, grounded choices in world and character. Risk-taking in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise commits fully and follows its implications.</comment>
