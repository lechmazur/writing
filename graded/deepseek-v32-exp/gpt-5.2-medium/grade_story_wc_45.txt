<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rowan's interior conflict as a "forgiving skeptic" is concrete and drives his micro-choices; his final step through the door is earned by prior causality with visible cost in leaving the known world. The changeling girl's brief appearance reinforces his shift without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from discovery to decision; closure is a decisive change (stepping into darkness) with felt cost in determined uncertainty. Orientation is immediate, and the bone-setting constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is purposefully filtered through Rowan's professional eye; the secret garden and maze constrain choices (notebook, tooth, tin box) and charge the final image of the living-branch door. Sensory details like "crushed mint" are selective and anchored in character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth/healing) escalates via Rowan's agency—examining the body, following the map—culminating in his choice to enter the darkness; cost is legible in his forfeiture of skepticism and embrace of unknown risk. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from star maps, mistakes as constellations, and the baby tooth reprise; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Rowan's integration of doubt and responsibility without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature blending medical precision and poetic yearning; voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying subtext in the changeling's candid lines.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold; figurative language ("cleft in certainty") is consistent and clear. Sentence propulsion accelerates with discoveries, and the final image is uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of changeling folklore and medical realism feels inevitable; risk-taking in blending genres heightens stakes through specific details like bone-setting marks and the star map. Transformation of tropes via character-driven choices.</comment>
