<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Marin’s contradictory roles and guilt are concretely embodied; her final choice to write the correction is earned by the ghostly encounter and memory, with visible cost (cracked bottle, gritty sweat). No diagnostic label-speak; interiority is specific and metaphor-driven.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (writing the correction) with felt cost (bottle cracks, chainsaws rev); causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate; the persistent constraint of the impending saws shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (archive, orchard) pressures choice (security system used for ritual) and charges the final image; sensory details (ozone, old pears) are selective and POV-filtered; spatial choreography is clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (apology/forgiveness) escalates via protagonist’s agency (setting up induced currents); cost is unmistakable in the cracked bottle and her promise; tightening is causal and meaningful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect redemption emerges through particulars (shopwork miracles, cracked bottle); final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext operates in metaphor and gesture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature (metaphorical, lyrical); voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping; elision (memory flashes) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense but clear, with high information density and rhythmic control; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and character-motivated; minor density in peak beats does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gossip columnist and exorcist feels organic; specific details (induced currents, perfume bottle) are indispensable; risk-taking in supernatural mechanics heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
