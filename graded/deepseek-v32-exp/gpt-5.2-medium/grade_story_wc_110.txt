<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in fear and compassion, compelling higher-stakes choices. Interiority is concrete (e.g., holding the lens, tracing doodles) and her internal conflict—protecting Eli versus duty—acts simultaneously. The final choice for transparency is earned by prior causality with visible cost (board disapproval risk). Emotional progression is realistic, with contradictions shown through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from discovery to resolution. Closure is a decisive change (thawing mistrust via transparency) with felt cost legible in the final image ("the musicians gathered close, finally freed"). Orientation is clear within 120 words. Structure is a single continuous scene with one meaningful tightening; the plot amnesia and retroactive patch of the lens's purpose is resolved on-page, not a break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the forecourt's "crushed crystal" charges the opening and closing images, and the office/ticket printer environment enables the key discovery. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (whispering stones, desk lamp light). Spatial choreography is coherent. The lens functions as a micro-setting object that decisively shapes the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mistrust vs. honesty) is signaled early and escalates through Mara's agency—her eavesdropping and decoding tighten options and raise the cost of her silence. One meaningful turn (using the lens to reveal the key) deepens knowledge and forces her stance crystallization. The resolution is earned by her choice with a visible price (board's potential distrust).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of secrecy and transparency emerges organically from concrete particulars (lens, doodles, silent concerts) without statement. Subtext operates in gesture and image (the window with no curtains). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material—the "crystal forecourt steamed gently" embodies the thaw. No moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature tuned to Mara's quiet observation. Voice modulates with emotional intensity (e.g., compressed syntax in "Her motive was not greed but fear"). Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven and carries subtext in the final exchange of doodles. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with controlled rhythm, varying sentence openings and paragraph lengths. Information density is high (e.g., the lens reveal does multiple jobs). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Line-level propulsion accelerates with the decoding and climax. Grammar and punctuation are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core premise—a wordless society using cryptic doodles for secret coordination—is fresh and fully committed. The twist (secret project for deaf children) transforms suspicion into solidarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Specific, verifiable detail (etched captions, scholarship children) anchors universals. Risk-taking in structure (single scene, silent communication) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
