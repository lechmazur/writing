<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ilian's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("listened, not with ears, but with the fingertips of his mind"), and his final choice to vow is earned by prior causality (his sister's loss, the slide's decay). The sister backstory moment, while functional, is a touch summary and lacks the contradictory simultaneity of peak-scoring interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid) where Ilian's final vow crystallizes a new, enduring stance. Cost is legible in the final line's "until the last of them learned to mean," scaling his personal cost to a conceptual one. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The frozen library setting is not just atmospheric but actively constrains choice (cold, specialized Lumen Room) and charges the final image (window, cloud sea). Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through POV ("quartz hush," "heat leak away"). The magic lantern slide functions as a micro-setting that dictates the central action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving meaning against oblivion) is signaled early. Escalation under the accumulative lens is a decisive intensification: the slide's decay pressures Ilian to personally invest ("whispered a promise of his own"), which reweights the stake and forces his stance crystallization. The cost is his altered, bound future.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (memory, witness, preservation) emerges organically from events and images (the slide, the vow, the Archive). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Ilian's vow, reweighting "measure" from cataloging to an act of meaning-making. No moralizing; subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable, close third. Voice has a distinct, precise perceptual signature ("quartz hush," "sampling frequencies," "tremble in their light"). Rhythmic control is excellent, modulating from hushed observation to the declarative final vow. No head-hopping; elision (the vow's partial content) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and precise with strong propulsion. One minor figurative density occurs in the final paragraph ("cloud sea brighten," "quartz hush," "fading illusion") which slightly softens the closure's punch but does not obscure it. Otherwise, zero loops, scaffold, or muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality is high: a fresh, specific synthesis of archival fantasy, memory, and metaphysical work. The core concept (luminous vows) is integrated into world logic and character action. The perspective feels singular and inevitable, with bold risk-taking in its quiet, conceptual climax.</comment>
