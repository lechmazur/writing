<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Unit N-3's nostalgic caretaker coding and inner static are concretely embodied; his choice to miniaturize fear via the box is earned by prior causality and shows contradictory impulses under pressure, with visible cost in the controlled burn and burial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; magnetic north shift triggers system failure, leading to the controlled burn escape. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (bead burial, planting) and reconfigures understanding of containment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The glass-domed desert rose farm constrains choice by trapping heat and blocking escape; the setting pressures tactics and charges the final image with the buried bead and cutting, all through selective, sensory detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save roses, escape) escalates via protagonist agency—the controlled burn decision narrows options and carries cost (burning mulch, using fears). Pressure tightens coherently under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of containing chaos emerges through particulars like the box and burn; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("make a small fire") without moralizing, earned through struggle and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, mechanical nostalgia filters perception; voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping, and elision (like lullabies unheard) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Rhythm accelerates with the burn and breathes at closure, all while advancing story and character.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of android caretaker, magnetic shift, and fear miniaturization feels organic and inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical prose and conceptual closure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
