<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eli is consistently characterized as a quiet, listening coach motivated by childhood memories and a desire to foster second thoughts. His actions align with his traits, and his final choice to offer tea and a chessboard question is earned. However, he lacks internal contradiction or flaws that complicate choices, keeping him from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal plot with clear orientation and a decisive closure: the grove is saved. The magnetic grotto as a timing constraint shapes tactics, and the cost is legible in the mayor's memory and the town's changed stance. The lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (mist, cobalt stone, magnetic pull) pressure choices and charge the final image. The library and grotto are integral to the plan, and the window displays become a setting that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grove's fate) escalates through Eli's agency as the synchronized window protest unfolds. The cost is visible in the mayor's recollection and the council's reversal, though the plan faces no major obstacles.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of quiet resistance emerges organically through chess imagery, unspoken words, and the tree pattern. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reinforced by the pawn metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with a lyrical, quiet voice that matches the tone. Eli's perceptual signature is distinct, and the prose rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Polished prose with high information density, varied syntax, and no scaffold or figurative muddle. The opening and closing lines resonate, and the language is precise and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess strategy, community protest, and mystical elements feels inevitable. The humble rebellion concept is specific and grounded, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
