<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Galen's gentle curiosity is consistent and drives the plot, but his lack of internal contradiction limits depth. His final understanding is earned through specific actions like testing sun patterns and aligning the lantern.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative pattern of fractures and the lantern's thrum builds to a conceptual repricing: resistance as refuge until gentle intervention. Closure lands with cost visible in the oasis's transformation, and the inferred lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The oasis and its objects (lantern, chimney) are tactile and constrain choices, charging the final image. Setting is essential to conflict and closure, with vivid, selective sensory detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are conceptual but escalate through increasing fractures; Galen's agency in testing and aligning the lantern leads to a reconfiguration with legible cost. One meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of gentleness and resistance emerges through concrete images; the final line reweights prior events without moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited with a lyrical, potter-filtered perception; voice remains consistent and distinct, supporting the accumulative design. POV is stable, and dialogue (when present) is natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is precise and economical, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, and rhythm varies naturally without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of potter, timelines, and beekeeping oasis feels inevitable. The concept of stacking timelines like bowls in a kiln is original and grounded in specific detail.</comment>
