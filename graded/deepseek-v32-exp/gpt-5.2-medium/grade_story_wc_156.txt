<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara's interior conflict between certainty and curiosity is embodied through concrete micro-choices like timing brush strokes to echoes; her final renunciation ("I do not know yet") is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the charged poise of the ending.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in Mara's response; the accumulative lens holds through nested awakenings taught early and paid off; orientation is clear within 120 words; cost is legible in the "bright with possibilities" image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sound wave garden constrains choices (e.g., clapping reveals cracks) and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's professional perception; spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of curiosity vs. certainty escalates through density increase in awakenings; Mara's agency in listening and using reflected sound drives the deepening; cost is felt in the dissolution of false layers and the uncertainty of her answer.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of sound, layers, and awakening; subtext operates through reflected echoes and nested realities; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "like listening to a map"); voice is poetic yet controlled; elision in awakenings is taught and pays off; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density; no loops or scaffold; slight overwriting in metaphors (e.g., "dolls of attention") but does not obscure closure; rhythm supports pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concept of nested awakenings is fresh and organic; risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight with the hobo nickel and sound garden.</comment>
