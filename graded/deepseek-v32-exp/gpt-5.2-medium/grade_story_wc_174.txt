<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ilya's interiority is concrete and contradictory—his serene detachment masks guilt over stolen voices. The theft of the story stick returns as a tactile embodiment of ethical debt. His final choice (the napkin contract) is earned by prior causality: the dome epiphany and the reverse puppet show test his motives. The cost—relinquishing artistic autonomy—is visible in the contract's terms, and his serenity softens into something earned, showing a credible change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Decisive Change with resonant reconfiguration: Ilya moves from solitary appropriation to collaborative consent, sealed by the contract and dome performance. Causal lens holds tightly (argument → dome reflection → reverse storytelling → contract). Cost is legible in the napkin contract's constraints. The story stick as a persistent constraint shapes tactics and the final image. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The radar dome and story stick are indispensable: the dome's "meteor hush" pressures introspection; the stick constrains choice (as control rod) and charges the final image (passed hand to hand). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Ilya's calligrapher's eye ("ink moved backward"). Spatial choreography is coherent across dome and bar settings.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ethical storytelling) escalates through Ilya's agency: he reverses his art, then tests it publicly. The puppet show reversal is a meaningful tightening that forecloses his old method and forces the contract with Mara. Cost is unmistakable in the contract's promises. Pressure coheres under the causal lens without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars—reversed letters, unstealing puppet, story stick with carved questions—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: consent as collaborative performance. Subtext operates in gesture (offering the stick as microphone) and image (dome's empty listening). No thematic echo or final-paragraph sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited to Ilya with a distinct perceptual signature (calligrapher's attention to ink, flourish, bone). Voice is consistent and modulates with pressure ("meteor hush" recurs rhythmically). Dialogue is sparse but natural; Mara's line carries subtext. No head-hopping; purposeful compression in reflective beats is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated ("sky the color of cold tin"). Sentence rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the puppet show and breathing in the dome. No register drift or artifacts that obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of calligraphy, puppet shows, and radar dome feels organic and inevitable. The reverse narrative structure transforms the familiar thief trope. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates; the story stick evolves from stolen prop to ethical tool. Risk-taking (reversed plot) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
