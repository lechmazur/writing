<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mara's grief and "tactfully hopeful" motive are embodied in micro-choices like brushing dust and cutting twine; her final shift—grief becoming a lens—is earned by the causal discovery and carries visible cost. No contradictory impulses in scene, but her hopeful endurance under pressure is specific and unsentimental. The meeting with Josie crystallizes her motive without tidy resolution, leaving her heart "not healed, but moving."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate; causal linkages (dust pattern → cabinet → button → letter → meeting) tighten under a Hybrid lens dominant at closure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with on-page cost: "her grief shift from a weight into a lens." The lens holds without ambiguity, and the dust pattern acts as a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The file room is a micro-setting that constrains choice—the dust pattern maps absence—and the button charges the final image. Sensory details ("sweated in summer," "sour smell of smoke and river mud") are filtered through Mara's archivist perception. The environment actively guides discovery and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Mara's need to magnify kindnesses against grief) escalates through her agency: each discovery narrows options and deepens knowledge. The cost is legible in the final reconfiguration of her grief. Pressure coheres under the Hybrid lens, with one meaningful tightening (the bundle's revelation) that forecloses her prior static sorrow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of unknown histories and small kindnesses emerges from particulars—the dust pattern, button, letter—without statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: grief becomes a lens, not a weight. Subtext operates in gesture (the button placed like a pebble) and silence, resisting moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices archival details ("rectangle of cleaner wood"). Voice is lyrical yet precise, modulating with emotional intensity. Dialogue is minimal but natural; Josie's guarded question and Mara's answer carry subtext. No head-hopping; elision (the dust pattern clue) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences vary naturally; figurative language ("metal cabinets sweated") is purposeful and consistent. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; closure image remains clear. Read-aloud test passes with momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival mystery, historical resonance, and personal grief; the dust pattern as clue and button as promise feel organic and inevitable. Emotional specificity avoids template plots. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative escalation heightens stakes without gimmickry. The story commits fully to its premise.</comment>
