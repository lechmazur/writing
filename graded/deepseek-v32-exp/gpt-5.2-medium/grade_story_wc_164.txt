<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "felt the laugh curdle"). Mira's confession is a micro-choice that reveals values with cost, earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a decisive change with felt cost (trail reappears after apology). Orientation is clear early; persistent constraints (crater glass, geode) shape tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral to choice—geode and crater glass constrain actions and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering why paths disappear) escalates via protagonist agency; cost is legible in Mira's emotional confession and the trail's return. One meaningful tightening under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (mending emotional routes restores physical paths) without moralizing. Subtext operates through image and action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (Mira's confession). No head-hopping; elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control; no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful ("blues that look like laughter in mourning clothes"). Clarity upheld in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of whimsical elements feels inevitable; premise transforms tropes through specific detail. Risk-taking in setting and tool use heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
