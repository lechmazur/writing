<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lysa's motivation to preserve wonder is clear and drives her micro-choices under pressure, such as speeding the sculpture to counter the Auditor. Interiority is concrete ("shoulders tight with muted vigor"), and the final renunciation—honoring mute bells—is earned with visible cost (Auditor's burned hands, dissolved ledger). However, contradictory impulses are not deeply enacted in scene, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from setup to closure. Orientation is immediate and clear. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the Auditor's ledger dissolves, reweighting the value of wonder with legible cost ("the iceberg fragment burned his palms with clean cold"). Persistent constraints (mute bells, sculpture) shape tactics, and the ending lands with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the bluff, cloud sea, and kinetic sculpture pressure Lysa's actions. The iceberg fragment and bells function as micro-settings that charge the final image with rainbows and melting ice, directly shaping the closure beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wonder vs. standardization) escalates through Lysa's agency: she accelerates the sculpture in response to the Auditor, forcing a reversal with cost (his burned hands, dissolved rules). Under the causal lens, this single meaningful tightening forecloses the Auditor's path and reconfigures the crowd's understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action, not statement. The melting iceberg fragment ("wonder could not be stored, only conducted") and the continued symphony offer a resonant, non-literal answer to preserving color in a post-verbal world, avoiding moralizing while charging the closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature filtered through Lysa's urgency. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but functional (Auditor's silent actions). Prose rhythm and diction remain controlled under pressure, supporting the accumulative effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without loops or scaffolding. Figurative language ("pale rainbows like fish beneath ice") is consistent and purposeful, advancing momentum. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, and the closure image is clear and uncluttered by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-verbal world, bell tuning, kinetic sculpture, and iceberg fragment feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical abstraction is fully integrated, and the core premise offers a fresh angle on art vs. authority, with specifics that defy swappability.</comment>
