<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Father Selo's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; Mara's internal conflict is embodied through possession and memory. Micro-choices, such as Selo's use of rhetorical devices and Mara's circle drawing, reveal values with visible cost. The final change is earned by prior causality, and both characters avoid stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal drive holds tightly with because/therefore linkage from sensing possession to using rhetorical devices to Mara's circle. Closure is a decisive change with cost legible in the trembling ring and Mara's shivering. Orientation is anchored within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of the Anchor's one-color tolerance shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—"ring of basalt bolted to air"—and constrains choice via the one-color palette. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Selo's POV. The environment charges the final image as Mara draws a circle on the stone, reinforcing the Anchor's logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preventing possession completion—escalates through Selo's and Mara's agency under a causal lens. Each rhetorical device tightens options, with cost visible in the ring's tremor and Mara's shivering. The parasite's fight and the circle drawing form a meaningful turn that forecloses possession.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events—exorcism as illumination of assumptions—with subtext in rhetorical devices and the circle. However, Selo's final statement ("exorcism was less a battle than illumination") introduces a mild thematic echo in the closing paragraph, slightly dampening resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV on Selo is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic yet precise, e.g., "decorates with silence, letting pauses hang like lanterns." No head-hopping; diction remains within the focalizer's lexicon, even under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, advancing story and atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, e.g., "air felt like a cloth over a bell." No loops, scaffold, or register drift; sentence-level propulsion matches scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is highly original—exorcism via rhetorical devices at a dimensional anchor—with tropes transformed through specific details like the loop pedal priest and ash blue palette. Synthesis feels inevitable; risk-taking in structure and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
