<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (arsonist vs. archivist) act in scene; final choice to broadcast evidence is earned by prior causality with visible cost—her love "like a volcano turned outward." Interiority is concrete and embodied ("cracked her throat with shame," "tenderness surged like magma").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds; closure is a decisive change (broadcasting truth instead of burning) with legible cost on-page. Orientation is immediate; trail of clues tightens options; final image reweights prior material without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (ash flats, obsidian archive) constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and woven through action ("warm air breathed out," "lamps woke as if waiting"). Micro-setting (tapestry, portrait) functions as key object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under causal lens; dominant stake (rescue promise/reveal truth) tightens through artistic trail to a forced choice with unmistakable cost—foregoing arson for self-revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (burning vs. preserving, love as illumination) emerges from particulars; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via "volcano turned outward." No moralizing; subtext in vandalized portrait and tapestry reweight meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature; lyrical-analytical voice modulates with pressure ("stubborn flowers of paint and wire"). No head-hopping; purposeful compression and patterned elision (art trail) taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High information density with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language consistent and voice-motivated. Syntax varies naturally; propulsion maintained through climactic beats. No register drift or figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arsonist, artistic trail, and archive; tropes transformed through specific grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes; closure feels inevitable in hindsight with organic integration of all elements.</comment>
