<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's serene decisiveness and Elias's regret are embodied through concrete actions; Jonah's guarded longing adds dimensionality. The final reunion is earned by Mara's agency and the record's discovery, with cost in years lost and impending death. No diagnostic label-speak; micro-choices under pressure reveal values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: Mara's actions (reading report, calling Jonah) directly drive the reunion. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (estrangement, death) in the final image of the needle holding. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no plot amnesia or convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting (hospice above clouds) and object (broken record) are integral, charging the final image. Sensory details (citrus, light, vinyl shard) are filtered through Mara's professional calm and bias. The record constrains choice and enables closure, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (flawless goodbye) escalates through Mara's agency under causal pressure: blood work decline prompts the call, Jonah's arrival tightens options. Cost is legible in the trembling hands, warped chorus, and final exhale. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of reconciliation through music emerges from particulars (broken record, hymning the mundane) without moralizing. The final image of the needle holding offers a resonant, non-literal answer; subtext operates in silence and gesture (Jonah's admission, shared hand).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Close third-person POV anchored in Mara's perceptive, serene voice remains stable. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (Jonah's guardedness, Elias's request). Lyrical rhythm ("pulsing stillness of the hospice") modulates with pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and polished, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("shard of night") is precise and voice-motivated. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the reunion and slows for the final exhale, clarity intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hospice narrative with music therapy, broken record as both symbol and plot engine. The setting above clouds and method of hymning the mundane are specific, non-obvious choices that heighten stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
