<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (guilt vs. purpose) acts in scene; final renunciation of resurrecting the past is earned by the sundial's revelation and carries visible cost in accepting "brittle awakenings." Embodied emotion ("stomach tightened") and micro-choices (copying with errors) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: protagonist's choice to take the sundial leads to revelation and a decisive conceptual repricing (from isolation/guilt to coexistence/self-reliance). Closure lands with on-page cost in the final image: "ready to coexist with the living world without needing it to forgive me." Orientation is clear within the window, pattern taught.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting (Tidal Library, stone circle) actively pressures choice via vapor cycles and constrains movement; the sundial as a micro-setting object charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through POV (e.g., "vapor...wetting the stacks until the catalog cards curled"). Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating isolation into independence) tightens via protagonist's agency: the sundial's message forces a choice to renounce resurrection for coexistence. Escalation is a causal deepening that changes knowledge and forecloses a path, with legible cost in the plan that "will crack at the first tide."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (coexistence, guilt, brittle memory) emerges through concrete particulars (moa pairs, stone hum, refuges) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image of self-reliance and the hum in the bones. Subtext operates in gesture and image (e.g., the sundial's light as moa eyes).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinctive, with a perceptual signature ("carrying their shadows like a passport nobody checked") and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates purposefully from reflective to decisive. No head-hopping; elision (reincarnation details) is taught and paid off in the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with high information density; zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and precise ("clouds rolled like a pale surf"). Sentence-level rhythm accelerates and breathes with scene needs. No artifacts that obscure closure; final line lands with clean, resonant syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of reincarnation, ecological guilt, and a surreal library feels inevitable and fully integrated. The premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic. Risk-taking (lyric compression, conceptual repricing) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels earned.</comment>
