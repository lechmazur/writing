<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and her motivation—listening over profit—drives consistent micro-choices under pressure, earning the final realization. Secondary characters apply immediate pressure and relationships shift credibly, though some lean archetypal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate, causality clean through Mara's investigation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost in the letters read and developer's truck idling, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Courtyard and mailbox function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the climax; sensory details are selective, filtered through Mara's POV, and sustain the sandstorm calm tone throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (healing vs. intrusion) escalate via accumulated storytelling and the approaching developer; Mara's agency in following arrows and opening the mailbox drives tightening, with cost legible in emotional releases and external threat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—the locket, letters, listening—without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("listening is a kind of key") that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mara, with a distinct perceptual signature (curator's discernment) and rhythmic control; dialogue is natural and goal-driven, supporting subtext and advance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffolds; figurative language is purposeful, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats, supporting closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise feels fresh and inevitable; specific synthesis of thrift-store curation, locked mailbox, and community storytelling heightens stakes without gimmickry, anchored in emotional truth.</comment>
