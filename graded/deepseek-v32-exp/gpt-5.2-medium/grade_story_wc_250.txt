<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Guardian's silent empathy and girl's guilt are embodied through concrete actions; her confession is earned by prior causality with visible cost (blood on chin). Contradictory impulses act in scene, and the final change is legible and scaled.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a decisive change (girl confesses) with felt cost on-page. Orientation anchored early, and the persistent constraint of silence and light patterns shapes tactics to the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the dock, water, and shutters become instruments for revelation. The dental mirror and star reflections charge the final image, making the environment indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (girl's guilt) escalates through density of pattern and light; agency is shared but coerced by guardian's actions, leading to a legible cost in her physical and emotional pain. One meaningful tightening suffices under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence, guilt, and accountability emerges through image and action, not statement. The final line—"how a star can fit inside an eye and demand to be accounted for"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical, third-person voice with controlled focal shifts; perceptual signature is distinct ("spiralingly calm," "bruised coin"). Rhythm and diction heighten pressure without obscuring clarity, and any elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and flawless: figurative language is consistent and purposeful, sentences advance story and atmosphere, and there are no loops, scaffolds, or register drifts. Information density is high, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of silent empathy, light patterns, and guilt; the dental mirror and shutter-weaving are specific, non-obvious choices that heighten stakes. Risk-taking in lyrical, quiet execution coheres without gimmickry.</comment>
