<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The gardener is vividly drawn with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, though contradictory impulses are more implied than dramatized in the immediate scene. The final choice to plant the sapling is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost, aligning with their role as a keeper of plots.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight and oriented early; closure lands with a decisive change (ledger found, echoes ease) and a resonant reconfiguration (tree planting, night as velvet) under a clear causal lens. Cost is legible in the digging and the emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral—the cobalt silo and tapestry constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details (velveteen gloom, smoke and lavender) are filtered through the gardener’s perception and serve the atmosphere and plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering intentions) is signaled early and escalates through the gardener’s agency in decoding the tapestry. The tightening leads to a legible cost (labor, emotional weight) and forecloses the mystery with a meaningful turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of echoes and intentions emerges organically from concrete actions and images; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the tree planting and the reweighted “velvet” night, avoiding moralizing or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, gardener-specific perceptual signature. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and the prose rhythm supports pressure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic but controlled, with high information density and varied syntax. No scaffold loops or figurative muddle; line-level propulsion advances story and atmosphere seamlessly, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cemetery gardener, chess clock, tapestry, and hidden refugees feels fresh and inevitable. The premise is transformed through specific, grounded details and a commitment to its emotional and conceptual implications.</comment>
