<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deep and specific; Eli's guilt and redemption are embodied in concrete choices, and the ghost bride's contradictory nature is vividly rendered. The final choice to repay the debt is earned and costly, with visible internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot is taut and causal; the bead's resonance drives escalation, and closure lands with a decisive change (orchard awakens, bride freed) and clear cost (loss of bead and self). Lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is integral and atmospheric; the greenhouse and winter landscape constrain choices (heating, resonator) and charge the final image of blossoming trees. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through protagonist agency; the debt repayment forces a costly trade-off that is legible on the page. Pressure tightens under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of debt and redemption emerges through image and action; the final pear offers a resonant, non-literal resolution without moralizing. Subtext is woven through the bride's dialogue and Eli's realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is consistent and rhythmic under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic without loops or muddle; sentences vary rhythmically and propel the story to closure. Figurative language is coherent and serves peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Story synthesizes ghost story, redemption, and ecological fantasy with originality; the concept of resonant awakenings feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes.</comment>
