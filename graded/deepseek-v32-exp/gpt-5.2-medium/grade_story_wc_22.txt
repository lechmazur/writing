<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clear motivation and embodied micro-choices under pressure, but internal contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced, limiting peak tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) and visible cost in the final image of blooming against empty sea; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Jetty as micro-setting constrains action and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through the coachman's professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (garden reclaiming battlefield) tightens via protagonist's ritual agency under accumulative lens; cost legible in the assent and renewed blooming.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of renewal after war emerges through concrete images and actions; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, anchored in the coachman's specialized knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without artifacts; figurative language is controlled and purposeful, advancing atmosphere and character.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (dead languages, bird calls, submerged concord) feels inevitable and organic; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes.</comment>
