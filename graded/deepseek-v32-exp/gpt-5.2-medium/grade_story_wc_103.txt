<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Characterization is concrete with embodied interiority; the protagonist's motivation to "discover the texture of time" drives credible choices. The final renunciation—letting photographs fade—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in Lio's transformation. However, blind spots and limits are underdeveloped, preventing higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; orientation is clear within 120 words. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the halo fragment pressed into soil reweights time and memory with legible cost in photographs turning to dust and Lio's cry. The persistent constraint of fading photographs shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the living bridge garden constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "vines braided into arches" and "river below sounded like pages turning" are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV. Micro-setting (halo fragment, photographs) actively alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (calming the bridge, discovering time's texture) escalates under accumulative lens via density increases—halo fragment activation, maze growth. Protagonist agency drives each turn; cost is unmistakable in the disintegration of the woman and loss of photographs. One meaningful tightening forecloses the path of clinging to memory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images: time as bark, memory versus living present. Subtext operates through resonant imagery like "time here was not a line but bark." The ending offers a non-literal answer in "the rough, tender grain of now," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; lyrical prose ("the river below sounded like pages turning") reflects the narrator's specialized attention. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, e.g., in the maze climax. No head-hopping; elision (fading photographs) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("the bridge began dreaming in loops") is coherent and advances atmosphere. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, e.g., the syrupy air in the maze. No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality is exceptional: fresh synthesis of living bridge, hyperbolic geometry, fading photographs, and retrocognition feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical, accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded details that charge the closure image.</comment>
