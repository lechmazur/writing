<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to witness without judgment is clear and consistent, embodied in micro-choices like not rescuing the refuge. Final renunciation of mourning for decay is earned by the encounter, with cost legible in the collapsed ceiling and spores. Interiority is concrete, though internal contradiction is subtle rather than overtly dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (conceptual repricing of decay as script) with felt cost in the acceptance of ruin. Orientation is early and clear; the swan's folds and refuge visit form a taught pattern that pays off in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (moss, loam, black glass). The library and swan function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image—the swan enables travel, the library's decay becomes the script. Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (witnessing without judgment) tightens via the refuge encounter and the lesson about non-ownership. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency—choosing to observe, let words fall, accept decay—with cost visible in the collapsed ceiling and absorbed words.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of regenerative silence emerges organically through concrete images (composted grief, spores on parchment). Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; the keeper's realization that decay is a script reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, perceptual signature (loose grip on reality, attention to silence). Dialogue is sparse but natural; elision (folds, burrowing) is taught and pays off. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with high information density and rhythmic variation. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; figurative language ("paper softened into loam") is consistent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion matches reflective tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar elements (library, swan, silence) through specific, grounded perspective. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative plot heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure feels inevitable in hindsight. No template reliance.</comment>
