<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara's shift from rigid control to accepting fracture is earned through concrete micro-choices and embodied emotion. The final redesign carries visible cost—relinquishing perfection—and is motivated by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain tightens cleanly; the walls-closing constraint pressures a decisive change. Closure lands with cost (acceptance of fracture) and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choice (closing walls, filament-webbed lens) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through Mara's artist POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under time pressure; the dominant stake (restoring coherence) tightens meaningfully, and the cost of her altered method is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through resonant particulars (threads, Tower card, stitched radiance); the ending offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with a distinct poetic-perceptual signature; voice modulates with emotional pressure and supports the metaphysical tone without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical, dense prose with varied rhythm and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats, advancing story and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of artistic crisis and magical realism feels inevitable; risk-taking in style and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity or closure.</comment>
