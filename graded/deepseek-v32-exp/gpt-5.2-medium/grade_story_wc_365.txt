<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete and sensory-specific. The final choice to amend the log is earned by prior causality (finding the beacon, confronting Jalen) with a visible cost ("the withheld truth lift from my ribs even as its full weight settled, finally shared"). The relationship with Jalen acts as a crucible, forcing a change. Minor deduction for slightly abstract phrasing of the central desire ("the weight of a withheld truth") which leans toward thematic label, but it is adequately embodied in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (amending the log) with a felt cost on the page. The inferred Causal lens holds: the shard leads to the seam, the beacon to Jalen, the confrontation to the final act. The parallel-universe leaps are taught early and their mechanics constrain choices (using the shard as a prism). Orientation is immediate and clear. Slight deduction for a minor compression in the final leap to the "one where my statement could be amended," which is efficient but slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned repair bay is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and supplies key tools (conduits, workbench, hatch). The green glass shard, functioning as an object-as-setting, constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through the protagonist's professional perception (mapping by breathing, tasting choices). Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering the truth about Jalen) is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency under the Causal lens: finding the beacon, then Jalen, each step narrowing options. The cost is legible when Jalen states "you cut my anchor." The final choice to amend the log forecloses the path of continued secrecy. Minor deduction as the escalation from confrontation to the final leap is slightly compressed, though the cost remains clear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme (truth as an anchor with weight) emerges organically from concrete events and images (the shard, the beacon, the bound wrists). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the act of entering the real account, reweighting the prior lie. No moralizing or thematic echo. The final image successfully integrates the conceptual repricing of the withheld truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent perceptual signature befitting a sensory map maker. Diction and syntax reflect the protagonist's specialized attention (e.g., "reading the grit and oil like braille," "my tongue could taste which choices had been taken"). The voice modulates under pressure without losing coherence. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive, with high information density. Sentence rhythm varies effectively with the beats. No significant loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. A few phrases verge on poetic abstraction ("the weight of a withheld truth") but remain legible and voice-appropriate. Grammar and punctuation are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of sensory mapping, parallel-universe weaving, and a personal moral dilemma feels fresh and organic. The core concept shapes stakes and tactics on the page. The green shard and the cyclical leaps are specific, irreplaceable elements. The story commits fully to its premise and follows implications to a coherent, earned closure.</comment>
