<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's obsession is concretely embodied and drives the climactic choice; interior contradiction (hunger to measure vs. inability to trust eyes) plays out in scene. The final renunciation of star-mapping for silence-navigation is earned by Lyr's guidance and the ruined booklet with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout; closure is a Conceptual Repricing (map of silence, not stars) with clear cost (booklet ruined, old way lost). Orientation is immediate; the single-scene structure tightens toward the final image with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting (fort, chapel, battlements) is vivid and selective, constraining choice and charging the finale—the storm pressures the shift to silence, and the pebble bowl/spiral become landmarks. Sensory details (salt, thunder, marbled hush) are filtered through the cartographer's urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping the endless night) escalates under accumulative lens via density of silence-imagery and Lyr's teachings. Protagonist's agency—accepting the method of summarizing silence—forecloses the star-mapping path with cost (booklet destroyed) and reweights the stake convincingly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (navigation through absence, memory as stored storms) emerges organically from concrete images and actions; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures (scattering pebbles, ruining the booklet) and the "ambered hush."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a cartographer's perceptual signature (noticing pauses, measuring distances). Voice is consistently poetic yet precise; elision (omissions, silence) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical but controlled; high information density with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("ambered hush," "pale reefs") is consistent and purposeful. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with the storm and breathing in silent moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cartography, prophecy, and silence-mapping feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise (endless night as migration, direction carried inside) is fresh and fully committed; risk-taking in accumulative, lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
