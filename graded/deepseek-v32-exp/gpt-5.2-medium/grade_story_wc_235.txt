<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with feral nostalgia and jealousy of past selves acting under pressure; the final choice to keep writing is earned by the dream interrogations and visible cost of ongoing narrative labor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing ("I chose to keep writing until the dates behaved") that reweights the punctured calendar with felt cost; the hybrid lens (accumulative/textural dominant) holds through patterned motifs and dream logic, orientation is immediate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful—the birch bark scroll constrains choice (writing) and charges the final image, while the cabin and ridge supply resources and pressure; sensory details (sap, smoke, wet stone) are filtered through the narrator's urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (distilling chaos) escalates through dream-driven deepening: the swap of bodies reveals the grave's nature, and the shift to gratitude breaks the loop; agency under the accumulative lens tightens options with cost legible in the earned calm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (scroll, soaring, jealousy) without moralizing; the ending’s resonant, non-literal answer ("rumor or an author") reweights the premise through the character’s distilled narrative, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person PVO is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "needles dull from old snow"); lyrical syntax and rhythmic control heighten pressure without head-hopping or register drift, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetically precise with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language ("like a page torn free") is consistent and legible, and sentence-level propulsion accelerates dream sequences while anchoring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of lucid dreaming, chronological confusion, and narrative as fence feels inevitable and fresh; risk-taking in dream logic and metaphorical density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity or closure.</comment>
