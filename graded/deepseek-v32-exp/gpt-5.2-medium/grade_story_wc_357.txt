<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lysa's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits (curiosity, resilience-seeking), and her final choice to relinquish the arrow tip is a micro-choice under pressure that reveals her values. However, the characterization lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; her resolve is steady, which limits the internal friction needed for the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (pressing the arrow tip into the tree) with clear cost (forfeiting a personal tool for collective resilience) under a causal lens. The inversion hour and water flow navigation are persistent constraints that shape tactics, and orientation is anchored early and firmly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating arches and inverted gravity is not just vivid backdrop but actively constrains choice (flying by water flow) and charges the final image of the stone tree. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through the pilot's professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding resilience) tightens through protagonist agency: she tests the arrow tip, chooses to follow it during the perilous inversion, and the cost of relinquishing it is legible. Escalation is driven by her decisions, narrowing options to a single, costly act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the arrow tip's evolution from weapon to healing tool, the stone tree with many tips, and the final image collectively argue resilience is a chorus of choices. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature (lyrical, observant pilot) and rhythmic control that modulates with pressure. The voice is consistent, and purposeful compression (e.g., "whirling silence") is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without ornamental loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, sentence rhythm varies with scene needs, and information density is high (e.g., "the air held a whirling silence that made even engines seem like thoughts").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements (orchard planet, gravity inversion, healing arrow tips, echoes) feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyrical, concept-driven style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
