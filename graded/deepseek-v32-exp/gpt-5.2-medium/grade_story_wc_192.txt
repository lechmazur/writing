<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with embodied emotion like "loaded emptiness"; her final choice to help Lio then let him go is earned by prior causality of bridge-burning, showing visible cost in the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Mara accepts her role; the hybrid lens (accumulative/textural dominant) holds, with the fading threshold as a persistent constraint shaping tactics; cost is legible in "loaded emptiness still present but no longer poison."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices via the fading threshold and charging the final image with the "imprint of knees in ash"; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (maintaining sanctuary vs. helping Lio) escalates through Mara's agency when the ring rattles; cost is legible as she rebuilds the bridge only to let him go, tightening options under the hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of cutting contact and healing through scars emerges organically from images and action; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reinforced by the final acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and controlled, modulating with emotional pressure; no head-hopping, and elision (like Lio's shadow form) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though minor overwriting exists (e.g., "darkness could be folded like cloth"), but clarity remains.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of magical realism and emotional truth; the concept of a shadow keeper and fading threshold feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
