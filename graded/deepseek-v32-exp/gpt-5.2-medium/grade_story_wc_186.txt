<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The custodian's motivation—to prove coincidences have meaning—is clear, rooted in a specific retrocognitive trait, and intensifies to compel the high-stakes choice to rebuild the beacon. Interiority is concrete and character-particular ("obsession," "click into patterns"), and the final renunciation of loneliness is earned by the on-page effort. The sole weakness is a minor tendency toward abstract interiority (e.g., "meaning was all I had left"), which slightly limits embodied immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (beacon rekindled, reply received) with clear felt cost (the custodian's "knees shook with thistle-blown hope"). Causal lens holds strongly from sabotage discovery through star-alignment to reply. Orientation is anchored within the first paragraph. The persistent constraint of the broken prism and the hush shard shape tactics credibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The salt-flats tower and glass humming pavilion are vividly rendered, sensory, and actively constrain choice (prism's placement, star alignment from the lantern room). The setting evolves from ruin to functional beacon, charging the final image. The hush shard functions as a micro-setting object that alters perception and enables the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving meaning/connection) escalates coherently under the causal lens: from passive listening to active star-tracking to the risky prism reassembly. The protagonist's agency drives each tightening, culminating in the climactic alignment. The cost is legible in the obsessive labor and the vulnerable hope of the reply.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (meaning vs. randomness in a fallen world) emerges organically through the protagonist's specific struggle and the recurring images of the prism, stars, and hush. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("some accidents are invitations") that reweights the prior search without moralizing. Subtext operates in the whispered sabotage and the answering flash.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature ("listening for any reason the world might still answer"). The lyrical, precise voice modulates effectively with pressure, compressing in moments of action. Purposeful elision (the caravan's earlier passage) is paid off retrocognitively, enriching closure without confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly controlled, with vivid imagery ("last upright needle," "wind combed its ribs"). Information density is high; sentences advance multiple layers. A single minor paraphrase loop ("coincidence begging for meaning, and meaning was all I had left") slightly dulls momentum, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic custodian, retrocognitive curse, and a "shard of hush" is fresh and organic. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character motivation and world logic. The risk-taking in the lyric, introspective voice heightens stakes and coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
