<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and grief is embodied in concrete actions like folding dead cranes, but internal contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene; final choice to split herself is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages; closure lands on-page with decisive change and felt cost (splitting into flame and paper); orientation is clear early and persistent constraint of dream recording shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the floating tea garden and glass basilica constraining choices (e.g., stairway that descends while ascending) and charging the final image through objects like the lantern and cranes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering Jalen's shadow) escalates through Mira's agency; cost is legible when she splits herself, narrowing options and foreclosing a path under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grief transformed through art emerges from particulars like origami cranes and dream recording; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is consistent, and rhythmic control under pressure supports clarity without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats; sentences advance story with clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of detached shadows, dream recording, and lantern making feels inevitable; risk-taking in metaphorical cost heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
