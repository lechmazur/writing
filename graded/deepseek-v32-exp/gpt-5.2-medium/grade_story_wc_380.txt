<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lysa's motivation is clear and rooted in personal loss; her micro-choices under pressure (tying herself to a pipe, chipping the mortar) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final choice to return the memories is earned by prior causality, and the cost is visible in the shift to "lived-in sorrow." Minor deduction for the expositional lump explaining the parasite, but it does not break characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages; orientation is immediate and clear. Closure is a decisive change (whale sinks, father remembers) with felt cost in the final image. The parasite explanation is a slight tell but does not disrupt causality or closure legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the salt chamber's gravity fluctuations force tactical adaptation, and the whale's carcass charges the climax. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("gleaming silence," "salt crystal growing chamber"). Environment actively shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering lost memories) escalates through Lysa's agency: from investigation to breaking the seal to returning the grief. Cost is legible in the trade-off from "gleaming silence" to "lived-in sorrow." One meaningful tightening (exhuming the jars) forces a higher-stakes choice at the whale.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars (wildflowers, coffee grounds, lanterns) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: sorrow is preferable to erased pain. Subtext operates through image and implication, resisting tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, observant voice that matches the character's profession. Perception is consistently filtered through Lysa's bias; no head-hopping. Diction and rhythm remain controlled under pressure, supporting the story's atmospheric tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and polished, with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language is vivid and coherent ("silence shone so hard it felt like a blade in my throat"). No loops, scaffold, or overwriting; sentences propel the story forward. Closure image is clean and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of memory loss, gravity pockets, and a grief-feeding parasite feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Specific details (lantern lighter, coffee-ground divination) anchor the concept in a singular vision. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
