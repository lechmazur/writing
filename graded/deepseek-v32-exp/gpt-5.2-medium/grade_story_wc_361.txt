<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rook's jitteriness and desire to coax wonder are embodied and drive his hesitation and final choice; the vision of Nera, while slightly abrupt, is anchored by prior causality and his memory, earning the resonant renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing (delivery as planting) with felt cost in Rook's relinquishment; the accumulative lens holds, stitching encounters into a mythic fade without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway is vividly specific, constrains choice at the cairn-lined saddle, and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and filtered through Rook's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by the pendant's vibrations and Rook's agency; the stake tightens from simple delivery to planting wonder, with cost legible in the written question and left relic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wonder transmission emerges through concrete particulars (pendant, cairn, question); the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Limited third-person POV is stable and distinct, with lyrical rhythm and perceptual signature; elision (vision of Nera) is taught by the pendant's earlier effects and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic without artifact; sentences vary rhythmically, information density is high, and no loops or scaffold obscure the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of courier and magical relic tropes through specific, grounded execution; the sympathetic-vibration concept and planting metaphor heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
