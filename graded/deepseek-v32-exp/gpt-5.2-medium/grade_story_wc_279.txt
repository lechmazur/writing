<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Inez's characterization is flawless: concrete interiority and embodied emotions drive micro-choices; her motivation to find meaning culminates in an earned realization with visible cost in the loosening unease and smudged mandala, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate; the accumulative/textural lens builds through sensory density to a conceptual repricing closure where cost—forgetting as work—is legible in the final image of shared doubt, with the tile flake shaping tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The grotto, mist, and tile flake actively constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, making setting indispensable to stakes and closure, passing the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start; escalation is driven by Inez's agency via the tile flake and mandala, leading to a meaningful tightening where the emergent hush transforms options with cost felt in the teacher's relief and shared doubt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from actions and images; subtext in gestures and silence avoids moralizing, with the ending offering a resonant non-literal answer through the mandala and the idea that meaning lives while being touched.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with stable POV and perceptual signature; rhythm and diction heighten pressure without obscuring clarity, and minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, transforming tropes through grounded details; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes, and the synthesis feels inevitable with emotional truth, passing the 9+ test.</comment>
