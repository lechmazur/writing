<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's interior contradiction (cautious hope vs. decisive action) is embodied in micro-choices under pressure; her final intervention is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the beacon's shift and town's wary listening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate; closure lands as a Decisive Change with resonant cost (beacon slips, town softens) and persistent constraints (charts, station) shape tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting (radio station, charts) actively constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's professional bias, enhancing pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (who weaponizes wonder) escalates via Mara's agency; her subsonic interference forces a trade-off with cost legible in the beacon's correction and the town's fractured vigil.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (weaponized wonder, cosmic manipulation) emerges organically from conflict; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mara's realization and the shield's continuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (technical poetry); voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping; purposeful elision (signal patterns) taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language ("braided sound to starlight") serves clarity; rhythm accelerates with the climax without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</comment>Fresh synthesis of first-contact tropes through specific lived detail (subsonic frequencies, astronomical charts); risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
