<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation is clear, rooted in the ache of being unseen, and intensifies through the mapping of silence. Interiority is concrete and embodied ("ribs ring," "joyful sorrow threading through my wrists"). Relationship with Aster serves as a crucible, forcing micro-choices that culminate in a charged renunciation. Aster feels slightly functional, but the narrator's final stance is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is established and held. Orientation is immediate and vivid. Closure is a resonant Conceptual Repricing: the final image of "sound made from silence, shared" reweights the premise of forgetting with undeniable conceptual cost. The persistent constraint of the empty camera and sign language shapes tactics throughout, and the cost is legible in the final offering.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The harbor is a pressure-charged micro-setting, not a postcard. Sensory details ("pause after a bell," "hush in rope fibers") are selective and purposeful, filtered through the POV's mission. The camera and sign language function as tools that constrain choice and decisively charge the final image when the camera is set on the rail as an offering.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming a lost name/being seen) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens: the capturing of the foghorn's failure is a meaningful tightening that forces a rush of signing and a memory breakthrough. The cost is felt in the "joyful sorrow" and the offering of the camera, foreclosing a path of passive emptiness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of translating absence into presence emerges organically from the concrete particulars of camera, sign language, and mapped silence. Subtext operates in gesture and implication. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("sound made from silence, shared") that reweights the material without moralizing. The final image is a quiet, earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptually signature voice that notices "angles of absence." Rhythmic control is exceptional, modulating with pressure (e.g., "sign faster" during the foghorn beat). All elision (the father's backstory) is anchored in present stimuli and tilts stance. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and propelled, with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language ("water held lanterns like floating commas") is consistent and purposeful, serving the voice. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates cleanly through the climax ("I did, and in the rush...").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of filmless camera, sign language, and mapping silence into music feels fresh and inevitable. The concept is fully committed to, with specificity that avoids ornament. Risk-taking in the accumulative, lyric mode heightens stakes and coheres, resulting in a closure image that transforms the familiar trope of memory loss.</comment>
