<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rovan's cool-headedness is consistent and drives his methodical choices; his final renunciation (releasing the spike) is earned by the preceding events, though interior contradiction is minimal for this accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant Conceptual Repricing (echo as warning, not prize) with clear cost (spike surrendered); the accumulative lens holds, and the sleepwalking constellations persistently shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is indispensable, constraining choices (zigzag path, voicing silence) and charging the final image (pool, spike); sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal quest to protective sacrifice; Rovan's agency (voicing silence, choosing the quietest harmonic, releasing the spike) drives the tightening under the accumulative lens, with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through image and action: the echo as "lullaby with teeth" reconfigures the quest into a warning against tyranny, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and lyrical, with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "reeds of glass hummed"); voice remains controlled under pressure, and the minimal dialogue serves subtext and warning.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and propulsion-driven; figurative language is consistent and vivid, with no loops, scaffolding, or artifacts that obscure closure; rhythm varies purposefully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (sound garden, sleepwalking constellations, voicing silence) feels organic and inevitable; bold risk-taking in poetic density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
