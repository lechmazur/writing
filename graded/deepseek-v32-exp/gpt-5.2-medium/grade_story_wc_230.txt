<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s involuntary truthfulness is a compelling, consistent trait that drives micro-choices (testing the eye, confronting Lio) and culminates in a credible renunciation—burying the eye—with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and embodied, though a slight tendency toward diagnostic phrasing ("psychological safety") prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; the glass eye’s introduction leads to testing, application, and a final, costly concealment. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where secrecy is chosen over transparency, with cost legible in the act of burial and the phrase "fractured grace."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The hanging orchard is not just vivid atmosphere but a pressure chamber: storms snap platforms, the ravine isolates, and the truffle bed becomes the hiding place. The setting constrains choice and decisively charges the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (psychological safety) escalate coherently from internal management to external threat with the patrol's arrival. Mara’s agency drives the turn—using the eye to deceive, then sacrificing it. The cost (losing the tool) is clear and alters future tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of truth, safety, and grace emerge through concrete action and image, not statement. The final line ("fractured grace") reweights the entire narrative with a non-literal, resonant answer to the central tension between honesty and protection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, analytical voice that remains consistent under pressure. The lyrical diction ("truth is a kind of shrapnel") is character-motivated and the controlled elision (e.g., how the eye works) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly purposeful, with strong information density. A minor deduction for a few abstract phrases ("psychological safety") that border on therapy-speak, but line-level propulsion and clarity are excellent, and no artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of an empathy virus, involuntary truth, and a diagnostic relic feels fresh and inevitable. The concept is pursued fully to a nuanced, risky conclusion that avoids middle-ground hedging, transforming familiar tropes through specific, grounded detail.</comment>
