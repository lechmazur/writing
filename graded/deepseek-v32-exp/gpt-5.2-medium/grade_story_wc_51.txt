<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Weaver's interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion under pressure; final realization of "fear of empty hands" earns change via prior causality. Contradictory impulses act in scene when trapped, and orientation choice carries cost in calcification and soot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with felt cost (soot mark, continued work); inferred Hybrid lens holds; orientation constraint shapes tactics. Early orientation clear, escape earned by teacher's hint, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grotto and lamp burner constrain choices and charge final image; sensory detail selective ("shingled hush," "drowning constellations"); spatial choreography coherent, environment mirrors internal states and pressures escape.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collect burdens without becoming fixed) escalates via grotto's trap; weaver's agency in orienting drives tightening; cost legible in calcified thread and personal revelation, foreclosing easy escape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action—orientation versus force, carrying burdens without collapse—without moralizing; final reconfiguration (soot mark, stars) reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled, diction consistent; minimal dialogue natural, rhythm supports pressure; no head-hopping, elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose dense and lyrical with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language coherent ("whalebone reverie"), rhythm varies naturally; high information density, every sentence advances story or atmosphere; no artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief-work and mythic imagery feels inevitable; specific details (fractal weaver, bronze grotto) organic; risk-taking in poetic abstraction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; transformation of tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
