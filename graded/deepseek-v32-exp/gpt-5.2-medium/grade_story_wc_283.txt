<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lysa's motivation is clear and her micro-choices under pressure reveal a consistent, patient character, but the absence of on-page contradictory impulses prevents the highest tier. Her final act is earned by prior causality, and the collective shift carries cost, yet her personal arc remains straightforward without internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds tightly; closure lands as a decisive change with visible cost (workers' defiance, foreman's seizure attempt). The unraveling of the echo through button patterns is taut, and the final release at the cliff mouth reconfigures meaning with a resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly particular and constrains choice: the amber warehouse, cliff mouth, jar, and buttons function as micro-settings that pressure tactics and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, fully integrated with the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming the prophecy escalates through Lysa's patient decoding and the foreman's opposition; cost is legible in the workers' defiant closing of ranks. Under the accumulative lens, density of buttons and echoes drives a meaningful tightening that narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of shared wisdom emerges organically from buttons, echoes, and collective listening; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—possibility made from time and quiet courage—without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and gesture, resisting tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Lysa's poetic, measured attention filters the world. Voice is consistent and rhythmically controlled; purposeful compression and patterned elision are taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmically varied, and free of loops or artifacts. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously; figurative language is precise and supports closure without muddle. Read-aloud ear test passes with natural variation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hourglass turner, echo jar, and button cataloging feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the premise is transformed through specific, grounded detail.</comment>
