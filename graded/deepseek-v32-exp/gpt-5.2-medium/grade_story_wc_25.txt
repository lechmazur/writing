<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is rich with specific skills and motives; her micro-choices under pressure, like using pre-creased maps and the key, reveal calculated spontaneity. The final choice to use the conduit is earned by prior causality, and the cost of job risk is felt. No stock phrasing or diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal plot with clear orientation early; closure is a decisive change where Len signs the order, validating her system with cost legible in the risk averted. The drive lens holds throughout, and persistent constraints like the maze and storm shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and constrains choices; the labyrinth and storm pressure navigation and communication, charging the final image of the maze listening. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the challenge; escalation is driven by Mara's agency as she uses her skills to prove whispers work, with cost visible in the danger during the storm and job on the line. Under causal lens, options tighten meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of quiet versus loud emerges through events and subtext; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "the maze listen to her softer world," avoiding moralizing. Subtext operates in whispers and secrets.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct voice; Mara's perception filters through her expertise, and prose rhythm heightens pressure. No head-hopping; dialogue is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and supports mood, with clear propulsion and variety.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of geomagnetic storm, container maze, and acoustic whispers; tropes are transformed through grounded choices, and risk-taking in quiet resolution heightens stakes.</comment>
