<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lio's interior contradiction and aromatically cautious nature are embodied in micro-choices; his final decision to uncork the vial and weep is earned by the vial's revelation and his guilt, with visible cost in his shaking hands and the ledger.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change from broker to steward, with cost legible in his weeping and the ledger; causal lens holds tightly as Lio's investigation and mother's memory drive the turn; orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (the Conservatory as site of grief and transformation) and charges the final image (lanterns among vines); sensory detail is selective and filtered through Lio's professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (emotional resolution) escalates via Lio's agency in examining the vial and uncorking it; cost is unmistakable in his tears and the revealed ledger, narrowing options from avoidance to stewardship.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and grief emerges through particulars (vial, pollen, UV revealing); ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "remembrance could grow something besides sorrow," avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature (lantern broker's attention to scent and light); voice is lyrical yet controlled, modulating with emotional pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density; no loops or scaffold issues; figurative language ("crystal shadows," "violet fire") is consistent and clear, propelling momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief, scent, and bio-restoration feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; details like ultraviolet revealing and algae batteries are irreplaceable.</comment>
