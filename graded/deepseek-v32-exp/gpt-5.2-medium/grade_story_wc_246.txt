<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interior contradiction (confidently uncertain) and embodied emotion under pressure drive credible micro-choices; her final edit is earned by prior causality with visible cost when the pen unbends and stars shift, foreclosing a path via contingent kindness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is anchored early; closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change (edit softens signal, constellations shift) with felt cost in the pen's unbending and memory release, shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (anomaly, listening room) pressures choices and supplies resources; the pen as micro-setting constrains action and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (editing history kinder) escalates via anomaly tightening and new signal; Mara's agency in editing through contingent relationships narrows options with cost legible in the nib's resistance and stellar shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: history as a draft, meaning threshed from experience; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the edit's modest kindness, avoiding moralizing while reweighting prior pain.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (celestial interpreter's bias); voice modulates under pressure with lyrical compression; no head-hopping; elision (dry pen) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or artifacts; figurative language ("time pooled like dark water") is purposeful; sentence propulsion accelerates with the anomaly's tightening, clarity intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of editing history via celestial signals feels inevitable; risk-taking in conceptual repricing (contingent relationships over brute decree) heightens stakes; specificity in tools and setting avoids template plots.</comment>
