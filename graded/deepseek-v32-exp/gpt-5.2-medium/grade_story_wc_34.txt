<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lio's interiority is concrete and contradicted (safety vs. desire to be heard), with micro-choices under storm pressure earning his final promise; embodied emotion and hierarchy of values charge the closure without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Lio realizes the ghost wants routing, not resurrection, with cost legible in his hidden need and the ghost's fear; orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly selective (misty courtyard, bolt plate as micro-setting) and constrains choice—the bolt plate’s holes act as a stave for encoding, charging the final image with tangible cost; sensory detail reflects POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (articulating unspoken needs) tightens under the storm’s timeframe; Lio’s agency in encoding drives escalation, with cost visible in his concealed need and the ghost’s trembling before thunder.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (ghost’s code, graffiti, Lio’s quiet) without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—routing needs through quiet walking—that reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (lyrical, tinkersong wonder); voice modulates with pressure, and purposeful compression (e.g., “driftingly alert”) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle—even peak beats (“the ghost poured itself into the marks”) advance story and character with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-in-code, graffiti encoding, and courtyard setting feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyricism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure recharges all elements with emotional specificity.</comment>
