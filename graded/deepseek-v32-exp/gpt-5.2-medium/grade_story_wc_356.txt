<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Jun's ambition and olfactory sensitivity are concrete, driving traits; her micro-choices under pressure (listening, mapping, observing) reveal a hierarchy of values, and her shift from ambition to service is earned through the test, though internal contradiction is subtle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate; closure lands with a decisive change (seed obtained) and resonant reconfiguration (ambition settling into service), with cost legible in the condition to send back pages.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The treetop village is vividly specific and constrains choice (rope bridges, sway, canopy gardens); the corpse flower and compost shrine charge the final image, meeting the 9+ test of environment shaping tactics or closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (obtaining the seed) escalates through denial, test, and conditioned reward; protagonist agency (journalizing, following scents, standing watch) drives each turn, with cost unmistakable in the ongoing obligation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom as an undercurrent emerges through concrete particulars (wrapping paper doodles, scent threads, bloom observation) without moralizing; the final spiral image reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature (olfactory focus, journalistic attention); poetic diction is filtered through Jun's sensibility, and rhythmic control supports pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical prose with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere seamlessly, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of elements (treetop village, corpse flower, olfactory sensitivity, wrapping paper journal) feels organic and inevitable; poetic risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
