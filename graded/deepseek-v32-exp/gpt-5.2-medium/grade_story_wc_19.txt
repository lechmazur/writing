<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's claustrophobia and growth are embodied through specific micro-choices (e.g., "three closed breaths and one open") with contradictory impulses under pressure; final jar-opening is earned by prior causality with visible cost of facing scorched vines.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from father's plan through inversion to collection; closure is a decisive change ("space felt wide enough to live in") with cost legible in the rope-crossing panic and gilded hush gathering.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Trellis setting constrains choice (ropes, niches) and charges the final image; sensory selection ("wind through leaves," "metal and honey") is filtered through POV urgency, making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (overcoming wall-fear) escalates via protagonist's agency using exposure method; cost is unmistakable in panic during inversion and risk at scorched vines, foreclosing claustrophobia with felt trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence as tangible, carryable substance emerges through particulars (hushling, tasting niches) without moralizing; ending offers resonant non-literal answer via jar-opening that reweights prior fear and building.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature ("fear was just air with a story"); voice modulates under pressure via measured syntax, and any elision (inversion experience) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold; figurative language ("sprout upward as if the world had turned into soil") is consistent and clarity remains sharp in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of silence-collecting, gravity inversion, and hushlings feels inevitable; risk-taking in premise heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and transformation through specific detail is fully integrated.</comment>
