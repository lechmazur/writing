<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Iris's motivation is clear and rooted in grief; her interiority is concrete through sensory perception. Actions under pressure reveal character, and the earned change to "steadier grief" has visible cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration: the stillpoint delivers the message "you can miss him and still live," charging the final image with cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory patterns to this decisive moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is integral, with the ultrasonic forest pressuring choices and the pool charging the closure. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Iris's blindness, constraining tactics and enriching atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early as navigating grief; escalation occurs through sensory and emotional hurdles like the brother's panic. Agency is continuous, with dowsing and following notes, leading to a cost-legible climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the mapping metaphor, culminating in the non-literal realization at the pool. Subtext operates through images like the compass ring and stillpoint, resisting moralization for earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature focused on non-visual senses. Voice is lyrical and consistent, with rhythmic control that heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and polished, with varied rhythm and high information density. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and serves the closure image effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of blind mapmaker, ultrasonic forest, and grief navigation feels inevitable. Risk-taking in premise and execution heightens stakes without gimmickry, offering a fresh angle on emotional recovery.</comment>
