<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is concrete and driven by consistent trauma; her heartbeat counting embodies internal conflict, and the final cessation is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Dr. Lyle's digital presence serves as a crucible, forcing a micro-choice hierarchy. No diagnostic label-speak in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (earned stasis) as Mara stops counting heartbeats and feels "correctly recorded," with cost legible in the pause at "six thousand, two hundred, and one." Orientation is anchored early, and the pattern of fragmentation/defragmentation pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting—opal observatory, snow, ink-soaked charts—constrains choice (sensors read ink patterns) and charges the final image of the "winter stars." Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, with micro-setting (porcelain shard) actively used in the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (legal death vs. lived existence) tightens via Mara's agency in drawing ink spirals under Lyle's guidance; escalation is a density increase under the accumulative lens, culminating in a cost-heavy realization that forecloses her compulsive counting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (wisdom from failure, fragmentation) emerges through concrete particulars—porcelain shard, ink patterns, heartbeat counting—without moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer via the "ghost's hard-won calm," reweighting prior material with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; Mara's voice is lyrical yet pressured, and Lyle's dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit. No head-hopping; purposeful compression (e.g., "defragment together") is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language ("sleeping spear," "dark lake bloom") is consistent and clarity-driving. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, and information density is high without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of digital ghost, death-certificate error, and observatory setting feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, and the final image transforms familiar tropes.</comment>
