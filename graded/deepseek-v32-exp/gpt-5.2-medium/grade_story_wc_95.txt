<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lysander's "diplomatically fierce" temperament is embodied in micro-choices (using the needle card, stepping onto the duel strip) and his final decision to have Veller walk the route, which is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The mechanical arm is not just a trait but a tactical shield. Interiority is concrete though not deeply contradictory, fitting the length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: discovery leads to confrontation, duel, and revelation. Closure is a decisive change with clear cost (Veller arrested, plan revealed). Orientation is immediate, and the sundial's constraint shapes tactics. No causality breaks; the ending lands with a resonant image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The glass atrium and half-painted sundial are not just backdrop; they constrain choice (dueling strip, coded angles) and charge the final image (the sundial's line like a baton). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering the plan and stopping Veller) escalates cleanly via Lysander's agency: decoding, challenge, duel, revelation. The duel is a meaningful tightening that forecloses options, and cost is legible in Veller's defeat and arrest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: turning questions into destinations, hidden knowledge as salvation. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the evacuation plan and the sundial's final line, without moralizing. Subtext operates in the coded angles and diplomatic fencing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a philosophical, precise voice that modulates under pressure (e.g., "dignified chaos"). Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, no loops or scaffolding. Figurative language ("drive an argument to the marrow") is consistent and clear. Rhythm varies naturally, and closure is unmarred by artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of dueling philosopher, mechanical arm, hidden musical map in a sundial feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the premise is fully committed to its implications.</comment>
