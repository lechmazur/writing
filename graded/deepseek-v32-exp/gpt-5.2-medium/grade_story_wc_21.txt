<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and rooted in professional ethos; interiority is concrete and embodied (e.g., envelope seal burning fingers). The final choice (publishing with redactions) reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. However, some emotional states are labeled ("woke shaking") rather than fully dramatized with contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: each beat follows from prior discovery. Closure is a decisive change (diary retrieved, past released) with felt cost (responsibility to return words). Orientation is anchored early (courthouse attic, zeppelin library). No causality breaks; the retrocognitive trap is integrated as a causal mechanism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory detail (salt and smoke, kerosene and crushed sea grass). The obsidian lagoon and zeppelin library are integral, constraining choice and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (sand giving way to water). POV filters detail through the archivist's professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering truth vs. protecting the living) is signaled early and escalates through retrocognitive visions and the parley. Protagonist agency drives each tightening; the final negotiation forces a trade-off with visible cost (promise to redact). Pressure coheres under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth, memory, and archival ethics emerges organically through action and image (the diary as a door, not a grave). Subtext operates in the parley's negotiated silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final act of retrieval and promise, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that blends archival precision and poetic observation ("slow, stitched cloud"). Voice modulates under pressure without losing coherence. Dialogue (internal and with Lila) is natural and goal-driven, carrying crucial subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and vivid imagery. Sentence structures vary effectively with scene needs. Minor figurative density in peak beats ("the water rose like a hand offering its palm") is purposeful and clear. No loops, scaffold, or obscuring artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh, specific synthesis of historical mystery, archival drama, and subtle magical realism. The zeppelin library and beach-debris cipher are unique, irreplaceable elements. Risks (retrocognition, psychic parley) heighten stakes and are fully integrated into the story's logic and emotional truth.</comment>
