<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and contradictory; her trait "uncertainly certain" drives micro-choices under pressure, and her final bargain is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the shifted chiming minute.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the final image of soot shaken from leaves and the town beginning again without pretending to know the route.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (gears as stepping teeth in the waterfall) and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's POV, integrating action and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (embracing uncertainty) escalates via Mara's agency; cost is unmistakable in the trade-off from fixed time to chosen probability, foreclosing the path of certainty with felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like clocks showing two times and the harbor fire; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the probability clock without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled under pressure, and dialogue (when present) carries subtext without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; rhythm varies naturally, and every sentence advances story or atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of clocks, uncertainty, and post-fire renewal feels inevitable; tropes are transformed through specific character choices and setting, with risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
