<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's grim optimism is concretely embodied through sore calves and notebook; interior contradiction between hope and acceptance plays out in scene; final renunciation to sit and carry the softened texture is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the machine's slowing and the staircase's widening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens held throughout; closure is an Earned Stasis where refusing to imagine a better landing ruptures assumption, slowing the machine and reconfiguring confinement as honest; cost is legible in "the texture of the missed opportunity softened into something I could carry" and "each one was mine."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Infinite staircase pressures choices via its repetitive geometry; chipped dice and perpetual motion machine constrain actions and charge the final image where dice are set beside the stalled wheel; sensory details like the dice's "tiny stutter" and the machine's click are selective and filtered through the POV's mathematical perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capturing the texture of a missed opportunity—escalates under the Accumulative lens through density of encounters; protagonist's agency in rolling dice, writing proofs, and finally refusing hope drives a meaningful tightening; cost is unmistakable when the machine coughs and slows, foreclosing the path of redemption.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of missed opportunity and expectation emerges through concrete particulars like the chipped dice and Mara memory; subtext operates in the machine's warning and the staircase's architecture; final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer in carrying the softened texture, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature blending mathematical lexicon and lyrical reflection; voice modulates under pressure from "numbers were my lockpicks" to the final breathless echo; no head-hopping; purposeful compression in reflective passages is taught and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, e.g., "a flaw that sounded like truth"; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentence variety supports accumulation and closure; line-level craftsmanship advances story without padding, and the final paragraph lands with clean cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of infinite staircase, perpetual motion, and mathematical introspection feels inevitable; tropes are transformed through specific grounded choices like the chipped dice and proof by contradiction; risk-taking in surreal architecture heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; closure image recharges all elements.</comment>
