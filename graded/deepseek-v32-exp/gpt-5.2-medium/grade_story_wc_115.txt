<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The protagonist’s “reckless” and “religiously skeptical” traits are embodied in concrete action and perception, compelling the investigation. The final choice to call Mara is a credible endurance (Earned Stasis) that forecloses easy forgiveness, motivated by the discovered note and the burden of the truth. However, the protagonist’s internal reaction to the supernatural shift is somewhat observational and detached, missing a more contradictory, embodied emotional spike in that pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong causal linkage from confession to investigation to revelation. The closure is a Decisive Change (finding the note, choosing to call Mara) with a visible, felt cost in the “physical heft” of the truth and the ghosts’ leaning presence. The Causal lens holds perfectly, and the persistent constraint of the swallowed truth shapes the final tactic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through the POV (“air tasted of wet iron”). The tunnel and the valve wheel function as micro-settings that critically constrain choice and charge the final image—the wheel opens the passage, the badge number reveals the truth. The environment is integral to the plot’s causality and the story’s eerie tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the weight of the swallowed truth—escalates cleanly under the Causal lens through the protagonist’s agency (driving, using the wheel, questioning the ghost). The cost becomes legible at the climax with the “physical heft” of the discovered note and the consequential decision to end Mara’s hiding. The tightening is meaningful and the price is visible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (truth, guilt, and the burden of secrecy) emerges powerfully from the concrete situation and the final image of turning the wheel back to seal the bay while choosing to break the silence. It offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The integration is slightly attenuated by the protagonist’s relatively calm, appraising stance, which mutes the thematic friction of their personal involvement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (“drowsy alertness,” “appraise mysteries”). The integration of the radio method is clean and voice-motivated. The elision of the protagonist’s deeper personal history with Mara is purposeful and creates productive ambiguity. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor artifact: the verb “snort” in the tense tunnel moment feels slightly tonally jarring against the established drowsy-alert texture. Otherwise, no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle to obscure the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a “factory ghost shift” with a gritty, psychological crime confession is fresh and specific. The concept is fully committed to, driving the logic of the hidden bay and the “accounting” ghosts. The beaded valve wheel as a tactile, magical-realist key object is a memorable, non-obvious inflection that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
