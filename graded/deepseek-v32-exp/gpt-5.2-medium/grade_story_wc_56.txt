<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses (serene upheaval) act in scene; her final choice to broadcast is earned by prior causality with visible cost (stripping comfort, salvaging choice). Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on page with cost (community's slow turning, loss of comfort); causal lens holds tightly; orientation is clear within window; one meaningful tightening (discovery to broadcast) driven by protagonist agency; persistent constraint (sundial) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting (canal, warehouses, water) pressures choices and supplies resources; recurring object (pocket sundial) constrains choice and charges final image; sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under causal lens; dominant stake (truth vs. comfort) tightens through discovery and broadcast; cost is legible on page (community's shaken faith, Mara's realization of loss).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (construction of truth, power of silence) emerges from events and images; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext operates in gesture and implication (sundial's shadow, recorded instruction).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable; distinct perceptual signature (legend seeker's noticing); voice modulates with pressure; purposeful compression (lyrical density) is taught and legible; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high information density with clear propulsion; figurative language is purposeful and coherent; rhythm varies naturally; sentence-level craft supports pressure without obscuring closure.</comment>
