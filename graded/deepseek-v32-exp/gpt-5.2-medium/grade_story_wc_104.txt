<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is clear and consistently drives her strategic choices; her embodied patience and the chain as vow are shown through action. However, the interiority lacks contradictory impulses in scene, and emotional complexity is restrained, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (seeds distributed) and resonant reconfiguration (grace as plan), cost felt in trembling wrist and militia threat. Causal lens holds tightly; the chain as persistent constraint shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the abandoned carnival center provides the piano, bench, and bear used to impede and escape. Sensory details (tin, grime, cool air) are filtered through Mara’s urgency, charging the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (planting resilience) escalates cleanly under causal lens: militia arrival forces Mara’s strategic impediments. Agency drives every turn; cost is legible in the risk and her trembling yet steady wrist during the escape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of freedom’s weight and resilience emerges through concrete images (chain, seeds, boy’s touch) without moralizing. The final image reweights prior material—seeds spilling into hands—offering a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and voice is distinctively poetic (“moves as quietly as falling ash”) yet controlled under pressure. Perceptual signature remains Mara’s; no head‑hopping; rhythmic prose supports momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“dust rises like a curtain”) is consistent and purposeful; peak beats maintain clarity without overwriting or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of chained liberator, seed vault, and abandoned carnival feels inevitable. The chain as vow/tool and decoding via piano keys are fresh, grounded in character, and heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
