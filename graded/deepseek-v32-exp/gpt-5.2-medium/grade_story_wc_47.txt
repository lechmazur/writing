<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist's shame and proactive redemption are embodied in micro-choices (trembling breath, hood up). Interior contradiction between regret and rebuilding feels concrete, and the final proffering of the pendant is earned by prior causality with visible cost in Jun's fear. However, some internal reflection (“graft new meaning”) leans slightly abstract, preventing a 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with felt cost in the unresolved forgiveness and the image of confession as compost. Causal linkages are tight from confession to archive-building to meeting Jun. Lens (Hybrid) holds, though the final beat leans accumulative, slightly reducing causal drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the moss‑grown data center supplies the drip‑pattern encryption and the neutral meeting place. Sensory details (“quiet that tasted of sap”) are selective and pressure‑bearing. It constrains choice and charges the final image, but Q2’s sub‑9.0 score caps this category at 8.8.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redemption) escalates through protagonist agency: creating the archive, then risking the meeting with Jun. The proffering of the pendant is a meaningful tightening that forecloses the path of isolation with visible cost (Jun’s fear, protagonist’s trembling). Pressure coheres under the hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images of decay and regeneration (data center→moss, confession→compost). Subtext operates in gestures (pendant as seal, drip as code). Ending offers a non‑literal, resonant answer without moralizing. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 not reaching 9.0.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First‑person POV is stable with a distinct, watchful voice that modulates under pressure (“honeyed hush,” “guarding my own trembling”). Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal‑driven. No head‑hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic without loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“like a crowd around a cracked beehive”) is controlled and advances atmosphere. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, though a few phrases risk overwriting (“honeyed hush” repeated). Information density is high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cyber‑crime and natural decay, with inventive turns (drip‑pattern encryption, amber pendant as key). The perspective feels singular and risk‑taking in its lyrical compression. Transformation of tropes through specific, grounded choices in character and setting.</comment>
