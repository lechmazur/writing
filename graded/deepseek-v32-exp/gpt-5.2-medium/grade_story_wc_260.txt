<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's internal conflict is concretely embodied through micro-choices like holding the tail tip and writing lists; her final decision to file the report yet offer help is earned by prior causality with visible cost, and contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene without diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mara pins the shed tail tip, reweighting prior material with felt cost; the causal lens holds tightly from inciting incident to resolution, and orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The misty workshop and chameleon's tail tip function as micro-setting that constrains choice and decisively charges the final image; sensory details like "damp cedar" and "heat lamps glowed like small moons" are selective, purposeful, and filtered through Mara's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens, from listing boundaries and mercy to calling Tessa and taking custody of animals; cost is legible on-page in the trade-off between justice and compassion, tightening options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of regeneration and balance emerges organically through particulars like the shed tail tip and Mara's layered shedding; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, and subtext operates in image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "skin shifting from green to rust as if thinking"); voice modulates with emotional pressure, and dialogue naturalism in Tessa's confession carries subtext without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "anger thinned, layer by layer" is purposeful and clear, and momentum is maintained through concise, image-driven sentences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality lies in the specific synthesis of a con recovery story with the chameleon's regeneration motif, feeling inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in the quiet, resolved ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
