<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mina’s motivation is clear, brutal, and drives the plot; interiority is concrete. The final choice—to photograph the empty space—is a micro-choice that reveals a hierarchy of values (release over possession) with visible cost. The realization moment ("clutched it as memory") is slightly tell-y but quickly acted upon, a hairline slip.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (the chosen luminous absence as a beginning). Causal lens holds tightly; the dream’s return is slightly convenient but motivated by prior effort. Structure is a single, escalating scene with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid, essential, and constrains choice: the whispering archipelago mirrors the cipher quest; the library, palette, and camera are micro-settings that shape the climax. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful. Capped per 9+ gate (Q2 <9.0).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture/release the dream) escalates through Mina’s agency: from routine photography to catching the silhouette, vitalizing it, and finally releasing it. Cost is unmistakable in the act of letting go. Capped per 9+ gate (Q2 <9.0).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (longing, memory vs. release) emerges through concrete images and actions; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in the "chosen luminous absence." Subtext is rich in gesture and implication. Capped per 9+ gate (Q2 <9.0).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and deeply embodied; voice is lyrical, precise, with a distinct perceptual signature for light and absence. Syntax is varied and rhythmic, modulating with emotional intensity. Capped per 9+ gate (Q2 <9.0).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is exceptional: dense, poetic, yet clear and propulsive. High information density, varied sentence structures, precise figurative language. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Capped per 9+ gate (Q2 <9.0).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Synthesis of elements (light-painting librarian, cipher of longing, whispering islands) is highly original and organic. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight; lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Capped per 9+ gate (Q2 <9.0).</comment>
