<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in contradiction; her internal conflict is embodied in actions like carrying the shard and tearing letters, and the final apology is earned through prior causality with visible cost in healing palms and fading condensation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with decisive change: Mara speaks apology, condensation fades; cost is legible in magic ending; causal lens holds with rumors motivating brother's arrival; persistent constraint of shard shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and constrains choice via mangrove roots and spirits; recurring shard charges final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake in apology escalates through Mara's agency: tearing letters, evoking past, brother's arrival; cost visible in healing and choice made; under causal lens, tightening is coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of unsent words and forgiveness emerges from concrete images and actions; subtext in spirits' messages; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature strong; dialogue natural in brief exchange; no head-hopping; elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense but clear with high information density; no loops or scaffold; figurative language consistent; rhythm varies naturally; no artifacts harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels organic; tropes transformed through specific choices; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
