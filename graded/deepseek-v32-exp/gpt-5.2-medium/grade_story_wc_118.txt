<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lysa’s characterization is concrete and embodied, with her sensitivity shown through tactile perceptions (tingling fingertips, feeling vibrations). Her final choice—cataloging and pinning the tapestry—arises from the accumulated evidence and carries the cost of accepting irreversible change. However, the story lacks strong contradictory impulses or internal conflict, which slightly limits depth under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost: the realization that the axis cannot be reset, only remembered. The accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly, building through sensory details and pattern recognition. Orientation is immediate, and the causal linkages within the accumulative frame are seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The silo library is indispensable, constraining choice (the bricked hearth, the window slit) and charging the final image with scaled shadows and humming concrete. Sensory details are selective, purposeful, and filtered through Lysa’s perceptive bias, creating a fully integrated atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes (understanding the displaced axis) are signaled early and escalate through Lysa’s active probing and reading. Under the accumulative lens, density increases until the decisive realization forecloses the option of restoration. The cost of acceptance is legible in the final cataloging act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (memory, loss, and the role of dreams) emerges organically from the diaries, tapestry, and the concept of the displaced axis. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of stories turning toward a new north, avoiding any moralizing or abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and closely filtered through Lysa’s perceptive signature. The voice is distinct, lyrical, and rhythmically controlled, with syntax and diction consistently reflecting her sensitivity and the story’s hushed tone. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and polished, with high information density and varied, purposeful rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. The final image is clear and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise is highly original, synthesizing post-dream world, a historian of walls, and a displaced axis with organic specificity. Risk-taking in the accumulative, quiet structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
