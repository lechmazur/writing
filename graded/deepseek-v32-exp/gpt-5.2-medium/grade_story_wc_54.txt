<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lina's curiosity and functional creativity are embodied through specific micro-choices under pressure, such as pocketing the sextant and rerouting water; her stoic endurance and final understanding earn the closure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal linkages from discovery to restoration to revelation hold tightly; closure lands with a charged poise as the beacon sends and the terminal's lamps reflect like constellations, costing Lina's effort and reconfiguring her purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned terminal is vividly rendered through sensory details that constrain Lina's actions; the sextant piece and water system function as micro-settings that directly shape choices and charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lina's agency as she commits to resurrecting the terminal; the cost is legible in her physical strain and the emotional weight of uncovering grief, tightening the stake from survey to hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from patterns and flows, but the final line's explicit statement "hope is conserved when it is redirected" slightly moralizes, though it remains character-bound and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature blending engineer's precision and lyrical wonder; prose rhythm modulates with pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dense, vivid prose with no loops or artifacts; figurative language is controlled and purposeful, advancing story with high information density and clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of civil engineering, spaceport nostalgia, and existential hope; turns feel inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in quiet, technical resurrection that heightens stakes.</comment>
