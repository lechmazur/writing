<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Marek's weary stubbornness is embodied through concrete actions and micro-choices; his final endurance is earned with visible cost (ears bleeding, suit seams whispering), driving the narrative with no diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (library quiet, sea lighter) and felt cost; accumulative/textural lens holds tightly from package to proof; orientation is immediate and clear, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The underwater library is rendered with selective, pressure-driven detail; the lens and receiver constrain choice and charge the final image, integrating setting fully with stakes and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes (giving rest) escalate through Marek's agency under accumulative pressure; cost is legible in physical strain and the chased stillness halting, foreclosing paths with tangible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory and rest emerges from particulars (lens, library, distress signals) without moralizing; the final image of the cracked lens as proof offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV has a distinct perceptual signature (undertaker's lyricism); voice modulates with pressure but remains consistent, with no head-hopping or elision issues; rhythmic control heightens clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, advancing story and atmosphere; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; information density high, especially in peak beats, with no artifacts harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic undertaker with underwater library; tropes transformed through specific detail and emotional truth; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
