<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses (suspicion vs. need) are dramatized in scene; her final choice to trust is earned by the meteorite chip and Merek’s confession, with visible cost in the risk taken. Interiority is concrete and embodied (e.g., "bloomed and withered at once," practicing balance), and micro-choices under pressure reveal her hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a decisive change (trusting Oren and sending the pigeons) with felt cost (risk of betrayal) legible in the final image. Orientation is immediate, and the plot’s because/therefore linkages (chip, receipt, confession) narrow options credibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The attic setting constrains choice (beam, dust motes, floorboards) and charges the final image (“dust-lit air”). Sensory details are selective and purposeful (foxed paper, pigeon feed), filtered through Mara’s expertise, and integral to tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: Oren’s arrival with the chip and receipt tightens pressure, Merek’s confession deepens stakes, and Mara’s decision to send the pigeons carries a legible cost (risk and emotional shift).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (trust, preservation, reinvention vs. truth) emerges through particulars (paper trails, meteorite chip, dust motes); the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (“a small bloom”) that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct; Mara’s perceptual signature (noticing dust motes, balance) and lyrical, precise voice (“bloomed and withered”) modulate with pressure. Dialogue is natural and advances plot (Oren’s careful smile, Merek’s trembling).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density; sentences vary rhythmically, and there are no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, and the final line resonates without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh, organic synthesis of elements (pigeon trainer, dust-mote method, meteorite chip) feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet, internal climax heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity anchors emotional truth.</comment>
