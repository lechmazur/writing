<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and conflicted; micro-choices under pressure reveal values; final pruning action earned with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with felt cost (realization of own silence and pruning); causal lens holds tightly; orientation clear early; persistent constraints (compass, lace) shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (kelp, wet basalt, cerulean sky) filter through POV; micro-settings (compass, lace pattern, bonsai) constrain choices and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding unspoken apologies escalates via protagonist's agency; cost legible in anger diffused and self-realization; one meaningful tightening under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory and regret emerges through particulars (compass, lace, pruning); ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV with distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature selective and metaphorical; no head-hopping; diction and rhythm heighten pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language consistent and purposeful; no loops or artifacts muddying closure; sentence-level rhythm supports emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost ship compass and bonsai therapy transforms tropes; lyrical risk-taking pays off with inevitability; emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
