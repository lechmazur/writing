<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara's interior contradiction (obedience vs. rebellion) is concrete and embodied. Her final choice to build glass rooms is earned by the causality of her past guilt and the "verdict she carried," with cost legible in the memory of trapping her coworkers. The trait "thoughtfully spirited" is demonstrated in micro-choices (narrating, glassblowing) that balance consequence and wonder.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the station transforms from bunker to observatory, reconfiguring meaning with undeniable pressure. The causal lens holds: her return and actions are motivated by past trauma. Cost is visible in the final image of the "first stranger to enter and ask," foreclosing her isolation. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated and pressures choice: the thawing station "exhaled," cracked permafrost, and meltwater supply the reason for return and the resources (scavenged fuel cells). The control room and the glass panels function as micro-settings that constrain and enable her plan, charging the final image of the room reflecting stars.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (creating safe inquiry) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens: firing the kiln, shaping panels, and framing them constitutes a meaningful tightening that forecloses her former passivity. Cost is legible in the "seam" of the bookmark and the memory of silent coworkers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (thawing repression, safe inquiry) emerges through potent images (bookmark's question, glass panels) and action, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the quiet "felt like a door opening," and the observatory image reweights prior material without moralizing. The cracked bookmark as a "flaw" deepens the thematic complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt. Voice has a distinct perceptual signature—contemplative, precise, with a theatrical edge ("Behold, I remove the tarp"). Diction and syntax reflect her glassblower's attention to process and transformation. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., the committee's role) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and high information density ("the corridor tiles sighed with each drip"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance character and atmosphere simultaneously. The final paragraph's cadence shift ("the quiet felt like a door opening") lands the closure cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—glassblower, thawing station, safe zones for inquiry—is fresh, non-obvious, and feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric reflection, theatrical narration) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The concept is fully committed to and followed through with specific, grounded choices in character and setting.</comment>
