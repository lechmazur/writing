<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's characterization as a "creeping normality noticer" is concrete and drives her choices; her interiority is specific, and her final renunciation of the shard is earned with visible cost. The micro-choice of moving the clock tests her theory, revealing her values under pressure. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear causal chain under an accumulative lens, with a resonant closure that reconfigures the concept of home. The orris shard's persistent constraint shapes tactics, and the release carries a felt cost. Orientation is immediate; the mosaic of nights is taught and coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is rendered with selective sensory detail filtered through Mara's perception. The orris shard and the houses function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. The quiet bay and streetlights create a consistent atmosphere that pressures the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—what makes a house alive—escalates through Mara's agency, tested by moving the clock, and culminates in her releasing the shard with a clear cost. Under the accumulative lens, pressure tightens meaningfully via pattern and density increase.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Mara's actions and the recurring image of objects as words. The final realization that "a house lives when it can recognize itself" is earned and resonant without moralizing, offering a non-literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, poetic, and consistent in its close third-person POV. Rhythmic control and perceptual signature are maintained under pressure, with no head-hopping. The prose's lyricism is pattern-taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, varied syntax, and no scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, and sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of concepts (perfumery, object placement, attention) that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the core premise is transformed through specific, grounded detail.</comment>
