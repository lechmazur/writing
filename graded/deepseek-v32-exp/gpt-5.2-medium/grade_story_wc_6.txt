<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistently drives high-stakes choices; interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., going back into the fire, performing the graft) revealing a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation (leaving the coin) is earned by prior causality with visible cost, and contradictory impulses—fear of inheritance versus compassion—act simultaneously in scene. Hairline slip: minor thematic echo in "practiced unyielding compassion," but it is anchored in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly; closure is a decisive change (leaving the coin as a message) with legible cost (relinquishing protective charm, risking frame). Orientation is immediate; plot advances via because/therefore linkages, and the persistent constraint of the coin shapes tactics. No causality breaks; the copied coin reveal is set up by earlier mentions and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice (black sand used to judge wind, lagoon location forces hike) and charges the final image (black sand "absorb every story"). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through POV (firefighter's professional assessment). Spatial choreography is coherent; the obsidian lagoon and dunes function as micro-setting that alters tactics and resonates at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving scars can sing versus fear of legacy) escalates through protagonist agency: each choice (rescue, graft, coin investigation, final offering) narrows options and raises cost. Pressure coheres under causal lens; the final act of leaving the coin forecloses a path of hardening with visible cost. No coincidental resolution; tension operates at beat and story scale.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (coin, graft, black sand) without moralizing; subtext operates in gesture and image. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image of the coin left at the post, reweighting prior material. No thematic echo or summary; complexity is embraced through the protagonist's earned stance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (firefighter's alertness to smoke, wind, tremors). Voice is lyrical yet precise, modulating with emotional intensity. Dialogue is minimal but natural; psychic distance is controlled. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (e.g., transition to burn unit) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and rhythmic control; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences vary in length and structure, accelerating and breathing with scene needs. Word choice is specific and voice-motivated; grammar and punctuation are clean. Read-aloud ear test passes; closure image is sharp and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh (arsonist's daughter firefighter facing frame-up) and synthesized with specific, irreplaceable details (coin, black sand, field graft). Turns feel earned in hindsight; emotional specificity avoids generic templates. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the final reconfiguration is non-obvious and inevitable.</comment>
