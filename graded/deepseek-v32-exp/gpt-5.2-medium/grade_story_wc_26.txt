<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s sharp-eyed noticing and luminous regret are embodied through concrete micro-choices (rubbing the stone, investigating footage, offering her unshared dusk). Her final choice—giving the stone and true name—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: because dreams are damaged, Mara investigates; because she discovers the cause, she acts. Closure is a decisive change with on-page cost (stone and name given). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the river stone persistently shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Blooming Library is vividly rendered and actively pressures choices; the river stone functions as micro-setting, constraining Mara’s actions and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her dusk-noticer perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving hope) escalates through Mara’s agency: she moves from observation to investigation to transformative action. The tightening—realizing the shadow is a consequence of unanchored sharing—forces a costly trade-off (her stone and name), with cost legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the river stone, the shadow, and the footage comparison build to a resonant, non-literal answer about hope needing edges. The final statement (“hope has a shape”) is earned, though it verges on explicit; subtext remains strong in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptually signature voice (“sharp eyed dusk noticer,” “luminous regret”). Rhythm and diction modulate with pressure, and any elision (the shadow’s soundless speech) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and loop-free, with high information density and varied syntax. Figurative language (“like a garden turned inside out,” “smooth as a held breath”) is consistent and purposeful, never muddying clarity, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shareable dreams, a floating library, and a shadow born of unmoored longings feels inevitable in hindsight. The compassionate solution—anchoring with stones—transforms the premise through specific, grounded choices, avoiding template plots.</comment>
