<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with embodied emotions under pressure; final choice to follow the sea is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in leaving the dock. Captain Rusk's guarded heart opening through the scrimshaw adds relational depth. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a decisive change with on-page cost (apron left, sea claimed). Orientation is anchored early, and the plot advances via because/therefore linkages from scrimshaw to island detachment. Cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe and disappearing island are micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details like "barnacles bit" and "knee deep belt of green water" are selective and filtered through POV. Spatial choreography is clear during chain-detachment scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of freedom vs. safety escalates through protagonist's agency: using scrimshaw, persuading Rusk, detaching chains. Cost is visible in Rusk's weeping and protagonist's departure. One meaningful tightening under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of freedom and true nature emerges through particulars like the scrimshaw and island; subtext operates in gesture and image. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical yet grounded, e.g., "coil a hawser like a dancer." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in exchanges with Rusk.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "smiled like a man spared." No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes impossibility of violence, disappearing island, and heart-unlocking object into a fresh, organic whole. Transformation feels inevitable through character choices; risk-taking in lyric realism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
