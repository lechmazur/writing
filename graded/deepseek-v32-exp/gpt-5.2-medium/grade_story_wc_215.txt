<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion ("ash settled on my tongue like vows") and micro-choices under pressure. The final decision to read slips aloud is earned by prior causality—ghosts clustering, Mara's gesture—showing a meaningful change with visible cost in releasing the ghosts and accepting forgiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with legible cost as the oasis feels "like a place that could be tended again." Orientation is clear within ~120 words; the tangled covenant shapes tactics, and closure lands on-page with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with sensory details like "air smelled faintly of wax" and "cracked hives." The abandoned oasis and stained glass box constrain choices (dry spring prompts release) and charge the final image, integral to narrative logic and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from preserving unspoken words to releasing them, driven by protagonist's agency in reading slips aloud. Cost is legible in ghosts softening and departing, and Mara's forgiveness, under accumulative lens through density increase and cadence shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of release and forgiveness emerges through images and actions, not statement; subtext in gestures like Mara touching the hive. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Mara's slip and the oasis reconfiguration, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable, with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature ("read them through contextual clues"). Prose rhythm supports pressure, and elision (ghosts' silence) is taught and paid off in the closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops or scaffold; figurative language ("colors moved over their faces like slow speech") is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh, combining visible ghosts, beekeeping covenant, and stained glass box. Details are particular; emotional specificity avoids templates, and risk-taking in lyrical style pays off with a synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
