<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses (skepticism and kindness) are embodied and drive micro-choices under pressure, culminating in an earned stance change with visible cost—the mixing of aches. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The final choice to leave the squares is motivated by prior causality and carries felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orientation is clear within 120 words; causal linkages (“because/therefore”) tighten consistently. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (meaning revalued without miracles) with on-page cost in the line about letting other lives spill through. The inferred lens (Causal) holds, and the tile’s constraint shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through Mara’s POV and integral to pressure—the tower and tile constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (salt wind, whale breaches). The object-as-setting (tile) actively shapes the climax and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (skepticism vs. meaning) escalates through protagonist agency: Mara’s decision to transcribe, then to help Leena, tightens options and raises the cost of empathy. Escalation is driven by causal choices, and the cost is legible in the “mixing with your own” realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (grief, memory, meaning) emerges organically from concrete images and actions, without moralizing. Subtext operates through the tile, whales, and symphony motif. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the “quiet, unfinished symphony”—that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV (Mara) is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature that reflects her skeptical yet empathetic worldview. Voice modulates with emotional intensity; dialogue (sparse) is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. The final image (“quiet, unfinished symphony”) is charged and clear, with no artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of magic square, entangled memories, and whale migration feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded character choices. Risk-taking (quiet, reflective plot) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the premise commits fully to its implications.</comment>
