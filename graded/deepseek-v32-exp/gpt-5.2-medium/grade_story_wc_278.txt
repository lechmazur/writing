<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lio's guilt is embodied and contradictory, driving micro-choices that culminate in the decisive tethering; his final renunciation (guilt muted) is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the cooling amber and slackened tether.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost ("a guilt finally muted enough to live with") and the persistent constraint of the tattoo shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (studio, wardrobe, observatory) pressures choices; the tattoo as micro-setting constrains the climax; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, charging the final image with the meteor hush and cooled amber.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve guilt) escalates via Lio's agency; the fold and translation tighten options; cost is legible in the amber cooling and tether slackening, foreclosing the path of unaddressed guilt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of guilt and redemption emerges through concrete particulars (amber, firmware, tattoo); the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the muted guilt and new constellation, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature ("meteor hush," "silence between distant trains"); no head-hopping; elision (letters' origin) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmically varied, with high information density and no loops or scaffold; figurative language ("time had folded in on itself") is consistent and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of constellation tattooist, haunted firmware, and lost sounds feels organic and inevitable; risk-taking in surreal concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure image is uniquely charged.</comment>
