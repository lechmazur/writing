<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sava’s motivation is clear and particular, driving her to seek "the quiet in the storm" rather than mere safety; her competence and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., conjuring a "bloom of hush") reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final pact with the beings is earned by prior causality. A slight lack of contradictory internal impulses in scene keeps it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate and clear; closure is a decisive change (pact with the beings) with visible cost (the stone's use and Sava's ongoing role). The constraint of the harmonic caves shapes tactics, and the ending reconfigures the caves' state and the refugees' relationship to them.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, actively constraining choice and charging the final image; the harmonic caves, ice patterns, and Forge of Listening are woven into action with vivid, purposeful sensory detail. The environment shapes Sava's methods and the resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Sava’s agency under the causal lens, from tracking pressure to conjuring the bloom of hush; stakes are concrete (restoring quiet) and cost is legible in the use of the stone and the pact. The beings’ shift from threat to refugee adds deepening complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of harmony and refuge emerges organically through specific events and images; the "bloom of hush" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the conflict without moralizing. The final image of shared understanding lingers with meaningful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, rhythmic voice that reflects Sava’s perceptual signature ("hammered repose"); purposeful compression and elision are taught and paid off, and no head‑hopping or register drift disrupts clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and propulsive with high information density; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, no loops or scaffold obscure causality. Sentence‑level rhythm varies naturally, and the closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of harmonic caves, energy‑being refugees, and a mapkeeper’s sonic craft feels fresh and inevitable; risk‑taking in the quiet, negotiated resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry. The premise is fully committed and transformed through specific detail.</comment>
