<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and character-specific, with contradictory impulses (anger/gratitude) acting simultaneously. Final choice to use "measured light" is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the half-caught star and the father's confession. Emotions are embodied (e.g., "anger and gratitude mixed into something furiously tranquil, like rain that falls straight down"). Micro-choices under pressure (loading plates, stopping the timer at breath stutters) reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the poet reconceives censorship as "measured light," reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost ("every absence had a place and every hurt a latitude"). Cost is legible in the final image of carrying "plates like fragile oaths." Orientation is anchored early; pattern of ritual repetition is taught and pays off cleanly at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting (observatory, darkroom) is indispensable, constraining choice (timed exposures) and charging the final image ("descended into morning streets"). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and POV-filtered ("domes wet as black pearls," "thunder rolled under us"). Spatial choreography is coherent; the micro-setting (timer, plates) functions as a tool that shapes the entire narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding/naming scars) is signaled early and escalates via the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens. The ritual of timed exposures deepens pressure, narrowing options to a final reconfiguration. Cost is unmistakable in the "wound that refused to close" image and the father's confession. One meaningful tightening (the revelation about the father) forces a trade-off and alters tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete images and actions (timer stopping mid-bloom, star map with crosses). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of censorship and scars through the final atlas image. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication (the sealed envelope, the masks slipping). No moralizing; complexity is embraced without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent perceptual signature ("storm-kissed wonder"). Prose rhythm is controlled and modulates with pressure. Purposeful compression (the condensed father revelation) is taught and pays off. No head-hopping; diction remains within the poet's plausible lexicon, even at peak intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly purposeful, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and enhances clarity ("a wound that refused to close"). Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with the ritual's rhythm. Information density is high; every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Synthesis of censorship, astronomy, and photography is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept ("vigil in pause") is transformed through grounded, character-driven choices. Risk-taking in the accumulative, ritualistic structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth and specificity avoid any template feel.</comment>
