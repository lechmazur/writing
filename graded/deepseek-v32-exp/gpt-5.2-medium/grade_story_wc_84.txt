<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara's sharp-eyed observation and the pilgrim's quest are concretely embodied; micro-choices under pressure (drone launch, masonry pull) reveal hierarchy of values. The final alignment feels earned, though internal contradiction is subtle rather than deep.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; orientation is immediate; closure is a conceptual repricing (belonging as aligned pieces) with legible cost in Mara's surprise and pilgrim's laugh. The missing-pieces constraint shapes every tactic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Observatory at dusk is vivid and constraining: the slit, dome, and hidden passage dictate Mara's drone flight and discovery. Sensory detail (soot-dark lenses, smell of old oil) charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (decoding belonging) escalate through Mara's agency: drone mapping reveals gap, pulling masonry opens passage, fitting chips triggers realization. Cost is felt in the reconfiguration of "missing pieces."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of belonging through alignment emerges from concrete particulars (matrix chips, star trails, frequency tone). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV (Mara) has a distinct perceptual signature—drone pilot's eye for grooves and trails—with poetic, controlled diction. No head-hopping; voice remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without loops or scaffold; figurative language ("brilliant dimness," "shy comet") is purposeful and clear. Every sentence advances story, atmosphere, or character.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone tech, ancient observatory, and type foundry chips transforms the quest for belonging into a specific, inevitable pattern. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
