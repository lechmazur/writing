<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara’s characterization is precise and driven by her core contradiction as a “con artist’s honest child.” Her internal conflict (ledger-keeping vs. her father’s cons) compels micro-choices like hiding the ink and writing the real affidavit, culminating in an earned, costly breach. Ivo and Sami apply immediate, distinct pressure. Minor deduction: Sami’s interiority remains somewhat schematic, but this doesn’t undermine Mara’s arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive lens is clear and held. Closure is a decisive change (Mara’s successful defiance reconfigures her relationship with Ivo) with felt cost in Ivo’s diminished presence and her final calculation. Orientation is immediate; plot linkages are tight and motivated. The ink’s established property pays off cleanly in the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices (the unclaimed body, the hidden ink) and charges the final image. Sensory details (disinfectant, roses, drain gurgle) are selective, vivid, and filtered through Mara’s professional POV. Spatial choreography and object handling are coherent and consequential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Sami’s asylum/Mara’s moral reckoning) is signaled early and escalates meaningfully under the causal lens with the agents’ arrival. Mara’s agency—using the ink to present truth—drives the resolution, foreclosing her father’s path at a visible relational cost. Pressure tightens cleanly in a single, consequential turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Themes of truth, fairness, and moral calculus emerge organically from particulars (the ledger, the ink, the unclaimed body). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in Mara’s final line and the image of the ink pot beside the folded hands. Subtext is rich in gesture and object, avoiding statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mara’s perceptual signature (“the drain gurgle like a throat clearing itself”). Voice is distinct, lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates with pressure. No head-hopping; dialogue is sparse but goal-driven and character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished, dense, and propulsive. Sentences are varied and rhythmic, doing multiple jobs without padding. Figurative language is precise and purposeful (“pulse beat loud enough to animate the silence”). Zero artifacts, loops, or register drift. Closure image is delivered with clarity and charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of a con-artist family drama, magical-realist ink, political asylum, and funeral-home labor feels fresh and inevitable. Specific, grounded details (the toe tag, the torn passport) create authenticity. The quiet, conceptual climax is a bold risk that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
