<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lani’s characterization is concrete and nuanced, with embodied emotion (rubbing the coral fragment) and micro-choices under pressure that reveal a clear hierarchy of values. Her final action—grafting new meaning onto old wounds—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Mako’s shrewd innocence is a poignant, if minor, accent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Clear causal lens with immediate orientation; the closure is a Conceptual Repricing (grafting meaning onto wounds) that reweights the premise of translation and conflict. Cost is legible in the fear-swollen ink and loaded rifles, and the cause-effect chain tightens decisively through Lani’s agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly selective (mist-clad atrium, gray‑coin lilies) and, more crucially, the brain coral fragment and the cast function as micro‑settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through Lani’s professional perception, weaving atmosphere into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preventing violent misunderstanding) is signaled early and escalates through Lani’s active decryption of the cast. Her agency drives a meaningful tightening: the notes reveal a mourning meeting, not an ambush, forcing a trade‑off that averts violence with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars (smudged notes, coral fragment, false‑friend word) without moralizing. The final image offers a resonant, non‑literal answer to healing and translation, reweighting prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical yet controlled perceptual signature (“water lilies into gray coins”). Voice remains consistent under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., the actual dialogue is reported) serves the accumulative texture without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic but maintains clarity and propulsion; no loops or scaffold artifacts. Sentence rhythm varies naturally with the scene’s tension. The slight ornate risk (“lotus‑hearted ache”) is voice‑motivated and does not muddle peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh, non‑obvious synthesis of translation, trauma, and ceasefire mediation feels inevitable in hindsight. The specific use of a child’s cast as a diplomatic document transforms a familiar trope through grounded detail and bold lyrical risk that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
