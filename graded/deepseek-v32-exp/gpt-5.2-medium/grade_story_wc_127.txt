<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's contradictory impulses—professional detachment versus genuine empathy—are dramatized in scene; her final choice to subsume her own shame is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in Orin's transformation and her boundary-setting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with decisive emotional change for Orin and resonant reconfiguration for Mira; causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages; cost is legible in earned tears and the payment as boundary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The amber grotto and blotter petal are not merely vivid backdrops but constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details are filtered through Mira's professional POV, integrating seamlessly with action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens; her decision to offer bitter courage rather than absolution tightens stakes and leads to a cost-unmistakable transformation in Orin.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of authenticity versus counterfeit emerges through concrete actions and images; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Mira's insight about "training wheels for something real," without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—Mira's voice blends professional detachment with poetic sensitivity; rhythmic control under pressure and taught elision (static electricity) pay off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and clear, accelerating momentum toward the peak beat where clarity is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise of a counterfeit emotion dealer is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis; specific details like static electricity sensing and amber transformation heighten stakes and feel inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that enhances coherence.</comment>
