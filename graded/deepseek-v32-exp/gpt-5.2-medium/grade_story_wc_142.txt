<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ira's dual allegiance is embodied through concrete micro-choices (graffiti tags, feeding Council truths) and internal contradiction ("hope rise and panic chase it"). Her final confrontation with Vell arises from established causality, and her exhausted mural carries visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: privatization threat → stone chip → graffiti coordination → confrontation → moratorium. Closure is a decisive change with legible cost (exhaustion, desperate hope) and the persistent constraint of the raft seams shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The raft city is vividly specific and actively constrains choice—its floating, rearrangeable nature enables the climax. The foundation stone chip, charged with etched seams, directly pressures the final image and Ira's plan.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes (community autonomy vs. privatization) escalate via Ira's agency: from secret warnings to orchestrating reorganization. The cost is felt in her desperation and the risky, exhausting culmination; one meaningful tightening forces Vell's choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of fluidity vs. fixation emerges through action (retying rafts, coded graffiti) and the final mural's non-literal answer: "stay free by staying fluid." No moralizing; subtext in gestures like the stone chip's map.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited to Ira is stable; voice has a distinct, lyrical texture ("perpetual carnival stitched from pontoons") that reflects her orderly intuition. Dialogue is spare but goal-driven (Vell confrontation), and perceptual signature is consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without artifacts; sentences advance character and pressure ("desperation sharpened her hope into a plan"). Figurative language is controlled, and closure image is clear with no muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gentrification, raft-city mechanics, and graffiti-as-resistance feels inevitable. The concept is fully committed, with specific details (foundation stone chip, carnival codes) transforming tropes through grounded stakes.</comment>
