<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Haru's motivation to collect time's textures is concrete and drives every beat; his studious precision and incandescent restraint are embodied in micro-choices (charting hums, placing gilded paper). The final stance—carrying cataloged sensations—is earned by prior accumulation, with cost felt in his acceptance of silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds cleanly; orientation is immediate. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the final image of carrying "cataloged sensations" reweights silence from loss to a scorable pause, with cost legible in Haru's endured labor and transformed attention.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through Haru's stationer sensibility; the bonsai labyrinth charges the final image by providing "rougher grains" of time and the oak's lightning scar reconfigured silence as a "pause waiting to be scored."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving time's textures) tighten via accumulative density: movement from indoor hum to garden's mixed-sound refraction deepens agency. Cost is visible in Haru's effort and the final trade-off—he carries sensations, not predictions, foreclosing easy hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through specific, resonant images (gold leaf, hum lines, bonsai) without statement; the ending answers the central question of meaning in silence through a non-literal, charged image of cataloged sensations that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, precise, and studious, mirroring Haru's vocation. Voice modulates seamlessly from shop to garden, maintaining rhythmic control and purposeful elision that pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with no loops or scaffold. Sentences vary rhythmically, and figurative language ("minutes had prisms") is consistent and clarifying. Information density is high, each line advancing character or atmosphere without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of stationer craft, post-apocalyptic silence, and invented histories feels inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; the integration of elements is organic and singular.</comment>
