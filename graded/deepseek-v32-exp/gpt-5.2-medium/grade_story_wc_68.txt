<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orin's interior contradiction (dread vs. longing) and micro-choices under pressure earn the final renunciation; cost is legible when he rejects the meal ticket and builds the teaching rig in the damp dark.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a charged poise (building the rig) with on-page cost ("one measured tooth at a time"); orientation is clear by ~120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (silt layers dictate digging method) and charges the final image (damp dark sewer); sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, e.g., "stank of old paper and salt."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Orin's agency under causal lens: digging, retrieval, rejection, teaching; cost is visible in forfeited meal ticket and continued isolation; stakes tighten meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of competing narratives emerges through particulars (silt layers named for lies, cog as anchor); ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice distinct ("abrasive calm," sanding wood metaphor); POV stable and perceptual signature sharp; dialogue minimal but natural; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose dense and vivid with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language consistent ("sea coughing bodies"); rhythm varies naturally; no artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic philosophy and specific object (cog); risk-taking in voice and concept heightens stakes; feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
