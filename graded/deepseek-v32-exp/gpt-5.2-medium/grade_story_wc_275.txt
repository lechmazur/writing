<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maris is vividly drawn, with clear motivation and a quiet strength that drives the plot. Tarek's transformation from hunter to helper is earned through tactile interactions with the talisman and the roses. However, Maris's internal contradictions are underplayed; she remains steadfast without visible struggle, which slightly limits emotional depth. Still, the characterization is strong and serves the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The plot is taut and causal, with each beat advancing the stakes. Closure is a decisive change: Tarek abandons his bounty to plant seeds, a shift legible and earned by prior actions. The orientation is immediate, and the causal lens holds without ambiguity. Cost is felt in Tarek's relinquishment of his rifle and role.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glass-domed rose farm is not just backdrop but a crucible that constrains choices and charges the ending. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Maris's perceptive attention. The roses' trained behavior directly influences the climax, making the setting indispensable to the narrative logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the outset: will Maris protect Lio and her vision of continuity? Escalation is driven by the approaching militia and Maris's calculated actions to disarm her father. The cost of Tarek's conversion is visible in his knelt posture and subsequent advocacy. Agency rests firmly with Maris, and the pressure tightens credibly to the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete images: the engraved talisman, the roses that refuse to open for violence, the planting of seeds. Subtext operates through gesture and silence, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how to build continuity, leaving a lingering emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV stays tightly anchored to Maris, with controlled dips into Tarek's perception via free indirect style. The voice is lyrical yet precise, with a distinct perceptual signature. Sentence rhythm modulates with tension, and any elision serves the pattern of quietness that pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic without becoming muddy; each sentence advances character, setting, or conflict. Figurative language ("like dark snow," "tranquil blaze") is consistent and enhances clarity. There are no synonym loops or scaffold sentences; the line-level craft supports momentum and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar elements into a fresh, specific vision through the original concept of value-incultated plants. The risk of a quiet, cultivation-based resolution pays off, feeling inevitable in hindsight. The integration of all elements feels organic, not checklist-driven, and the emotional truth is precise.</comment>
