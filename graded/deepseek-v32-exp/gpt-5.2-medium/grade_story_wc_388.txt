<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the investigation with professional determination. Interiority is concrete ("my hands go cold") and micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values (truth over safety). However, the character lacks contradictory impulses in scene, and emotional progression is somewhat flat, which prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with cost: mailing the ledger risks Ministry retaliation while ensuring truth spreads. The causal lens holds tightly from inciting incident through discovery to final action. Orientation is immediate, and the plot's because/therefore linkage is flawless, culminating in the resonant "Stillpoint of fact" image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choice (respirator, dust storms) and charging the final image (apples as tangible truth). Sensory details (sky tasting like pennies, grit circling the orchard) are vivid and purposeful, filtered through the narrator's observational POV. The Stillpoint orchard is both a physical discovery and a thematic anchor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: reassembling letters, journeying to the Stillpoint, confronting the supervisor, and mailing the ledger. The dominant stake (uncovering truth) tightens with each beat, and cost is legible in the risk of disappearance and the Ministry's pursuit. The final action forecloses a path with visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: the diamond as both curse and beacon, the Stillpoint as metaphor for truth amid lies. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of mailing evidence to rival bureaus, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a debunker's analytical voice and rhythmic control ("sentences reappeared like bones under sand"). Dialogue is minimal but natural, carrying subtext. The perceptual signature is consistent, and purposeful compression (e.g., journey summary) maintains momentum without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and varied syntax. Figurative language is effective and coherent, avoiding muddle. There are no loops, scaffold, or register drift; sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere with concision. The final paragraph lands with rhythmic precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes familiar tropes (conspiracy theorist, post-apocalyptic wasteland) into a fresh, non-obvious whole. The diamond-as-detector and Stillpoint orchard are organically integrated, and the final twist (mailing to rival bureaus) feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
