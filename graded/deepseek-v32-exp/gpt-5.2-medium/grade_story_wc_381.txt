<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and drives the story; her dilemma (erase vs. warn) is presented though the internal conflict is summarized rather than fully dramatized in scene. The final choice is earned and carries visible cost, but the emotional layering is efficient rather than deeply contradictory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single-scene causal lens holds; orientation is immediate. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (she bears the warning alone). The prophecy and crane's wing constrain tactics, and the ending reconfigures stakes without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is integral, not decorative: the brook delivers the prophecy, the stone anchors the ritual, and the "terrestrially cosmic" stones ground the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filters through Liora's urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silencing the prophecy) escalates through Liora's agency: the prophecy resists, she faces a dilemma, and chooses a third path that tightens options and exacts a cost (carrying the burden to speak plainly).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (code vs. plain speech, burden of knowledge) emerges through action and image, not statement. The ending—brook flowing in "simple syllables," Liora resolved to speak plainly—offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and distinct; lyrical, rhythmic prose reflects Liora's perceptual signature. No head-hopping; elision (the prophecy's content) is taught and paid off in the filter choice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dense, poetic prose maintains high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and legible; no artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar elements (prophecy, summoner) via specific, irreplaceable concepts (smoothed hush, origami wing). The third-path resolution feels inevitable in hindsight; lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
