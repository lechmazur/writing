<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is concrete and motive rooted in her trait of methodical curiosity; her guarded kindness shifting to openness under pressure is embodied and earns the final choice. The final renunciation of sealing the chapel in favor of an archive is a decisive change with visible cost in her reframing of the map and the softened whispers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds cleanly from inciting incident to closure; orientation is immediate; closure is a decisive change (chapel reopened, shadow stilled) with felt cost in the reframed map and the new purpose. The map’s tear and the shadow act as persistent constraints that shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid, selective, and POV-filtered; the rain-scoured fresco vault and the ancient henge constrain choice and charge the final image (rain like applause). Sensory detail is purposeful and integrated with action, heightening the theme of erosion and recovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (interpreting silence, giving voice to erased lives) escalates through Lena’s agency; each investigative beat tightens options. The final choice to reframe the map and reopen the chapel forecloses the path of sealing and carries a visible cost in the reconfigured archive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence, erasure, and empathetic witness emerges through concrete particulars (torn map, shadow, box of maps). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; the chapel’s whispers soften into “permission,” reweighting prior material through image and action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt; voice has a distinct perceptual signature (map-framer’s attention to edges and silence). Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping; elision (the shadow’s meaning) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and propulsive without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is precise and consistent; sentence rhythm varies naturally with the beat. Information density is high, and the final image lands with clarity and charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of maps, silence, and erased lives feels inevitable; the whispered chapel concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. Risk-taking in structure (video comparison, reframed map) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
