<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bellhop's interiority is concrete and contradictory (duty vs. compassion), culminating in the micro-choice to whisper "C"—a hierarchy of values earned by prior causality with visible cost (the "REMAIN" order). His emotional progression under pressure is credible, and the final stance of "choosing a quiet that protected without erasing" is a resonant Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly from inciting incident (Edda's question) through discovery (hidden surveillance) to closure. The Charged Poise ending—whispering, the "REMAIN" alert, and the crystallized choice to protect—lands on-page with undeniable conceptual and emotional cost ("a frostbitten hope"). Orientation is immediate and pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The "cobalt fortress" is a pressure chamber that constrains every choice. The piano bench bolt evolves from a missing object to a key tool and finally a handle for hiding, actively charging the climax. Sensory detail ("oil and old varnish," "humming pipes") is filtered through the POV's urgent, professional attention.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safety vs. humanity) escalates cleanly under the causal lens: the bellhop's agency (discovering the hidden system, stealing the bolt, whispering) forces a trade-off with palpable cost. The final tightening—the "REMAIN" order and approaching footsteps—narrows options to a protective, costly poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept's implications: silence as surveillance, protection, and erasure. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in "a quiet that protected without erasing, a frostbitten hope," reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and withheld speech.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by professional observation ("the slightest discoloration, a thumbprint of darker dust"). Lyrical compression ("like a white palm") is voice-motivated and legible. The whisper beat masterfully controls psychic distance and rhythm under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propelled, with high information density and zero loops or scaffolding. Figurative language ("muting the world," "bolt glinting like a tiny star") is precise and integrated. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates through the discovery and climax without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a silent hospital, hidden surveillance, and a pianist's nerve regeneration is fresh and specific. The core premise is fully committed to, with implications followed to a non-obvious, quiet climax. Risk-taking in the lyric, charged poise ending heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
