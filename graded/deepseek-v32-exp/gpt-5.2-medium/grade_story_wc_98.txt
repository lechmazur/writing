<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tavo's interior contradiction (empirical doubt vs. measured pattern) drives the scene; his final choice to plant the seed and surrender certainty is earned by the dream interpretation and prior causality, with visible cost in "felt it leave him like a surrendered certainty."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the tree anchors memory against the monsoon, cost legible in Tavo's surrendered certainty and the community's chorus. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting (ridge, monsoon, crevice) pressures choice and charges the final image; sensory details (salt air, warm stone, cool mist) are selective, POV-filtered, and integral to the ritual's logic and outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving collective memory) tightens through Tavo's agency under the accumulative lens; his dream interpretation and planting escalate pressure, with cost unmistakable in his surrendered certainty and the tree's fragile growth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (memory as collective, tidal imagination vs. empirical proof) emerges through concrete particulars; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the tree of voices, avoiding moralizing and reweighting prior doubt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, empirically whimsical voice, consistent psychic distance, and rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping, and all elision (dream fragments) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with high information density and purposeful figurative language; no loops, scaffold, or register drift; sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the ritual and climaxes in the tree's growth.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fantasy reality checker, dream-based memory, and empirical whimsy feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative, lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure recharges all elements.</comment>
