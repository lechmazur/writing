<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lio’s motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, with interiority shown through embodied memory and micro-choices (weighing, polishing). His change—from guilt to purpose—is earned by on-page actions, and the final vow shift feels inevitable with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (fear vs. duty) act within the polishing beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: because of his vow, Lio seeks the grotto, finds the glass, polishes it, and transforms the village. Orientation is immediate, closure is a decisive change (vow shifts from punishment to purpose) with felt cost in the final weighing and teaching. No causality breaks; the persistent constraint of “no fire” shapes every tactic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (serpentine grotto, mist, tide pools) and pressures choice by supplying the sea glass. The grotto and the glass function as micro-settings that constrain and enable Lio’s actions, charging the final image of the pearl. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through his star-watcher perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (share light without fire) is signaled early and escalates through Lio’s agency: finding, weighing, polishing the glass. One meaningful tightening occurs when he breathes his apology into the pearl, confronting his fear. Cost is legible in the vow’s transformation and the village’s softened grief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (light without burning, stillness as healing) emerges organically from concrete images and actions. The final pearl offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like weighing guilt and polishing memories into intention.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, star-watcher perceptual signature. Voice remains consistent under pressure, modulating naturally from reflection to action. Minimal dialogue is natural and character-specific; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmically varied, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (“nights like sealed ink,” “zephyr bloom”). Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs; no artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of star-watching, trauma, and sea-glass alchemy feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and process. Risk-taking in quiet, lyrical resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
