<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Nara and protagonist are deeply characterized; motives rooted in past trauma and telepathic trait drive plot with embodied emotion. Final choice to unseal embryo earned through prior causality, cost visible in Nara's surprise and salamander's rebirth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure lands with decisive change from oracle to salamander, cost legible in Nara's laugh and Rebuilder role. Orientation anchored early, persistent constraint of imprinting shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Volcanic hot springs constrain unsealing and charge final image; sensory details like steam and ground hum are woven into action, with plants and rock micro-settings directly shaping choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of evolving tradition escalates through decoding and unsealing; agency driven by Nara and protagonist leads to trade-off where embryo imprints on story, cost unmistakable in transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of chosen destiny emerges through particulars—crystal, amber, salamander—without statement; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer in Rebuilder and kites as collective decoding.</comment>
