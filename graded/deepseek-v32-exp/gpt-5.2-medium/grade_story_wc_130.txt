<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lysa's interiority is concrete and contradictory ("tenderly furious"), and her final renunciation—accepting Orren's reachable but not retrievable state—is earned through prior micro-choices (adjusting the eyes, offering the lullaby) with visible cost. The attribute "gently inventive" is embodied in her spellwork, and her motivation drives every beat without diagnostic labeling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens held throughout; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with legible cost ("reachable, though not retrievable"). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the mosaic pattern taught early pays off in the sequence and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is essential, constraining choice (stalactite drops mark time, mosaic stone guides method) and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Lysa's perception, with no static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation occurs via density increase (pattern recognition, sequence counting) and a cadence shift that opens the seam. Lysa's agency (whispering conjuration, building the bridge) drives the tightening, and the cost is unmistakable on the page in the theorem she accepts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of ambiguous loss and the mathematics of emotion emerges through concrete images (glass eyes, mosaic, ladder bridge) and culminates in a resonant, non-literal answer: "love can continue without resolution." No moralizing; subtext operates in gesture and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical yet precise, blending conjuration and mathematical diction. Voice remains consistent under pressure; purposeful compression (e.g., "a third state, like a number between integers") is taught and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and propulsive with high information density. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; rhythm varies naturally. The final image ("carrying buried optimism like a lantern under her coat") lands with clarity and charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of conjuration, mathematical emotion, and cavern mythology feels organic and inevitable. The quiet, conceptual ending transforms the trope of loss through specific, grounded choices and risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
