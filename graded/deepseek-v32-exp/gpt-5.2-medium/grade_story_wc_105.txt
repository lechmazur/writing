<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in synesthesia and grief; interior contradiction is shown in her prickling response to Rell. Her final choice to report him is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the weight of "two truths." No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied through specific perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate with who, where, when anchored in first lines. Closure is a decisive change—the click reveals betrayal—with cost legible in "feeling how its tiny weight now carried two truths." Plot linkages are because/therefore without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices: the greenhouse protects, the forge processes memory-laden metal. The environment charges the final image of apple blossoms and melted brass, reweighting theme. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding truth) escalates through Mara's agency: the prototype imprints silence, forcing Rell's confession. Cost is unmistakable in his whispered admission and her realization about memories. One meaningful tightening under causal lens forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory as rot or forge emerges through particulars—collecting absences, the click, apple blossoms. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext operates in silences and the final image of growth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct with synesthetic perception ("Aurora spilled green and bruise purple"). POV is stable third-person limited to Mara; diction and rhythm reflect her mind under pressure. No head-hopping; dialogue is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without loops or scaffold; figurative language is controlled ("auroras green go thin"). Information density is high, advancing story and atmosphere. No overwriting or register drift in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise is highly original—synthesizing synesthesia, memory engineering, and maritime grief into a specific, inevitable arc. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices in character and setting; emotional truth is particular, not generic.</comment>
