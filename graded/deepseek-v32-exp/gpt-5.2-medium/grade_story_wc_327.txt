<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ilen's motivation to preserve Vey is clear and intensifies under pressure, with micro-choices like using bird patterns to control the diamond. Interiority is concrete through action and perception, though internal conflict is subtle. The final choice is earned by prior causality with visible cost (Toma's death, diamond's hunger).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost: the diamond sated, language preserved in canyon echoes. Accumulative/Textural lens holds tightly; orientation anchors early. Persistent constraints (canyon, diamond) shape tactics, and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting (canyon, bone towers, tunnel) constrains choices and charges the final image, acting as a throat for the dying language. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Ilen's POV. Micro-setting (diamond, bird patterns) alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving Vey) escalates under Accumulative lens via density increase: diamond's hunger threatens, bird patterns provide control, Toma's death forces adaptation. Agency drives escalation, with cost legible on-page (curse sated, effort).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of language preservation through texture and sound emerges organically from events, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via canyon echoes reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Ilen, with distinct perceptual signature focused on sound and texture. Voice is lyrical and consistent, rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., bird patterns) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with high information density and varied rhythm. No paraphrase loops, template cadence, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of dying language, cursed diamond, echo harness, and bird patterns feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details are irreplaceable.</comment>
