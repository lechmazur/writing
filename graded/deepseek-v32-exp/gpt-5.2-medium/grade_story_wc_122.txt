<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mara's deafness and teaching background are concretely embodied; her micro-choices under pressure, from sensing the filament to scoring the record, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal linkage tight: muted drums summon Mara, her investigation leads to backward play, snapping the hush. Closure lands with felt cost as the Listener sighs and drums thrum cleanly, lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cavern and phonograph constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory detail selective (drip and echo, vibrations under boots) filtered through Mara's deaf perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes (emotional numbness) escalate through Mara's agency; her decision to score the record while reversing it drives the climax with legible cost (Listener enthralled, hush destroyed).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence shaped into feeling emerges from particulars; ending reweights prior material without moralizing, via "play the song backward... until hearts remember forward."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV stable in Mara's limited third; perceptual signature distinct through vibration and silence; prose rhythm varies with pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose dense and propelled; sentences do multiple jobs (e.g., "filament of hush tugged at the grooves"); no loops or scaffold; figurative language consistent and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deaf perception, parasitic silence, and backward song; concept fully integrated with character and conflict, risking lyrical abstraction but grounding in tactile detail.</comment>
