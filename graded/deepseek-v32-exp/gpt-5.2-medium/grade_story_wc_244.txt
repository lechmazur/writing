<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's loneliness and Mara's desperately jocular facade are embodied through micro-choices; the final shift to shared silence is earned by on-page reciprocal acts, with visible cost in passing the rock.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from rumor to rock rule to closure; orientation is immediate; closure lands with on-page cost as the rock cools and silence feels shared, reconfiguring stakes through reciprocity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and constrains choice—the disused station's neutrality enables meeting, the baggage room houses the rock; ivy and tickets charge the final image of polite anarchy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cure for loneliness) escalates via protagonist's agency in kindness exchanges; cost is legible when the rock cools and is passed on, foreclosing isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocity emerges through concrete acts, not statement; subtext in Mara as first patient deepens; final image of shared silence offers resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; Mara's dialogue carries subtext; voice modulates lyrically under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with figurative language that heightens pressure ("grin bright but hungry"); no loops or scaffold; clarity and propulsion sustain to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of disaster relief, moon rock, and reciprocity feels inevitable; risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without gimmickry; transformation through specific detail.</comment>
