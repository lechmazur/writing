<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and her steadfast persistence is embodied through micro-choices, but the absence of contradictory impulses or internal conflict limits the characterization from reaching the highest tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate; closure lands with a decisive change and visible cost (blood rinsed at sunrise), and the "truce of hush" persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
