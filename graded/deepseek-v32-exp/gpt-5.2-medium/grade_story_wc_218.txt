<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is clear and consistent, with her "brazen calm" and systematic approach embodied in her actions and diary. Her motivation to foster interspecies respect drives the plot, and her final gathering is earned by prior causality. However, interior contradiction is underplayed; her calm is steadfast, missing the contradictory impulses that could heighten complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens held: closure is a resonant reconfiguration (earned stasis/charged poise) as Mara's work continues beyond her death. The cost is legible in her aching work and final lying down. Structure is tight, with discovery, action, and gathering all leading to a reweighted ending where the orchard "kept translating."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is integral and vividly specific, constraining choice and charging the final image. The living stone pillars, channels, and orchard are woven into action and discovery. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, reflecting Mara's expertise and the island's ecology.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (interspecies respect before death) escalate through Mara's agency: discovery, remodeling, and gathering. Pressure tightens via physical decline and monk resistance. Cost is visible in her aching work and the final scene, though the monks' conversion is somewhat swift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of distributed belonging emerges through particulars (channels, copper wire, seed pods) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the orchard's ongoing translation. Subtext operates in image and implication, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Mara's perceptive, botanical lens. Voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with rhythmic prose that mirrors the island's pace. No head-hopping; dialogue, though minimal, is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense, vivid, and precise, with strong imagery and varied syntax. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere efficiently, and the final paragraph lands with resonant clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of ecological observation, architectural mystery, and mortal urgency. The premise is transformed through specific, lived detail and a non-obvious moral calculus. Risk-taking in accumulative structure and lyrical voice heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
