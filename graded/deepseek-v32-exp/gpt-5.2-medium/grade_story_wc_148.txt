<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to "chase hush" is concrete and intensifies under pressure; interiority is embodied in micro-choices like hovering and listening. Final renunciation—whispering the warning but not touching the bodies—is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("the hush would belong to them, not me"). Contradictory impulses (truth vs. silence) act in scene without diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a Charged Poise with legible cost in the final image of waiting for the shout. Orientation is clear within 120 words (lighthouse prison, cry-wolf boy). The lattice as persistent constraint shapes tactics and the final reconfiguration, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (lighthouse prison, labyrinthine wing) constrains choice and charges the final image via the Fresnel lens. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through POV. Micro-setting (lattice, scuffed door) functions as "setting" that alters tactics and outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chasing hush) escalates through protagonist's agency using the lattice and hovering, tightening options. Cost is unmistakable in the renunciation of spectacle and the transfer of hush. Under accumulative lens, density increase reweights stakes with felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (silence vs. truth, legacy of lies) emerges from particulars like the lattice and lens without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of hush belonging to the dead. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, resisting tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature; voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping. Purposeful elision (e.g., "hover, not by magic but by listening") is taught and pays off at closure. Rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with varied rhythm; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Information density is high (e.g., "lattice gave each sound a place to go"). Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and closure image is sharp without artifact interference.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of the "boy who cried wolf" myth through specific lived detail (lattice, hush) feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passed: story would break if elements were swapped.</comment>
