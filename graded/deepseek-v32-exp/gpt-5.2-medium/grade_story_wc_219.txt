<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies under pressure; final choice (theft) earned by prior causality with visible cost—lab dyes making narrator "easier to read" and decision to "report a different chemistry" forecloses passive observation. Interiority concrete and character-particular ("a biochemist who refused to kneel to either myth or management"). Minor deduction for slight telling of motivation early, but micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on page as Decisive Change with felt cost: taking the shard and deciding to report "a different chemistry" reconfigures stance from assigned observer to active subversive. Causal lens holds tightly via because/therefore linkages (vial → crystals → door → pedestal). Orientation clear within 120 words; persistent constraint (council's plan) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges final image: tower, sculpture path, and bronze door guide discovery; microcrystals and fly amber are objects-as-setting that directly enable and constrain the protagonist's actions. Sensory detail selective and purposeful, filtered through scientific POV (meter readings, microcrystals). Spatial choreography coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under causal lens: unfiltered listening, examining footprints, cracking vial, taking shard each narrow options and raise cost. Dominant stake (understanding vs. reporting) tightens meaningfully; final trade-off (theft from the script) carries visible cost. No coincidence or off-stage resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: homecoming as "measurable convergence of volatile molecules" reweights prior material without moralizing. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via image of stolen shard and "different chemistry." Subtext in council's manipulation and protagonist's rebellion avoids explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV stable with distinct perceptual signature: scientific lexicon and lyrical precision ("bronze quiet") blend seamlessly. Voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping. Unfiltered receiver elision taught and paid off. Dialogue minimal but natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language consistent and purposeful ("stones shone like cooled bronze"). Syntax accelerates with discoveries. No artifacts that obscure causality or dull closure; final image sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of first contact and biochemical homecoming feels inevitable in hindsight. Specific, non-obvious angle (tower as catalyst sampling scent and sweat) transforms trope through grounded character choices. Risk-taking in lyrical scientific diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
