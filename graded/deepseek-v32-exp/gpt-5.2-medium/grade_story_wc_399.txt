<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Iri's characterization is precise: her "strangely honest" honesty, peripheral awareness, and motive to preserve wisdom without ownership are concretely embodied. Her final bargain with the prophet arises from her reading of his restraint, a micro-choice earned by prior causality. The prophet's trembling fingers provide a physical anchor for his internal conflict. A hairline slip: his desire to "tune his voice" is slightly abstract, but his on-page behavior and emotional release (weeping) ground it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building pressure through imagery and thematic resonance toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands on-page with cost: the clearing collapses, the parapet settles, and Iri's realization about "honesty" and "secrecy" reconfigures the stakes. Orientation is clear within 120 words. The lens holds without contradiction; the final image makes the conceptual cost of balanced preservation undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("kettle steam," "grinding pulse"). The kinetic parapet functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image—its alignment "like ribs under skin" is pivotal. The pavilion and dunes are filtered through Iri's professional awareness. Spatial choreography during the ritual is coherent and tactile. The environment is indispensable to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving wisdom without ownership) is signaled early. Escalation under the accumulative lens is a single meaningful deepening: the parapet's twitching prompts Iri's risky bargain. The cost is legible in the prophet's quiet weeping and the physical risk of the ritual. Agency is clear—Iri initiates the bargain, and both characters' actions narrow options and reveal shared motive. No coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of silence, balance, and the stewardship of wisdom emerge organically from concrete events (the ritual, the prophet's words, the parapet's response). Subtext operates in gesture (the prophet's trembling fingers, Iri's uncovered eye). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Iri's realization—"her honesty had chosen the right kind of secrecy"—reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV (Iri) is stable and apt. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture with controlled rhythmic variation. Perceptual signature is strong—filtered through Iri's peripheral awareness and professional discipline. Diction remains within her plausible lexicon; psychic distance is consistent. The experimental compression ("whisperfield calm") is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and no scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language ("paced the pavilion ropes like a thought," "align under the sand like ribs under skin") is coherent and enhances clarity. Sentence-level propulsion varies effectively with scene needs. Read-aloud rhythm is smooth; no line-level artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements (kinetic parapet, line walker, conjured clearings) is fresh, non-obvious, and feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded world logic and character choices. The lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The story commits fully to its premise and follows implications to a coherent, charged closure.</comment>
