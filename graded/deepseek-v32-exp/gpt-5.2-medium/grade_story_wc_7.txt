<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is concrete and consistent; her ability to taste memories drives micro-choices (pruning for specific memories) and her final act of shaping the canopy is earned by prior causality. Minor deduction for a slight diagnostic label in "informally wise," but interior contradiction is shown through her selective pruning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly; closure is a decisive change (the fruit's consumption and the garden's creation) with visible cost (the risk of patrols and the careful pruning). Orientation is immediate; the persistent constraint of the Ministry shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice (broken glass as skylights, space for the tree) and charges the final image of the "luminous garden." Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's culinary perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency: planting, pruning, and serving the fruit. The dominant stake (gentle rebellion) tightens through the celestial alignment deadline. Cost is legible in the pruning choices and the patrol lights outside.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars; the final image of the "open canopy" as "the safest form of defiance" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of memory and rebellion, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature rooted in taste and culinary metaphor. Rhythm is controlled, and purposeful elision (e.g., the botanist's last meal) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful. A single hairline slip: "synaptic plasticity" is a slightly technical term that briefly jars the POV's lexicon, but clarity and propulsion remain intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of memory-tasting, knowledge fruit, and gentle rebellion in a dystopian setting is fresh and specific. The concept is fully committed to and transformed through grounded, character-driven choices, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
