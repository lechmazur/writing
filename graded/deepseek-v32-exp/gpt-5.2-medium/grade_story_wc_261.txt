<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as a closure seeker who opens wounds is concrete and drives every choice; internal conflict is embodied (satisfaction/dread, reopening the wound) and the final release is earned with visible cost. No stock phrasing or diagnostic label-speak; her telepathy with plants is integrated as a trait that enables causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages; closure lands with decisive change (neighborhood exhales, scar becomes legible) and felt cost (wound leaks warmth). Orientation is clear within 120 words; the displaced miracle setup pays off at closure without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (tower, cellar, rooftop) and micro-settings (wound, coffee rings, hourglass) constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("meteor hush," "roots that pulse like veins"), woven through action without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (meaning vs. smoothness) escalates through Mara's agency under causal lens; cost is unmistakable (reopened wound, pain) and the release tightens options. One meaningful turning point (discovery of displaced miracle) reweights stakes with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (closure as return, scars as stories) emerges through concrete images and events without moralizing; ending offers resonant non‑literal answer (wound becomes legible script, light branches). Subtext operates through plant whispers and guilt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is consistent (professional coffee‑ring diagnosis, chlorophyll syllables). Rhythm controls pressure; no head‑hopping. The rosemary’s speech fits the magical‑realist tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence‑level propulsion varies with scene needs; closure image is clear and charged. Read‑aloud rhythm is polished.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of scar reading, plant telepathy, and displaced miracle feels organic and inevitable; risk‑taking in quiet magical realism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth is specific, not template‑driven.</comment>
