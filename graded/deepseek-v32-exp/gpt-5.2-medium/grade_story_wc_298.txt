<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is concrete and compelling; her "fiercely gentle" nature is embodied in actions like bandaging a thief and, crucially, her final choice to bind fates and sacrifice her ability to forget pain. This choice is earned by prior causality and reveals a clear hierarchy of values with on-page cost. Internal conflict is shown through the flare of "old loss" steadied by "dusky resolve." A minor deduction for the slightly diagnostic "something leaked through him" regarding Jory, but the core arc is flawlessly motivated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly: Mira's goal (mend the trade) leads to discovery (tampered thread) and a decisive, costly resolution (new bargain). Closure is a clear Decisive Change with felt cost ("yesterdays hurt fresh as dawn"). Orientation is immediate and vivid. The persistent constraint of the orchard's rules and the silver thread shape tactics and the final, locking image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is indispensable, a micro-setting that actively constrains choice (roots as runes guide her path) and charges the final image (skull apples stop clacking). Sensory detail is selective, damp, and tactile, fully filtered through Mira's interpretive perception. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment evolves with the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Jory's wholeness) is signaled early and escalates meaningfully under the causal lens: the discovery that the thread has been harvested forces a higher-stakes choice. Mira's agency drives the escalation, culminating in a trade-off with a visible, lasting cost. The pressure tightens cleanly from problem to complication to costly resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of sacrifice, memory, and the cost of care are woven seamlessly through concrete particulars—the burned card, the silver thread, the "seams she could live with." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to mend a soul, embracing complexity without moralizing. The final image reweights prior material with quiet power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and deeply embedded, with a distinct perceptual signature ("reading the angle of roots as runes"). Prose texture is lyrical yet precise, and syntax modulates effectively with pressure. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven and carries subtext. No head-hopping or register drift; voice is cohesive and compelling.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("skulls like pale apples," "smile thin as onion skin") is consistent and purposeful. No loops, scaffolding, or metaphorical muddle. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating and pausing in step with the beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a destiny-bartering economy within a bone-and-root orchard is fresh and fully committed. The core concept shapes every beat and is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character (Mira's gentle resolve) and moral calculus (refusing to steal a stranger's destiny). The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight, a mark of high originality.</comment>
