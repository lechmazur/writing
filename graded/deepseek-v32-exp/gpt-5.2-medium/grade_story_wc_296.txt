<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thalen's motivation ("to discover what mirrors don't show") is clear and drives consistent, escalating choices. Interiority is concrete and embodied ("warlike serenity," "cold seized my lungs"), and his trait as "Finder" is integral to the plot. The final choice to use the seed and sing the war-chant reveals his values and is earned. Slight deduction for a lack of deep internal contradiction or complex emotional layering under peak stress, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from inciting incident (failed trick) through methodical investigation to decisive closure. Orientation is immediate. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the lake releases lost things, the orchard stops, and the conjurer speaks, with cost legible in "the dark water behind it, honest at last." The persistent constraint of the circles and the mirror-lid shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. The swirling orchard vortex, ice coffin, and mirror shards are micro-settings that pressure the protagonist's actions. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("air smelled of apples that never ripened," "branches circling in disciplined fury"). Spatial choreography is clear and integrated with the plot's causal logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Thalen's agency under the causal lens: rowing to the vortex, descending, confronting the twin, and strategically using the seed. Each choice narrows options and raises cost. The dominant stake (unfreezing the truth to break the curse) is signaled early and paid off with a visible price—the thawing twin and the released "tide of lost things." Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus reflection, and the danger of wanting to be seen without being known, is intricately woven through concrete events and images (mirrors as bait, the frozen twin, the plant's hunger). Subtext operates in implication. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in the final image of the "dark water" behind the shard, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, druidic voice that modulates under pressure ("warlike serenity," "calm as a drawn blade"). The prose has a rhythmic, incantatory quality fitting the tone. No head-hopping. The perceptual signature is strong and consistent, with purposeful compression in high-stakes beats ("I pushed my pouch-seed into the mirror cage... sang the druid war-chant in a calm voice").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. Figurative language ("laughter turned to ash," "disciplined fury") is precise and cohesive. No loops, scaffold, or register drift that obscures closure. The final image lands with clarity. Minor, voice-motivated stylistic repetitions ("warlike serenity") do not harm momentum or sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of concepts (frozen confession, truth-eating plant, vortex of drowned trees) feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (druid, cursed lake) are transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic. The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on vanity and reflection. Risk-taking in the lyrical, conceptual approach heightens stakes and coheres perfectly.</comment>
