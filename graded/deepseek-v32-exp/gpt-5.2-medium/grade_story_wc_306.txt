<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interior contradiction ("sincerely insincere") and embodied micro-choices under pressure earn her final renunciation; the cost of her paid conscience feeling like her own is legible without diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from client request to cloak decision; closure lands as a Charged Poise with cost in "her paid conscience felt briefly like her own," and orientation is clear within the first sentence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (wind chimes dictate entry) and charges the final image (cloak woven of gray threads); sensory details like "salt and old oil" are filtered through Mara's professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens—mirror shard and chimes narrow options until she chooses to wear the cloak; cost is visible in her altered relationship with her role.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the hollow mirror and cloak without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via "promise to keep questioning."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., deciphering chimes "the way other people read letters"); voice modulation under pressure avoids head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold; figurative language (e.g., "cloak of doubt... breathed back as questions") remains coherent and serves closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of "conscience for hire" and metaphorical objects feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical abstraction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the premise is fully committed.</comment>
