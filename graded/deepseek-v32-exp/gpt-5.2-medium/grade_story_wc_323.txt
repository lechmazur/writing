<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's "balancedly curious" nature is consistently embodied and drives her micro-choices, culminating in an earned reconfiguration of her teaching mission. Interiority is concrete, but internal conflict remains subtle rather than deeply contradictory, which limits the highest band. The final choice is motivated by prior causality with visible cost ("grief and wonder braided together").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from curiosity to ascent to curriculum rewrite. Closure is a decisive change (Mara's realization and application of "unfolded horizons") with on-page cost felt at the surface. Orientation is immediate and clear; the chain link constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressure-laden: the benthic city necessitates navigation by sonar, while the surface ascent becomes a pivotal resource. The boat anchor chain link functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through Mara's professional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learning starlight navigation to prepare for alien contact) escalates through Mara's agency: developing edge geometry, requesting the ascent, testing it. Cost is legible in the surface scene's "grief and wonder." One meaningful tightening (the successful fix of position) forecloses reliance on old methods.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events: "unfolded horizons" and "edge geometry" become non-literal answers to secrecy and limitation. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing, offering a resonant concept of expanded responsibility. Subtext operates through imagery (chain link, petal arcs).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Mara's perceptual signature—professional, precise, with a poetic yet grounded rhythm. Voice modulation under pressure is controlled (e.g., the ascent scene). No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("biolamps glowed like deep stars") is consistent and clarity-preserving. Rhythm supports momentum, and the final line lands with thematic charge without artifice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of underwater civilization, alien contact, and navigational geometry feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity in details (chain link, edge geometry) transforms familiar tropes. Risk-taking in conceptual premise heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
