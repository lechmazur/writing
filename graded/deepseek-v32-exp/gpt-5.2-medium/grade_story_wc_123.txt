<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's meticulous nature and curiosity drive credible choices under pressure; interiority concrete via storm-honed calm; final shift from solitary to shared integrity earned through causality, with sister's on-page presence adding relational crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain from follower to message to lateral investigation lands closure with decisive change (escape, recorded truth) and cost legible in unlatched gate misdirection and written promise; orientation clear within 120 words, lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices: courtyard's hush enables pigeon arrival, quarantine gap permits entry; recurring notebook and pigeon tube charge final image; sensory detail selective (barometer ticking, chlorine smell) and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes of integrity vs. state fraud escalate via protagonist's lateral agency; cost visible in raw wrists, risk, and emotional reconfiguration; one meaningful tightening (discovering cover-up) forecloses option of bureau compliance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of integrity in solitude emerges through storm-recorder lens; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via "solitude would remain a choice, not a cage," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (barometer ticks, wind shifts); voice matches professional observer; dialogue minimal but functional (sister's whisper); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dense, purposeful prose without loops or scaffold; figurative language ("like a wet match") serves atmosphere; sentence rhythm varies with pressure; information density high, closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of storm recording and quarantine cover-up; lateral progression method feels inevitable; specificity in details (ration paper, fever cultures) avoids template; emotional truth anchors risk.</comment>
