<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist is vividly characterized through concrete interiority and micro-choices, with a clear, consistent motive driving the plot. However, the lack of contradictory impulses or genuine struggle undercuts depth, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly; closure is a decisive change (successful silent revolution) with clear conceptual cost (empty Cradle of Sparks). Orientation is immediate, and the plot's linkage is tight, though the resolution faces minimal opposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is richly specific and integral, with the fort, sundial, and quill holder actively constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through the sentinel's professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silent revolution) is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency under the causal lens; cost is legible. However, the absence of significant opposition or tactical complication limits the pressure's visceral impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of quiet subversion emerges organically from action and image, culminating in a resonant, non-literal final image. Subtext operates through gesture and implication without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is exceptionally stable, with a distinct, poetic perceptual signature. Voice modulates naturally with pressure, and syntactic control is precise, supporting the story's rhythmic momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, vivid, and flawlessly propelled, with high information density and no artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and clear, and sentence-level rhythm expertly matches the scene's tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a lock sentinel, coded sundial, and stolen sparks for a silent revolution is original and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the quiet, subversive closure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
