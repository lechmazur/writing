<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Celeste's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with embodied emotion; her final choice to intervene rather than expose is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a decisive change with felt cost (observatory preserved, truth without spectacle); causal lens holds tightly with orientation anchored early and persistent constraints shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly selective and purpose-driven, with the observatory and rosewood nib constraining choices and charging the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Celeste's agency under the causal lens, tightening through proof by contradiction to a bargained resolution with unmistakable cost on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("No planet, but plenty of truth") without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm control heighten pressure without head-hopping, and dialogue carries subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmically varied, with high information density and no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of truth-seeking and regret feels inevitable; specific details like the rosewood nib and observatory setting heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
