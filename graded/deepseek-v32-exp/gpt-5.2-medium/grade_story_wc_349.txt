<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in their erased past, intensifying under the parole task. Interiority is concrete and embodied (hands shaking from recognition, counting absences). The final choice to step toward the beginning is earned by prior causality—the incising reveals their own story. Relationship with Mira serves as a crucible, applying pressure. Minor deduction for interiority occasionally leaning toward poetic abstraction rather than raw contradiction, but the closure choice carries visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of metaphorical pattern (absence, fragmentation) builds until a cadence shift at recognition. Closure is a decisive change (self-liberation) with felt cost in the vendor's realization and the address left behind. Orientation is clear within 120 words (vendor, glass library, opening day). Structure is a single continuous scene with one smooth transition; the ending reconfigures the premise effectively without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and indispensable: the glass orchard library pressures choices (drifting shelves, table over open sky) and charges the final image (root address). Sensory details are selective and purposeful (cloud vortices, pale pulse of moonlight). Micro-settings (cart, bottle, reading table) function as tools that constrain action. Environment meaningfully shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding one's beginning) is signaled early and escalates through the parole task. Under the accumulative lens, pressure tightens via the methodical counting of absences, leading to a cadence shift at the incising moment. Agency is clear: the vendor actively measures and carves, triggering self-revelation. Cost is legible in the trembling fragments and the vendor's decision to leave, foreclosing their prior blankness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Themes of erasure, second starts, and self-authorship emerge organically from concrete actions (selling blanks, incising absence). Subtext operates through images (bottled moonlight as witness, hollow title). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the story begins with a cart wheel on glass, implying cyclical creation. No moralizing; the core concept of "glimmering parole" integrates fully with character arc and closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and intimate, with a distinct perceptual signature (noticing patterns, absences, cloud vortices). Voice is lyrical yet precise, modulating under pressure (counting sequence becomes focused). Diction remains within character lexicon. Purposeful elision (wiped past) is paid off at closure. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but functional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and varied syntax. Figurative language is consistent and enhances clarity ("speech broken into photons" serves the mystical tone). No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Rhythm accelerates appropriately during the counting and incising beats. Minor risk of overwriting in one metaphor, but it is pattern-taught and does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar elements (floating library, amnesiac protagonist) into a fresh, specific vision. The concept of measuring absence to incise beginnings is non-obvious and fully committed. Voice and setting are memorable and cohesive. Bold risk-taking in poetic density heightens stakes without gimmickry. The ending reconfigures the premise with inevitable hindsight.</comment>
