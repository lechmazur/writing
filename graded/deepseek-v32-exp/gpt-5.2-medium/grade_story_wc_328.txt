<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's professional bitterness and undercover role drive micro-choices; Jonas's embodied conflict peaks in his offer to make bitterness the punchline. Final arrowhead planting is earned by prior causality with visible cost in his ordinary, sweating state after the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a decisive change with Jonas saved but reconfigured, cost legible in "crouched beside the arrowhead, sweating and ordinary." Arrowhead as persistent constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Underground garden and flint arrowhead function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory details like "iron, honey, and the old grief" are selective and filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of keeping Jonas human escalates via confessions to garden climax; agency of Mara and Edda drives one meaningful tightening, with cost unmistakable in the gravity hiccup and Jonas's transformation halted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of bitterness turned into cosmic joke emerges from events; ending offers resonant non-literal answer—"jokes are how you refuse to disappear"—without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature as a cryptid researcher; voice is lyrical yet controlled, dialogue natural and goal-driven, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density; no loops or scaffolds; figurative language like "gravity had learned to smile" supports mood without muddle, and rhythm accelerates with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cryptid research with metaphysical concepts like the Pulling Choir; specific details feel inevitable, and risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
