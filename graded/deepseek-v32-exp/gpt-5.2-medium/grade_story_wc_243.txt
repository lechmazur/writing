<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara's interior contradiction (euphoria/haunt) acts in scene, and her final choice to tear the page and insert everyday losses is earned by prior causality with visible cost—the mayor's shaken signature, the dropped locket. Her motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, embodied in specific actions like steeping parchment and reading aloud.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: discovery of locket → realization of cover-up → rewritten covenant → public confession. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (covenant reweighted to small moments) with felt cost on-page (shaking hand, torn page). Orientation anchors early; no disorientation or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (jetty, archives) pressures choices and charges the final image—locket dropped into water, sea smells of walnuts and wet paper. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; the jetty as micro-setting constrains tactics and resurfaces at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honest history vs. sanitized covenant) escalates through Mara's agency: she forces confession, altering the covenant's terms. Cost is legible in the mayor's public shaking and the torn page. One meaningful tightening under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars—walnut ink, locket, small moments—without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: covenant's power from everyday losses. Subtext in imagery; no thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature (archivist's lyrical, thorough voice). Diction and rhythm control heighten pressure; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density, varied rhythm, zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language consistent and purposeful; no muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion advances story cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archivist, sea covenant, and locket discovery feels inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet, introspective plot heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific lived detail transforms tropes.</comment>
