<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Yara's characterization is vivid, with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure; her final sacrifice of voice is earned and costly, though her determination is slightly one-note.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal linkages are tight; closure lands with a decisive change (Jun's return, her muteness) and felt cost on the page; the inferred causal lens holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and integral—the orchard and loom constrain choices and charge the final image, though the orchard's atmospheric role slightly outweighs its tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through Yara's agency; the cost of her voice is unmistakable and reweights the ending, satisfying the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through image and action; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer about sacrifice and connection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature that heightens emotional pressure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or artifacts; figurative language is controlled and advances the story.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story synthesizes elements with originality; the concept of weaving silence feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
