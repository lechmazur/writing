<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation as a coral bleaching witness grounds her investigative drive and final acceptance of secrecy; interior contradiction between measuring and mourning is embodied in concrete details like "trying not to smell the reef." Her micro-choice to encode the beacon schedule in tapped rhythms is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in her complicity with hidden protection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: each beat—monthly attempts, chart assembly, fog‑bound meeting—narrows options toward the delayed revelation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost: Mara’s decision to hide the schedule in taps reconfigures her role from measurer to active guardian, captured in the final image of “drifting moored.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the floating station, tide‑governed canal, and recovering reef constrain every choice. Sensory selection reflects Mara’s expertise (“slap of water under the deck,” “pale bones freckling with new color”), and the environment directly pressures tactics (beacon schedule, skiff navigation) and charges the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering why paths disappear) escalates through Mara’s agency—monthly skiff trips, chart assembly, fog‑journey—culminating in the hooded woman’s revelation. The cost is legible on‑page: she forfeits transparency to protect the reef, rewriting reports and encoding secrets, a trade‑off that tightens options under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical restraint emerges through particulars: atlas palimpsest, timed tides, tapping rhythms. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer—Mara becomes part of the “periodically eternal” cycle—without moralizing; subtext operates in gesture and silence (the envelope, the tapped codes).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third‑person limited POV filtered through Mara’s scientific‑mournful perception; voice is distinct and rhythmic (“drifting in its leash like a patient animal”). Tapping motif is taught early and pays off at closure; no head‑hopping, and dialogue (hooded woman) is spare but goal‑driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without artifact: sentences vary rhythmically, figurative language is precise (“the reef she used to dive when it turned white”), and information density is high (each line advances character or atmosphere). No loops, scaffold, or register drift; closure image lands with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of climate‑change witness, cartographic mystery, and secret ecological stewardship feels organic and inevitable. The “time‑slice” route and tapping‑code method are fresh inflections that heighten stakes; specificity (tide turbines, atlas pages, beacon schedules) anchors universals without gimmickry.</comment>
