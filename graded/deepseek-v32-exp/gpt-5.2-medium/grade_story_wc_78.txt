<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Leeward’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving every tactical choice under pressure. His interiority is concrete and embodied (e.g., holding the mallet “like a talisman,” reading clouds), and his micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values. The crew’s conversion from skepticism to participation is a credible relationship shift under pressure, though Leeward’s internal contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: each beat flows from Leeward’s agency (tapping, sketching, climbing) and produces consequential reactions (crew coordination, freighter’s course change). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—the repaired mallet and the insight that “prophecy needed harmony” crystallize the story’s rule-set. Orientation is immediate and vivid, and the two-shard structure (crisis then aftermath) is seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The driftwood orchard is indispensable, constraining every choice and supplying the instruments for survival. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (“salt pears,” “wet deck”), filtered through Leeward’s professional perception. The setting evolves causally (storm, drift) and charges the final image of the repaired mallet under pear leaves. Micro-setting (mallet, buoy) actively shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survival) is signaled early and escalates coherently under the causal lens: drifting toward freighters → storm → hunger. Each tightening is driven by Leeward’s agency, forcing trade-offs (e.g., using the spar as a beater). Cost is legible on the page (thudding fruit, threatened tree, spent storm). The crew’s adoption of the method after the crisis is an earned deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from action: turning obstacles into instruments is enacted, not stated. The final image (mallet repair, reflection on translation) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates in gesture and image (e.g., fractal spirals aligning with currents). Slight explicit articulation in the closing line (“prophecy needed harmony”) is earned by prior dramatization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and deeply filtered through Leeward’s perceptual signature (clouds as “written notes,” sound mapping). Voice is distinct, lyrical, and rhythmically controlled, modulating with urgency. No head-hopping. Purposeful compression (e.g., “Days later”) is legible and serves causal momentum. Dialogue is minimal but functional where present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid with high information density, advancing story and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (“sea held the day in its throat”). Rhythm varies naturally with scene pressure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sentence-level propulsion is excellent, especially in the storm sequence. A hairline slip: “restless euphony” is slightly ornamental but does not muddle clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is strikingly original (orchard afloat, tide prophet, sketched resonance) and fully committed. The synthesis of music, navigation, and survival feels organic and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in voice and setting heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth emerges from specific, lived detail (scarred mallet, tar repair). No template or derivative echoes.</comment>
