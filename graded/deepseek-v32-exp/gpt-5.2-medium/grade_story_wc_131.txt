<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lio's contradictory impulses—wanting visibility while remaining hidden—are embodied in micro-choices like caching help and watching through vents; his final feeling of being seen is earned by causal actions aiding the child, with cost in continued endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from child's cry to tape find to note and closure; orientation anchored immediately; closure lands on-page with decisive internal change and felt cost of endurance ("did not step out, not yet").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Library setting and ferromagnetic tape fragment actively constrain Lio's choices and charge the final image; sensory details (copper smell, burnt dust) are selective and filtered through POV, elevating atmosphere beyond backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (visibility) escalates through Lio's agency in response to the child's fear; cost is legible in his continued hiding versus emotional reward, tightening under causal linkages.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of visibility through memory emerges implicitly from events; ending offers resonant non-literal answer via tape warmth reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Close third-person POV stable with distinct lyrical voice driven by sense memory; perceptual signature consistent; minimal dialogue natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is densely poetic yet clear, with varied rhythm and high information density; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle even in peak beats like the tape fragment reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hidden-helper trope with sense memory concept; specific details (pipe chases, ferromagnetic tape) feel indispensable and emotionally grounded.</comment>
