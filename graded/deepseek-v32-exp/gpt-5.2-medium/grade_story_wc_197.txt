<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's underestimated rebel persona is clear and consistent; her resourcefulness drives key choices with embodied emotion, though internal contradiction is subtle, and her final action is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal linkages tighten from courier's failure to plate theft; closure is a decisive change with cost (sirens converging), orientation early, lens holds, but switchboard info slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting vivid and functional—auric lagoon and phone booth key constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details selective and woven into action, though capped due to Q2 gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes of resisting erasure escalate via Mara's agency; pressure coheres from missing courier to ledger reveal to plate swap, with legible cost in converging sirens under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs. indifference emerges through images (booth, lagoon) and action; subtext resonant, ending offers non-literal answer without moralizing, capped due to Q2.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature (puddle reflections, gold code); voice consistent and purposefully poetic, no head-hopping, dialogue minimal but natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose dense and rhythmic, sentences varied, figurative language controlled ("nails holding a painting"); no loops or scaffold, but minor register elevation in peak beats, capped due to Q2.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of revised histories, phone booth key, and auric lagoon feels inevitable; tropes transformed through specific detail and emotional truth, capped due to Q2.</comment>
