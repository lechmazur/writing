<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in archival expertise; micro-choices under pressure (scattering seeds, aligning breath) reveal hierarchy of values. Interiority is concrete though depth is constrained by length; final choice to speak combinations aloud is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure lands with decisive change (combinations copied and shared) and cost legible in "mist reclaimed its secrets." Orientation is immediate; spiral path and seeds as keys shape tactics, but cost is slightly indirect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail (water dripping upward, slick stone) pressures choices; grotto as archive constrains tactics and charges final image. POV filter through Ilya's profession integrates setting with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding combinations) escalates via causal linkages: gravity inversion, spiral path, door puzzle. Protagonist agency drives each turn; cost is visible in memory recovery and risk, tightening options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory and sharing emerges through particulars (seeds, grotto archive, spoken combinations). Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext in "a combination that is shared resists being stolen by silence."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature ("prism-minded," "water dripped upward"). Voice is consistently lyrical and professional, filtered through Ilya's expertise; no head-hopping or dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language ("shadow slid ahead") is purposeful and clear; sentence propulsion varies naturally with scene pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of archival mystery with surreal elements (gravity inversion, luminous ink) feels inevitable; risk-taking in world-building heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details resist swappability.</comment>
