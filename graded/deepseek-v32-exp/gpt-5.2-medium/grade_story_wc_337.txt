<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete and embodied; final choice to break the family vow is earned by prior causality with visible cost; micro-choices under stress reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (hush thins, spirits grounded, mask breathes); causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate; the late reveal of the ancestor is earned and transforms tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting (prism sanctuary, quartz staircase, salt mirrors) and tool (tapestry needle) constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated with action and pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grounding spirits) escalates through protagonist's agency in unraveling knots; cost is legible in breaking the vow and confronting the ancestor; one meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (vows of fear vs. freedom, silence as prison or choice) emerges through concrete images and actions; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct; voice is poetic and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature; rhythmic modulation supports pressure; no head-hopping or distance issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; syntax and rhythm vary purposefully; line-level craft is flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mythic elements feels organic and inevitable; specific details (interlaced hush, net, needle) are irreplaceable; bold lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
