<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to learn the language of old buildings is clear and drives action; Ilyas is consistently rendered as patient and nimble, their relationship evolves organically. However, interior contradiction is subtle, and the final choice, while earned, lacks deep contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages; closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change (building saved, Ilyas fades) with felt cost in Ilyas's departure. Orientation is immediate, and no plot breaks harm causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (rooftop garden, meteor shower) is vividly sensory and selective; the seal and parapet stones constrain choices and charge the final image. Micro-setting functions as environment that pressures tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving the building) escalates under causal lens via protagonist agency—interrogating Ilyas, using the seal, planting documents. Cost is legible in Ilyas fading and risk of failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (language, preservation, agreed-upon lies) emerges through particulars like the seal and Ilyas's teachings; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer with Ilyas fading "like a word finally understood."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature; voice modulates with pressure (e.g., "meteors stitched white seams"). Dialogue natural for Ilyas, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story cleanly, e.g., "the wax looked like fresh mortar, every groove shining."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of dead language tutor, magical realism, and building preservation feels inevitable; risk-taking in blending mundane and mystical heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
