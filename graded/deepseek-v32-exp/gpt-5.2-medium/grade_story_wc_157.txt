<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation clear and intensifies; Lio is archetypal but functional. Internal conflict shown but not deeply explored; final participation earned with cost felt in raid.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal chain strong; closure lands with Conceptual Repricing (garden messages root) and cost legible in raid scattering; orientation early and lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse as micro-setting constrains choices (humidity fogging lenses) and charges final image; sensory details selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes clear (protecting thought); escalation from refuge to raid driven by protagonist's agency; cost visible in audit and chaos.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through patterns and gardens; ending resonant but slightly explicit ("no one taxed rain"); subtext in gestures and silences.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct scientific voice; dialogue minimal but natural; perceptual signature consistent; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose dense and lyrical with good rhythm; minor overwriting ("candidly cryptic" repeated); no major artifacts; closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise fresh (thought tax, insect-based resistance); details specific and organic; synthesis feels inevitable; risk-taking heightens stakes.</comment>
