<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and consistent, driving choices like questioning assumptions and proposing the raw archive. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions (e.g., Mara's posture loosening). The final choice to "propel the lens toward honesty" is earned by prior causality, showing cost in the raw archive's inclusion of anger and silence. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the raw archive's "anger at the council, gratitude for neighbors, and silence where names were missing." Orientation anchors who, where, when early. Accumulative/Textural lens held throughout, building through sound details to the final reconfiguration of connection. No causality breaks; persistent constraint of the lens shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific ("velvet baffles and copper throats") and constrains choices: the lab and miner's lens enable sound refraction central to the plot. The lens charges the final image in the chamber with "golden shadows." Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through POV, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (authentic connection vs. scripted comfort) is signaled early and escalates under the Accumulative lens through agency: Mara's fear of hollowness leads to collaboration, and the press walk forces a choice. Cost is unmistakable in the raw archive's exposure and officials answering questions. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, like the lens focusing sound, without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "connection has texture and requires care," reweighting prior material through the pilgrimage's transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: poetic, sound-focused narration ("prism-song bell ringer"). Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and dialogue (e.g., Mara's snort) feels natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet clear, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere. Example: "My bells are not metal but glass prisms, and each strike breaks silence into colors." Grammar and punctuation are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-crisis recovery, sound, and authenticity feels inevitable. Specific details (prism bells, lens) transform tropes through grounded choices. Risk-taking in mosaic structure and thematic depth heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
