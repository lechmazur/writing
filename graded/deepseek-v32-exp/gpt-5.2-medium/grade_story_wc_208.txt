<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete and her motivation—curiosity turning to purposeful action—drives the plot; her “perpetually learning” trait is demonstrated through on-page micro-choices that alter tactics. The final choice to create sculptures is earned by prior causality, though the emotional cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (town uniting, sea wall repaired) with conceptual cost; causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages; orientation is immediate and the archway’s magic is taught early, paying off in the timewoven alliance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice—the archway shelters Mara and houses the lantern; the storm pressures action; sensory details (rust, kelp, turbine-hum) are filtered through her POV and charge the final image of two gatherings in shared light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sea wall failure) is signaled early; pressure escalates under a causal lens as Mara learns from the projection and acts, narrowing options. Agency is clear, though the cost is more implied than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of trust across time emerges through concrete actions and images (spiral sculptures, lantern slide) without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the aligned spirals and the two gatherings in shared light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and voice is distinct—lyrical, precise (“turbine-hum reverie,” “storm-tossed archway”); perceptual signature is consistent; dialogue (projected) is minimal but functional; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of loops or scaffolding; figurative language is controlled and purposeful; sentence-level propulsion matches scene urgency; closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of magic realism, ecological stakes, and craft-based communication feels organic and inevitable; the timewoven alliance concept is transformed through specific, grounded details and a bold structural risk that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
