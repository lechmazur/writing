<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied, with her insomnia and poetic nature driving her choices under pressure. The final act of tearing the postcard is earned by her role and longing, with visible cost in its destruction and her emotional investment. The "shyly unstoppable" trait is somewhat told but supported by decisive action, and her contradictory impulse—wanting an answer from Iren yet apologizing for it—adds depth without diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (lilies bloom, anger softens) with felt cost on the page (postcard destroyed, Mara's shaken fingers). Causal lens holds tightly: blackened lilies prompt elders' request, map discovery, descent, and ritual success. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of the postcard and singing shapes tactics. Slight convenience in the map's timing is offset by prior integration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell and Heart-Cistern constrain Mara's path and choices, while the galaxy postcard charges the final image. Sensory detail ("tides rubbed its ribs," "pool the color of old pearls") is selective and filtered through Mara's poetic perception, deepening atmosphere without stalling momentum. Setting is indispensable to the story's logic and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (renew armistice to prevent war) escalates through Mara's agency: she descends, sings, and sacrifices the postcard. Cost is legible in the torn card and her emotional risk. Pressure tightens meaningfully under the causal lens, though the escalation is straightforward without major reversal, slightly limiting peak tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme (peace watered with memory, pain transformed into beauty) emerges organically through the lilies' metabolism and Mara's writing, avoiding moralizing. The ending's message is revealed through taste and image, offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Slight explicit statement in Iren's message is earned by prior particulars and not in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, poetic voice consistent throughout. Perception is filtered through Mara's specific idiom (e.g., "reef-shadow joy," "unspent years"). No head-hopping; rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity. Purposeful elision (e.g., Iren's backstory) is anchored in the present and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density, zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, avoiding muddle. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, propelling the story. No line-level artifacts obscure causality or closure; even peak beats maintain clarity and specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a shell city, blossom armistice, and galaxy postcard feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise is fully committed to its implications. Specificity anchors emotional truth, avoiding template plots or derivative echoes.</comment>
