<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lysa's interiority is concrete and conflicted, with embodied emotion driving micro-choices; her final stance shift from carrier to agent is earned by prior causality with cost visible in the risk from conspirators below.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from discovery to action; closure is a charged poise with cost legible in "oddly calm" realization; orientation is immediate and diary triggers clear because/therefore chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through Lysa's perception; icebound spire and goggles constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes of agency escalate through her active decoding and decision to stop the elevator; cost is felt in the danger below and her emotional shift, driven by protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of joy beneath anguish emerges through diary entries and Lysa's action; final image reweights without moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer via "sabotage as well as salvation."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical yet precise, modulating with emotional intensity without head-hopping; elision (e.g., light reflection) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is controlled and serves clarity, with peak beats free of muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable; light-reflection decoding and trust-based plot are fresh risks that heighten stakes without obscuring clarity; transformation of discovery trope is specific.</comment>
