<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's interiority and methodical hope are concrete and drive her choices; Ro's revealed memory and emotional response create a credible crucible. Their final collaboration is earned by prior causality, with the cost of shared vulnerability legible. Slight abstraction in describing emotional hinges ("that hurt was the hinge") prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: Mira's painting directly causes Ro's visit and their shared recognition. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost—Mira's approaching sleep as trust, and the community's awakening. The final image of writing "rouse" reconfigures the stakes without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The smog-choked city and rooftop greenhouse are not just backdrop; they pressure choice (isolation, glass as canvas) and charge the final glow of writing. Sensory details (saffron, soot, metal creak) are filtered through Mira's POV and integrated with action, constraining the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (proof kindness is remembered) are signaled early and escalate via Ro's arrival and recognition. Agency is clear: Mira's proposal of the experiment is a tightening choice that forecloses isolation. Cost is visible in their shared labor and the gifts that "land like proof."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through specific images (lost scripts, moon-tipped brush, shared bread) rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the word "rouse" and the glowing greenhouse—that reweights the concept of kindness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature. Prose rhythm modulates with pressure (e.g., shorter phrases at climax). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying crucial subtext in Ro's recognition. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density, though it flirts with overwriting in a few early lines ("daydreams sparked by moonlight began to move"). However, it maintains clarity and propulsion, with no loops or scaffold artifacts harming the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of lost languages, urban decay, and kindness as a transmitted script is fresh and specific. The core premise is transformed through grounded, lived detail (the brush, the jam, the grandmother's song). The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
