<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear, rooted in a history of unlearning hatred, and intensifies under pressure. Her interiority is concrete and contradictory (e.g., "expectantly resigned"), and her final choice—to let the quiet sit as a verdict—is an earned, meaningful endurance. Micro-choices like recording the chaos and asking singers to "give up" a sound reveal her values and tactical intelligence under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Strong causal lens: Mara's actions (repairing the zither, innovative rehearsals) lead directly to the fundraiser's impact. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) where the councilman's decision is catalyzed by the earned silence, with clear conceptual cost ("as if he too were crossing that long bridge of unlearning hatred"). The lens holds without ambiguity, and the final image is decisive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The "velvet library" and "cracked zither" are not just atmosphere; they pressure choice and charge the final image. The library's "traveled stillness" becomes the crucible for the performance. The zitter’s repaired rosette, framing "the dark hole like an eye," is a micro-setting object that reconfigures meaning at closure, constraining the story's logic and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving the arts wing) is signaled early and escalates through Mara's agency: her tactical rehearsal method directly tightens options and deepens the choir's cohesion. The cost is legible on-page in the council's shifted stance, earned by the protagonist's renunciation of pleading and the "subtracting noise" process. Pressure coheres and crescendos to the final, quiet verdict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of harmony versus erasure emerges organically from concrete particulars: the zither's "emptiness," the budget "stones," the act of "subtracting noise." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the councilman's unspoken realization, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext is rich in gesture and image (e.g., the "lace of shadow" on the sheet music).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable, close-third, with a distinct perceptual signature ("the hush as if it were a pilgrim returning"). Voice is lyrical yet controlled, modulating with pressure. One minor friction: phrases like "vanishing species" and "erased not by flames but by memos" edge toward thematic statement, slightly leaching the POV's embodied immediacy at those moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is largely exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor overwriting tendency appears in a few clustered metaphors (e.g., "hush as if it were a pilgrim returning," "threw a lace of shadow," "quiet, newly earned by subtracting noise") within the closure beat, creating a slight decorative density that does not obscure clarity but slightly softens the final image's impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar elements (arts advocacy, choir concert) into a fresh, specific, and inevitable whole through grounded detail (the miner's falsetto, Niko's flinch) and a non-obvious methodological core ("subtracting noise"). Risk-taking in the quiet, image-driven resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the synthesis feels organic and memorable.</comment>
