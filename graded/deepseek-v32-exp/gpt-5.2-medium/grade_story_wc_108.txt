<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's interior contradiction (fears vs. adaptive nature) drives credible micro-choices, and her final stance—using vulnerability as power—is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The boy's pain provides secondary pressure, though his introduction is slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a decisive change with on-page cost (confrontation risk, signing her name). Orientation is immediate; the boy's entry is motivated and does not break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rusted library constrains choice (catalog cards enable decryption) and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through Mara's professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency (decrypting notes, confronting Vaughn) under the causal lens; dominant stake (autonomy) tightens meaningfully, and cost is legible in the confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability as power emerges through events and images (seashell, cast, trembling certainty), not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV (third-person limited) is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical yet controlled under pressure, and any elision (e.g., shell's origins) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; minor overwriting in a few metaphoric lines ("moths skated...") does not harm closure clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and synthesized through specific, grounded choices (phobic stunt double, rebuilt face); risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
