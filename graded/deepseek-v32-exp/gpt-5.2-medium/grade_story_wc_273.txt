<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Keir’s “serene anger” and “consciously wild” trait are embodied in micro-choices under pressure, culminating in a risky, earned decision to destroy the obelisk. His motivation drives the plot, and the final resolve carries visible cost (ink expended, danger faced). No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate. Closure is a decisive change (obelisk destroyed, insight gained) with felt cost (ink used, risk taken). The persistent constraint of disappearing ink shapes tactics and the final image. No causality breaks; plot advances via because/therefore linkages.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (encampment, canyon) and objects (ink, drone) are vividly specific and constrain choices. The drone and ink are recurring tools that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; spatial choreography is coherent. Environment actively pressures action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover why time slows) escalates through Keir’s agency from investigation to confrontation. The obelisk destruction is a meaningful tightening that forecloses options with visible cost (ink depleted). Pressure coheres under the causal lens; no coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (profit from terror, calm anger as resistance) emerges through concrete events and the final note, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt; voice is distinct, poetic, and consistent. Perceptual signature is character-specific (tracker’s attention). No head‑hopping; purposeful compression (ink travel) is taught and pays off. Diction and rhythm heighten pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence‑level propulsion matches scene urgency. Figurative language (“bright thought that refused to land”) is voice‑motivated and pattern‑taught. Peak beats remain clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of tracker, disappearing ink, time‑manipulation, and drone feels inevitable in hindsight. Core premise is fresh; tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk‑taking (lyric compression, conceptual repricing) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
