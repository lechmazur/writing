<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orin's grief and inventive nature are concretely embodied; his final renunciation is earned by the stone's question and his realization about certainty, with visible cost in letting the moment pass.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a resonant Earned Stasis with on-page cost ("he let the moment pass unaltered"); orientation is clear early; the hunger stone's constraint shapes the entire climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is integral and pressure-bearing: the low tide creates a tangible window, the lighthouse and stone constrain choice, and the final image of the beam charges the closure with reweighted meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (changing the past) escalates through Orin's agency; the climax forces a trade-off with unmistakable cost—his surrender forecloses the path he sought, reconfiguring the stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of fate and acceptance emerges without statement; the ending offers a non-literal, resonant answer through the image of the lighthouse beam and Orin's life "beyond its blueprint."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, clockwork-inflected perceptual signature; rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and artifact-free; figurative language is coherent and purposeful; sentence-level propulsion varies with the beat, and the closure image lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of time-reversal, grief, and mystical objects feels inevitable; risk-taking in the quiet, renunciatory climax heightens stakes without gimmickry, fully integrated.</comment>
