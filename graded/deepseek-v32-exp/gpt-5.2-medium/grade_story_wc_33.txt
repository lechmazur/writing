<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ivo's motivation is clear and consistent, with interiority shown through concrete observation and micro-choices; his final decision to cross the border is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost as potential treason. The "respectfully rebellious" trait operates in scene, balancing official duty with personal rebellion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight and closure is decisive: Ivo's actions lead to a reply from the Mendery and his commitment to cross, with cost legible in "even if councils called it treason." Orientation is immediate, lens (Causal) holds, and the mail-drop constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the cobalt arcade hosts the mail drop and smugglers' launch, the drone border dictates movement, and the thunderstorm bottle is a recurring object that charges the climax and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Ivo's agency: fostering Nela triggers discovery of missing blocks, leading to confrontation and use of the bottle. The dominant stake (delivering promises) tightens as Ivo risks treason, with cost paid in the final decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of broken promises healing through delivery emerges from particulars like letters and the Mendery; the ending's resonant image—"healing did not mean undoing, only delivering what was owed"—reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and voice is distinct, with lyrical compression ("brittle hush," "thin as a folded envelope") and perceptual signature tied to Ivo's mailman perspective; no head-hopping, and elision (absences) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with strong rhythmic control; information density high, no loops or scaffold, and figurative language serves pressure (e.g., thunderstorm bottle burst). Closure image is clear and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mailman in disputed territory, smuggling drones, and weather-engineer relic feels inevitable; specific details (linking absences, cobalt arcade) heighten stakes without gimmickry, and closure commits fully to its premise.</comment>
