<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's occupation as a beautician mortician grounds her specific skills and worldview; her motivation to capture the "last spark" is concretely embodied in her actions and sensory perception. Contradictory impulses—the desire to preserve versus the realization that only temporary shelter is possible—are dramatized in the ritual, and her final renunciation (releasing the spark) is earned by the on-page revelation that the chip cannot grant return. The cost is visible in her empty hands and the chip's flash into the sky.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: Mara's goal (capture the spark) drives her to the grotto, the ritual reveals the chip's limits, and her choice to infuse the spark into the sky reconfigures her understanding. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—the relinquishment of the stored light—legible in the final image. Orientation is immediate and clear; the pattern of static reading is taught early and pays off at the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto and aurora are not merely picturesque; they enable the ritual by merging "aurora's whisper" with "planet's silence," making the static readable. The emerald chip and Orin's body function as micro-settings that constrain Mara's choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective, vivid, and filtered through her professional perception, elevating atmosphere to a active narrative force.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capturing the last spark—is signaled early and escalates through Mara's agency as she performs the ritual. The tightening occurs when she realizes the chip can only shelter the spark for a farewell, forcing a trade-off: she must release it to honor its meaning. Cost is unmistakable on the page in the chip's flash and her empty-handed descent, foreclosing the path of hoarding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete actions and images—the threshold of stillness, patterns in static, the emerald chip as temporary shelter. However, Orin's articulated lesson ("attention can keep the crossing from being cruel") risks thematic echo in the final third, slightly stating what the scene had already shown through Mara's realization and action. The final image of infusing the spark into the sky provides a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mara's professional lexicon and perceptual signature—noticing "suture beneath powder," "patterns in static," and "radiant hush." The voice is consistently poetic yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; all elision (the static's meaning) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and propulsive, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("pearl caught in a net of light") is consistent and voice-motivated. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, accelerating during the ritual and breathing at the end. No artifacts obscure causality or dull the closure image; the final line lands with clean, resonant cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of beautician mortician, skyborne grotto, and capturing sparks via static patterns is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The premise is transformed through specific, grounded details—Mara's professional gestures, the emerald chip's limited magic. Risk-taking in lyrical compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the final reconfiguration (releasing the spark) offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on grief and attention.</comment>
