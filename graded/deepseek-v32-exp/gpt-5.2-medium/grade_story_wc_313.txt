<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara's interior contradiction between duty and truth is embodied in micro-choices; her final renunciation of expunging is earned by the causal trail of photographs with visible cost in the boot print and father's lie.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from silent chime to revelation; closure is a decisive change (sharing truth) with felt cost in the boot print and redacted report; orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (reservoir, ridgeway, bar) constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, e.g., "dark mirror" and "glisten" roofs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from professional duty to moral audit via Mara's agency; cost is legible in her photographing evidence and public speech, foreclosing the path of silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth vs. curation emerges through images (chime, label, boot print); ending reweights prior material without moralizing, offering resonant ambiguity in "let the chime sing."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature ("water sounds like listening"); rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping; elision (father's order) taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without loops or scaffold; high information density (e.g., "turning these into a new trail"); figurative language is coherent and closure is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of environmental and personal guilt; specific details (liqueur label, photographs) transform the trope; risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
