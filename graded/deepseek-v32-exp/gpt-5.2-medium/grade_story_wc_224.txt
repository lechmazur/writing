<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in pain; interiority is embodied through physical sensations like numb hands and metal taste. The choice to seed the stone with a raw memory is earned by prior causality, with visible cost as pain shuts the throat. The seer applies pressure but remains slightly archetypal, though functional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from painful memory to quest, stone ritual, and closure. Orientation is immediate; closure is a decisive change with felt cost on-page ("pain tried to shut my throat"). The buried talent constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—bookstore as mountain archive with hidden thunder—and actively pressures choices: labyrinthine shelves require guidance, shifting reality forces hasty naming. The stone and feather as micro-settings constrain action and charge the final image of the doorway cut into basalt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding home) escalates through protagonist's agency: seer's test about buried talent forces confrontation, and seeding the stone with true memory tightens options with unmistakable cost. The climax is driven by choice, not coincidence, under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory, pain, and home emerges through concrete images (language stone, feather, curve of shoreline) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—home as a crescent shoreline—that reweights prior material with emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature favors metaphorical observation ("mercury-glass seer," "feather prickled with cold"). Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven, and no head-hopping disrupts the focused interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density, yet clear and propelled by varied syntax. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; figurative language ("hidden thunder," "sleeping fish") is coherent and supports atmosphere without muddying peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is fresh—bookstore mountain as memory archive—and synthesized with specific details (mercury-glass seer, texture-of-feather method). Turns feel inevitable in hindsight; emotional truth avoids generic templates, and risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
