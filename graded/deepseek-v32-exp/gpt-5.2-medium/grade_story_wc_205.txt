<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Len’s characterization is rich with interior contradiction ("burnished sorrow," defunct revolutionary clinging to longing), and his final choice to collaborate with Yara is earned by prior causality. Yara is equally nuanced, their status dynamics legible. The final micro-choice to project the blurred map reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Minor deduction for a slight tendency toward abstract emotional labels ("burnished sorrow") in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing: the exhibition that embraces blurred, branching visions reweights the premise of the dispute with undeniable conceptual and social cost ("arguing differently"). The drive lens is Hybrid (causal setup, accumulative/textural escalation), held cleanly. Orientation is immediate, and the persistent constraint of the shard and mirrors shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is not decorative but a crucible. The "visible time" and "baroque asteroid" are taught early and actively constrain choice (mirrors show futures, storm forces the velvet covering, strata blur the map). The final image is charged by the environment. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully filtered through Len's poetic perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (how to interpret/claim the past) escalates coherently from personal negotiation to storm-induced crisis to collaborative third act. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the hybrid lens (Len covers the mirrors, they choose to view the alcove). The cost is legible in their forfeiture of singular certainty for a shared, ambiguous exhibition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of fragmentation, interpretation, and the cost of certainty emerges organically from the vase shard, the map, and the mirrored futures. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the act of projecting a blurred map and the simile "the way a vase becomes more honest when broken." Avoids moralizing; complexity is embraced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled—poetic, precise, and consistently filtered through Len's perception. POV is stable third-person limited. Diction and syntax modulate with pressure (e.g., the compressed, urgent description of the storm). Any elision (the exact nature of the revolution) is purposeful and paid off in thematic weight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative texture. Minor artifact: a slight register elevation in phrases like "burnished sorrow" feels slightly detached from Len's immediate lexicon. No loops or muddle that harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The core premise—visible time as a physical, plot-driving phenomenon—is fresh and fully integrated with character and theme. The synthesis of archaeological dispute, personal history, and sci-fi conceit feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in the quiet, conceptual closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
