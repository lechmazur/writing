<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motive—finding where unused love is stored—is concrete and drives her micro-choices under pressure; interiority is embodied via spatial imagination and the cost of tearing letters; final renunciation (writing "deliver" not farewell) is earned by the vision of Eli and her own ritual, with visible cost in the softened storm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mara's act reweights unused love into deliverance, with cost legible in the whispered thunder and resting lyrics; orientation is immediate, causality intact through patterned deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is micro-specific—the booth as a "small universe"—and constrains choice via the projector and film strip; sensory details (rain like folding velvet) are selective and POV-filtered; the environment charges the final image of open envelopes and hidden chambers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unused love) escalates under accumulative density as Mara's psychometry reveals Eli's story; agency is clear in her decision to project light and read letters, forcing a trade-off that forecloses passive longing with cost felt in the booth's expansion and delivered letter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars—film strips, goodbye letters—without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: unused love is stored in unfinished rituals, reweighting prior material through the image of lyrics finding tune in sprocket clatter.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct with a perceptual signature (spatially imaginative); voice is poetic yet controlled, modulating with pressure ("hush rolled through her"); no head-hopping, and elision (forgotten lyrics) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically varied with high information density; zero loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language ("thunder that has learned to whisper") is consistent and heightens closure; sentence-level propulsion aligns with emotional beats without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crystal gazer, psychometry, and film archaeology feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in lyrical accumulative design pays off with specificity; the core premise transforms familiar tropes through grounded detail and emotional cost.</comment>
