<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving her choices under pressure. Her final act of dismantling the mast is earned by prior causality with a visible cost (the surrendered spear, the lighter city). However, interior contradiction and embodied emotion under peak stress are not deeply explored, keeping the characterization from reaching the highest tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from tuning to dismantling. Orientation is immediate and vivid. Closure is a decisive conceptual repricing: the city transforms from a loudspeaker to a listening post. The cost is legible on the page in the mast’s silent fall and the city ringing "lighter by one arrogance."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, not just atmospheric. The abandoned radio tower city over a gorge constrains every choice and charges the final image—the mast vanishes into the gorge, making the setting a key player in the closure. Sensory details (ozone, humming cables) are filtered through Mara’s professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (salvaging a pattern before the city is scrapped) escalates cleanly under the causal lens via Mara’s agency. The tightening is meaningful: discovering the pulse forces the irreversible choice to dismantle the mast. Cost is visible in the physical labor and the surrendered structure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (listening vs. broadcasting, finding beginnings in endings) emerges organically from actions and the central object. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the city retuned to receive, reweighting the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable, single, and distinct. The narrative voice has a precise, lyrical-perceptual signature ("the practical cadence of orbits") that reflects Mara’s expertise. Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure, and any elision (e.g., the council's decision) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and impeccably controlled. High information density with zero loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is consistent and sharp ("scaffold for another world," "surrendered spear"). Sentence-level propulsion varies perfectly with the beat, and the final image lands with clarity and charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis is fresh and inevitable: celestial signal interpretation, a "shard of hush," and fantasy practicality coalesce into a unique vision. The core premise is transformed through specific, lived detail and a non-obvious moral calculus (dismantling arrogance to enable listening). Risk-taking in concept and style heightens stakes.</comment>
