<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Irena's characterization is precise and dynamic; her core contradiction—impatience sculpted into strategic patience—is embodied through concrete micro-choices (watching, charting, waiting). The final choice (sabotage via absence) is earned by prior causality, and her restraint is a visible cost. The rebels' "restrained wildness" mirrors her internal struggle, adding depth without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens is clear and held: Irena's vow drives a sequence of because/therefore linkages (observation → planning → execution). Closure is a decisive change (the viaduct neutralized, Irena "patient at last") with felt cost in the risk and disciplined labor. The final image ("draw a new horizon") reconfirms the change. Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable and pressure-applying: the frozen lake dictates travel; the basalt sanctuary's iron filings affect the viaduct; the moon paths are a tactical tool. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("boots squeaking on ice," "lake groan under the ice"). The environment constrains choice and charges the final image, achieving micro-setting integration at the highest level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (the revolution's success through patient tactics) is signaled early and escalates via Irena's agency under the causal lens. The key tightening is her decision to study and exploit the viaduct's "tides" rather than sabotage it impatiently. The cost is legible in the disciplined, silent labor of the rebels and the risk of the chosen night. The closure forecloses the option of haste.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (patience as a revolutionary, sculptural force) emerges organically from concrete particulars—mapping, moon-tracking, unyoking. Subtext operates through image and action (e.g., "sculpt patience from impatience"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: patience is not surrender but a "shape they could carve together." No moralizing; the final image reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable, closely focalized through Irena with a distinct perceptual signature (professional mapper's attention to lines, arcs, and magnetic reactions). The prose's rhythmic control and lyrical density are voice-motivated and never obscure causality. No head-hopping; dialogue is absent but not required.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and poetic without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Sentences do multiple jobs ("The bridge was meant to yoke the entire region into predictable lanes, and for a moment her impatience surged..."). No loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating in the execution beat. Information density is high throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—horizon mapper, patient revolution, magnetic viaduct, lunar tactics—is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (rebel vs. empire) are transformed through grounded, character-driven choices (patience as weapon). The core premise offers a non-obvious angle on resistance, fully committed to its implications. A singular artistic stance.</comment>
