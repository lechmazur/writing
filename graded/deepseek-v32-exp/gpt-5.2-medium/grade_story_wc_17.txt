<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is layered (professional commission, personal quest) and concretely embodied through her mapping actions. Her final choice—to deceive the office and privately preserve the chamber—is a resonant, earned stasis that forecloses a public path with visible cost. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. guardianship) act within the scene, culminating in a micro-choice (the false map, the final chord) that reveals her hierarchy of values. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority is specific and anchored in perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: each discovery (diary, film strip, chamber) logically enables the next and narrows options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): her submission of the false map and private promise reconfigure her role from cartographer to guardian, with cost legible in the final image. Orientation is immediate and functional. The persistent constraint of the Restoration Office's expectations shapes her final, decisive tactic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressure-applying: the ivy-veiled passage forces entry; the cracked stone and fireplace are sites of discovery. The film negative strip (a micro-setting object) crucially constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail ("air tasted of soot," "vines had pushed through the ceiling") is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Liora's professional perception. Spatial choreography is coherent and evolves with her progress.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving authentic memory vs. public commodification) is signaled early and escalates cleanly under the causal lens. The discovery of the diary's truth and the drones' presence force a tightening choice. Liora's agency drives the escalation: her decision to submit a false map is a major turn that forecloses an option with clear, on-page cost (professional deception, isolating the legacy). The cost is felt in her solitary final action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of carrying legacy "carefully forward" emerges organically from the concrete particulars of mapping, diaries, and archived voices. Subtext operates through the grandfather's refusal and Liora's parallel choice. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through her act of selective preservation—a conceptual repricing of her role without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from the specific friction between public restoration and private grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by Liora's acoustical sensitivity. The prose texture is lyrical yet precise, modulating effectively with discovery and decision. Purposeful compression ("the legacy's burden settled on her chest") increases density without obscuring causality. No head-hopping; all elision (e.g., the diary's exact contents) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and highly controlled, with varied rhythm and sentence structure that supports momentum. Information density is high (lines advance plot, character, and atmosphere). A slight tendency toward complex syntax and figurative language ("breathed salt fog") is consistent and voice-motivated, not ornamental. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; the final paragraph lands with clear, charged propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of echo cartography, climate-shift setting, and architecturally preserved memory is strikingly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and explored through specific, grounded choices in character and plot. The risk of a quiet, conceptual climax (a decision to conceal) heightens stakes and meaning without gimmickry. The premise is transformed through lived detail and moral calculus.</comment>
