<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara’s characterization is concrete and consistent; her calmly intuitive nature and motivation to “map empathy onto action” are shown through micro-choices (using mirrors, reconstituting the ball). The fisherman and glaciologist gain depth via mirror-glimpses, turning private fears into shared duties. A slight lack of interior contradiction under pressure keeps it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: Mara’s investigation → mirror insights → reconstitution → plan. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the “courageous anomaly” is redefined as the community’s unused courage, charging the final image with trust. Cost is legible in the risk of ice and transformed duties. Orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the lighthouse orchard and ice floes apply constant pressure; the vintage store mirrors are a micro-setting that constrains choice by revealing subtext. Sensory details are selective and woven through action (e.g., “lantern room glowed like a patient eye”). The environment directly shapes the climax and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (balance prediction vs. care) escalates through Mara’s agency: she moves from observation to actively reconstituting the ball and devising a shared plan. The tightening forecloses the either/or argument, creating a cost (shared risk and duty). Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict: empathy made actionable, courage as communal. The “courageous anomaly” reprice at the end offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through the mirrors and the fragment’s reaction. No abstract statements; all earned through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and filtered through Mara’s perceptual signature (noticing “quarrels,” “pulse of warmth”). Voice is distinct, lyrical but controlled. Minimal dialogue serves the conflict. No head‑hopping; psychic distance is consistent. Slight register elevation in descriptive passages is voice‑motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic but maintains propulsion; sentences advance story and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Rhythm varies with scene needs. A few complex syntactic constructions momentarily slow momentum, but clarity and closure impact remain untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh, non‑obvious synthesis of elements (peacekeeper, magical‑realist mirrors, glacial science). The “courageous anomaly” concept transforms in hindsight. Risks taken with a quiet, conceptual closure are fully committed and heighten stakes. Specificity avoids template plots; feels organic and inevitable.</comment>
