<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's hunger for memory texture is concretely embodied via synesthetic perception; micro-choices under pressure (collecting fragments, investigating solvent) align with motives and culminate in an earned renunciation—whispering names to become a vessel—with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where layered fragments reconfigure meaning, cost legible in "nameless, alive" and "gained a grain." Orientation anchored early, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Container maze and tidal rhythm pressure choices (tide clock dictates access) and charge the final image; sensory details (salt air, chalk marks, kelp smell) are selective, POV-filtered, and integral to the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming history through texture) escalates via protagonist's agency—collecting stories, finding label, discovering container—under accumulative lens; cost is unmistakable in the final trade-off: namelessness for layered memory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of erasure and identity emerges implicitly from particulars (death certificate, solvent, erased files); ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—identity as a vessel for stories—without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV stable with distinct perceptual signature (sound into touch); voice is consistently lyrical yet grounded, rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hopping, elision taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density; sentences advance story, character, atmosphere; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; rhythm varies naturally, supporting the accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of erased history, port bureaucracy, and sensory memory; risk-taking in accumulative, lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; concept feels inevitable in hindsight, transformed through specific detail.</comment>
