<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eren's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in guilt and a promise, driving his actions and final choice. His precognitive curse provides compelling internal contradiction and shapes his micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation (to stay and teach) is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Some interior emotion leans toward summary at peaks, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Eren chooses to stay and teach, foreclosing a life of running with a clear, felt cost ("breathing the borrowed dawn as if it were Lysa's last breath returned"). Orientation is immediate, and the final image reweights prior material decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The frictionless tidal bluff under the aurora is a masterfully integrated setting that actively constrains every choice (the harness, sliding) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through Eren's professional and emotional priorities, making the environment indispensable to the plot's logic and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Eren's promise/guilt) is signaled early and escalates through his agency with the dust and rocks, tightening toward the climactic sea opening. The cost of his choice—to forego escape and embrace a teacher's role—is legible on the page. The escalation is coherent and driven by protagonist action under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of guilt, forgiveness, and sacred patterns emerge organically from concrete particulars (the dust, the rocks, the rope). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the revealed word "Forgive" and Eren's subsequent choice, reweighting the narrative without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable and deeply filtered through Eren's perceptive signature, blending lyrical observation with mathematical precision. The voice is distinct and controlled, modulating with emotional pressure. Minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or distance issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and highly propulsive, with excellent rhythmic control and vivid imagery. Information density is high, with sentences performing multiple jobs. Minor instances of slightly overwrought phrasing ("breathing the borrowed dawn...") slightly slow momentum but do not harm closure clarity or cause figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a frictionless world, precognition, mathematical mysticism, and eel herding is strikingly original and feels organic, not checklist-driven. The core premise is fully committed to, with specific, grounded choices that heighten stakes. The emotional truth and transformation of familiar themes (guilt, forgiveness) feel fresh and inevitable.</comment>
