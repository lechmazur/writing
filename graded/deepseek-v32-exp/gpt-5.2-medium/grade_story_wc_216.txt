<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is concrete and dramatized through embodied actions; his final choice to trade the urn fragment is earned by prior curiosity and loss, with visible cost when his borrowed year slips away. Interiority avoids stock phrasing, and his transformation from seeker to keeper feels inevitable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure lands on-page as a resonant reconfiguration (Eli becomes timeless and accepts a new duty) with felt cost in "his borrowed year slip off him like a coat." Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres through pattern and sensation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The emerald silo and time capsule are micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details like "green light folded inward like a closing eyelid" are selective and purposeful, filtered through Eli's POV to deepen atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding time's texture) escalates under the accumulative lens through Eli's agency; his trade of the urn fragment forces a costly foreclosure of his former state, reweighting options toward a duty sensed, not measured.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from particulars like grief-as-ballast and coded tags; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Eli's written description, reweighting prior material without moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature; voice modulates with emotional intensity ("as if faith could tick") and maintains rhythmic control without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the capsule's activation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes numbers losing meaning, timekeeping, and grief with fresh specificity; risk-taking in accumulative, lyric design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and turns feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
