<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s characterization is precise and embodied: her curiosity is a tactile, investigative trait (“listened past words”), her grief is shown through physical sensation (“throat felt full of ash”), and her final choice to give Eli the photograph is a micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values (protection over personal closure). The only minor slip is a slight diagnostic tinge in “wanting silence did not mean he had to surrender to it,” which abstracts the emotional moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara, having traced the chain and revised its message, sits in “earned stasis,” feeling her own “stubborn, curious life.” The causal lens holds tightly—the photograph’s arrival triggers her investigation, the hearing aid pulses guide her, and her intervention with Eli directly stems from her traced connections. Cost is legible in the image of her throat full of ash and the warm hearing aid as a relic of survival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is atmospheric and functional: the “mist-clad atrium” and “sweating” windows establish tone and isolation, while the old auditorium wing and stairwell are micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the climax. The hearing aid and photograph are recurring objects that decisively constrain action and reconfigure the final image (the smudged “PLEASE”). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara’s professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect vulnerable voices) escalates cleanly under the causal lens: the impersonal call becomes personal (the photograph is of Mara), the threat concretizes (Eli on the landing), and Mara’s agency—tracing, sitting beside him, speaking into the phone—narrows options and forces a trade-off (confronting her own trauma to break the chain). Cost is felt in her ash-filled throat and the fading pulses of relinquished grief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (grief loops but can be revised by the living) emerges powerfully through the photographed sign’s transformation from “STAY” to “STAY, PLEASE” and Mara’s culminating line: “the dead could only repeat what they died believing, but the living could revise it.” This is a non-literal, earned answer that reweights the story’s core concept without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (slipping the photograph into Eli’s pocket).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable, close-third Mara with a distinct perceptual signature—professional, tactile, metaphorically rich (“contact tracer for hearts”). Voice modulates under pressure, compressing in crisis (“She did not grab him”) and expanding in reflective moments. The prose’s lyrical rhythm is controlled and purposeful. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Eli’s silent presence and the dead mother’s voice are effectively filtered through Mara’s perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is densely lyrical and generally precise, with strong rhythmic control. A minor paraphrase loop occurs in the first paragraph (“waited for the first rings that always came when the dead call” is conceptually restated in “contact tracer for hearts”). One metaphorical strain (“the air held a reeling hush”) slightly blurs sense. Otherwise, sentences advance character and atmosphere with high information density, and the closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise is a fresh, specific synthesis: a grief-contact tracer using a technological relic to track supernatural pulses. The concept is fully committed to and integrated through lived detail (the cracked hearing aid, the smudged photograph). The emotional truth—revising inherited trauma—feels inevitable in hindsight. The story avoids template plotting through its unique voice and grounded, tactile magic system.</comment>
