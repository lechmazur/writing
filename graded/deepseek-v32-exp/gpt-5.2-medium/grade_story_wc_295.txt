<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "tears dried into salt"). Relationship with Nera acts as crucible, forcing micro-choices that reveal values. Final choice to share burdens is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from inciting incident to closure. Orientation is immediate; closure is a Conceptual Repricing ("decoding was not conquering a secret but keeping faith with it") with felt cost in the cooled air and shared burdens image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting (observatory, temple, salt flats) is filtered through professional POV and constrains choices; variable stars and inscriptions directly shape tactics. The final image of stars flickering above the broken roof charges the closure with reweighted meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode inscriptions) escalates through protagonist's agency under causal lens: entering dream, translating, performing rite. Cost is legible in emotional weight and the cooled air; one meaningful tightening forecloses solitary grief via shared witness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of shared burdens and healing through witness emerges organically from particulars (dream revelation, rite). Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via conceptual repricing, avoiding moralizing; subtext operates in gesture and image (e.g., air cooling).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (lyrical, professional). Voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping; diction and rhythm control heighten urgency in dream and closure beats. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("ship stalled in black water") is purposeful and consistent; sentences advance story and character. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise of lucid dreaming to decode star-based inscriptions is fresh and transformed through specific details (daylily telegram, salt flats). Synthesis feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical prose and conceptual closure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
