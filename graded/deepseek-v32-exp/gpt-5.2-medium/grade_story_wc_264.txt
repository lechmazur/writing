<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Guard's motivation is concrete and drives escalating choices; interiority is embodied in action (e.g., "tending to what others missed"). Final renunciation of stasis for perpetual balance is earned by prior wave-function learning, with cost visible in the ending's vigilant care. Lacks contradictory impulses in scene, but agency remains coherent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is Charged Poise with cost legible in "nurse the bloom until light could spread beyond my watch." Orientation is anchored early; structure moves from discovery to auditors' confrontation via taught pattern of divergence. Persistent constraint (midnight clock) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting (glowing dune, chess clock) actively constrains choices and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("each grain lit from within"). Micro-setting as archive enables guard's splitting; spatial choreography remains clear across shards.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving divergent archive) escalates under Accumulative lens via density of guard's multi-placement and auditors' arrival. Agency drives tightening: guard uses wave functions to offer charm, forcing auditors back. Cost is unmistakable in perpetual balance required to hold midnight open.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (care vs. collapse) emerges implicitly from images and action; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through guard's nursing of the bloom. Subtext operates in motif reweighting (sparks, clock) without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers via concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature ("nights do not fall so much as fracture"). Voice is lyrical and fractured, modulating under pressure; elision (wave functions) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; rhythmic control supports accumulative density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language coheres ("a lullaby sung in broken measures") and propels momentum; no artifacts obscure closure. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, from quiet observation to confrontational peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic freight guarding with quantum-infused archive feels inevitable; risk-taking in surreal, lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details (chess clock, ember seeds) are irreplaceable; emotional truth anchors in guard's motivation to cultivate sparks.</comment>
