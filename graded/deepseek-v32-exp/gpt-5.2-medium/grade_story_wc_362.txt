<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Narrator's interiority is concrete and contradictory; Lio's grounded mysticism is consistent. Final renunciation earned through on-page commune with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as decisive change with felt cost; causal lens holds from orientation through revelation; prism and car as constraints shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Quartz arbor, frost-patterned windshield, and prism function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding sister's last drive tightens via narrator's agency in naming anger and accepting prism; cost is legible in the shifted hush and release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of objects absorbing emotions emerges from particulars; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through the prism's light and the narrator's truthful lie.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct lyrical voice; Lio's dialogue carries subtext; perceptual signature is sharp under pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with varied rhythm and zero loops; figurative language ("like water in stone") is purposeful and cohesive, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief narrative with supernatural object‑memory; risk‑taking in lyrical commune heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; transformation feels inevitable.</comment>
