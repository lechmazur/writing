<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's embodied grief and Orin's moral ambiguity are concrete; interior contradictions drive micro-choices under pressure, and the final ritual is earned with visible cost when petals scatter without comfort.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in "the remade hush settling in my chest." Orientation anchored early, and persistent constraints (turbines, bouquet) shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting (turbines, farmhouse) and objects (bouquet, carved bird) constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, mirroring internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultivating lightness in grief) escalates under accumulative lens through narrator's agency; cost is unmistakable in the acceptance without surge of comfort during the ritual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars without moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("lightness was not happiness but permission to let grief move") that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and controlled, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; dialogue (when present) is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and clear, advancing story and atmosphere without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief, performance, and post-mandate world; specific details (whittling, narration of chores) feel inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
