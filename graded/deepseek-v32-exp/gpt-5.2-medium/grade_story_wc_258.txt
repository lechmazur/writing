<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Narrator's "steadily curious" interiority and Aurel's stained-finger specificity drive credible micro-choices; final commitment to publish and collaborate earned by prior causality with visible cost in taking on inherited responsibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the inheritance as ongoing inquiry; Accumulative/Textural lens holds with cost legible in the promise to publish; orientation clear early, pattern taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting vividly constrains choice: loft beams align sketches, rain imagery stitches scenes; measuring tape as micro-setting charges final image; sensory detail selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake in mapping cultural patterns escalates through reverse-engineering agency; cost legible in commitment to share findings; one meaningful tightening under accumulative lens when they return with a map.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from actions—reconstruction over prophecy; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext in gestures like ink-stained fingers and folded tape.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct poetic voice; dialogue natural and goal-driven; perceptual signature clear in selective noticing; rhythmic control under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose dense and lyrical with high information density; no loops or scaffold; figurative language consistent and purposeful; sentences advance story with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartomancy, measurement, and cultural analysis; risk-taking in genre blending pays off; specific details create inevitability in hindsight.</comment>
