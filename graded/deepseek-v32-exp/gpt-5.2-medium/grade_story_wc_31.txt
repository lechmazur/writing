<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interior contradiction and micro-choices under pressure are concrete; final vow is earned by prior causality with visible cost when honesty turns from shield to lens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a conceptual repricing with felt cost as sound blooms violet, and the key tag's role shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image—the sunken ship library pressures discovery; sensory detail is selective and woven through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering color of sound) escalates via protagonist's agency; cost is legible in the transformation during the vow, narrowing options under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the vow and the reconfiguration of honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; poetic diction and rhythm control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and clear in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-as-color and sunken library feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
