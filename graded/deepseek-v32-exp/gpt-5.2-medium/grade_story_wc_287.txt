<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete and character-particular (“wistfully pragmatic,” fear without a task kills her), and her final choice to install mirrors arises credibly from her gardening practice. The relationship with Jonas applies subtle pressure, and her micro-choice to take the broken tooth “like a seed” reveals hierarchy of values. A hairline slip: the final stance crystallization leans slightly toward thematic statement rather than purely embodied choice, but closure remains earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (smugglers stopped) and a resonant reconfiguration (garden as practice for saving), cost legible in the risk taken and the new understanding. Causal linkages are tight, orientation is immediate, and the hybrid lens (causal with accumulative texture) holds without contradiction. The persistent constraint of the garden/mirrors shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective (fire escape garden, luminous harbor, mirror shards), filtered through Mara’s POV and constraining choice: the garden supplies the method, the harbor pressures the investigation. The final image is charged by the micro-setting (mirrors on the iron steps). Sensory detail is purposeful and woven through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (overcoming fear through useful task) is signaled early and tightens via Mara’s agency: she chooses to help, uses her skills, and discovers the scratch. Escalation is driven by causal linkage under the hybrid lens, with cost felt in the vulnerability during the inspection. One meaningful turn (finding the false pattern) narrows options and leads to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (light vs. darkness, practical courage) emerges organically through recurring images (mirrors, petals, oars) and the final non-literal answer: “darkness is not a room you must stay in.” Subtext operates in gesture and silence; the core concept integrates without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and close, with a distinct perceptual signature (lyrical, observant). Voice modulates with emotional intensity but remains consistent. Purposeful compression (transition to harbor) is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or distance issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly controlled, with varied sentence structures and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is precise and pattern-taught (“like a seed,” “bones in the moonlight”). Information density is high; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. No artifacts obscure causality or dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fire escape gardener and lockmaster feels inevitable in hindsight; the use of mirror shards from gardening to inspect locks is inventive and organic. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates. Risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise is transformed through grounded, character-driven detail.</comment>
