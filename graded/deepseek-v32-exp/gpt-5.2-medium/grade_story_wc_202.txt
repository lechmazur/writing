<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in embodied emotion; micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing the spiral and unfastening the hatch, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal linkages drive the plot from the darkening lens to the reunification; closure lands with a decisive change—the seam held steady—and cost is legible in the lens's flare and the eternal instant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The alchemist's market and lighthouse lens fragment are vividly specific; the lens constrains choice and charges the final image, with sensory details like "cold light breathed up" woven into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to honor overlooked histories escalates through protagonist agency—using the lens, opening the hatch—with unmistakable cost in the lens darkening and the final flare.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of translation, intuition, and memory feels inevitable; specific details like the lighthouse lens and hidden spirals transform the premise through grounded choices.</comment>
