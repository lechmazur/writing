<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Kestrel's interior contradiction is embodied in the crowded borrowed selves; her final renunciation returns her to center with visible cost from prior experiments, earning the change through causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing (empathy as transformation) with cost legible in "every transfer cost her a little coherence"; orientation is clear early and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The topaz workshop and halo fragment constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Kestrel's professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kestrel's agency under the accumulative lens, from experimenting to the final blank broadside, with cost unmistakable in her lost coherence and the townspeople's alignment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—empathy as transformation—earned by Kestrel's specific struggles and the equation's arithmetic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; lyrical compression and rhythmic control under pressure, e.g., "stars overhead shivered, winking in and out," without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is clear and purposeful, e.g., "borrowed selves argued in different tenses," advancing story without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of letterpress operation, empathy transposition, and mathematical emotion; risk-taking with conceptual framework heightens stakes and coherence, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
