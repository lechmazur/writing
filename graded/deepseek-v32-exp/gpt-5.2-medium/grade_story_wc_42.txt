<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her expertise, with her father's teaching and Lio's memory adding depth. Her micro-choice to use the leaf fall method reveals her values under pressure, but interior contradiction is underdeveloped, and the emotional epiphany about loss is slightly neat. The final choice is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a Decisive Change (clock fixed, pod launched) with a Resonant Reconfiguration ("restructured time... to let loss escape") that lands with felt cost. Orientation is immediate, structure is a single coherent scene, and the earthquake constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated and pressures choice: the observatory's fragility, the quake, the leaf cylinder, and the moon all constrain action and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's professional POV, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing the micrometeor swarm) tightens under earthquake pressure; escalation is driven by Mara's agency in restructuring the clock. Cost is legible in the memory of Lio and the physical risk, foreclosing the option of failure with visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of harnessing the ephemeral and confronting loss emerges through concrete particulars (leaf, clock, launch) without statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal reweighting via the image of restructuring time, avoiding moralizing and embracing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet precise, reflecting Mara's expertise and emotional state. No head-hopping; diction remains within her lexicon, and rhythmic control supports pressure. No dialogue present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density; figurative language is purposeful and consistent. No loops, scaffold, or clarity issues; sentence rhythm varies effectively, and the closure image is sharp. Minor overwriting in peak beats does not obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of technical problem-solving and poetic meditation on time and loss; specific, non-obvious details (leaf fall timer, micrometeor flashes) feel inevitable. Risk-taking in blending elevated diction with concrete action heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
