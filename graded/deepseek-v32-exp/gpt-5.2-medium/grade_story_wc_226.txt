<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara's defiance and artistry are concretely embodied in ink-stained fingers and glass prisms; her motivation to refract truth is rooted in guilt and drives higher-stakes choices. Internal conflict between mischievous innocence and solemn purpose is shown through micro-choices like trading a doodle and weaving hidden accusations into poetry. The final renunciation of her art is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in lost color vision. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are filtered through an artist's perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: Mara's actions (poetry sessions, prism use) directly lead to the killer's exposure and her sacrifice. Closure is a decisive change with legible cost: she is forgiven but loses color vision after destroying her art. Orientation is clear within 120 words (Mara, canyon, dawn ritual). The canyon's price-for-forgiveness rule shapes tactics and charges the ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the canyon's echoes refract sound, enabling Mara's plan; bone towers and pale spire constrain choice and charge the climax with scattered rainbows. Sensory details (ash-colored sky, chalk-scented hands) are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's artist POV. The environment actively pressures tactics and evolves from "forged hush" to "listening metal."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (exposing truth for forgiveness) is signaled early and escalates through Mara's agency: she uses poetry to refract accusations, tightening pressure until the killer lunges. Cost is unmistakable on-page: she surrenders her art and loses color vision. Under the causal lens, escalation narrows options via because/therefore linkages (poetry → refracted truth → exposure).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme (truth, art, sacrifice) emerges organically from events and images, not statement. Subtext operates in poetry and prism refraction. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: truth outliving the artist, but the final line ("smiled at the thought...") leans slightly explicit, though earned by prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Mara's artist perception, with distinct rhythmic control ("forged hush," "pale ribs"). Dialogue is minimal but natural (Jalen's snort). Voice maintains a lyrical, mythic texture that modulates with pressure, no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid, with varied syntax and purposeful figurative language ("listening metal," "rainbows trembling on bone"). No paraphrase loops, template cadence, or figurative muddle; information advances story and character. Line-level propulsion accelerates from hush to humming climax, and the final image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mythic setting, artistic truth-telling, and ritual price feels inevitable in hindsight. The concept of refraction through poetry and prisms transforms familiar tropes with specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyrical tone and non-violent climax heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
