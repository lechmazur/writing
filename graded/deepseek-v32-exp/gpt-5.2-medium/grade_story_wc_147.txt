<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses (instinct to flee vs. override) act in scene; her final choice to breathe the perfumed hush is earned by prior causality (mother's vial, desire to harness the ephemeral) with visible cost (failing rebreather). Interiority is concrete and embodied ("her eyes stung").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the hush thins, message sent) with felt cost (air gauge at "last trembling bars"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building density of imagery and meaning; the wire knot functions as a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Environment (underwater temple, rebreather, vial) constrains choices and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("silver beads that wandered up into the vaulted dark"); spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency (unsnarling kelp, using vial) under Accumulative lens; cost is unmistakable ("air hissed thin in her mask"). Dominant stake (survival/communication) tightens as time runs short.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of ephemerality and memory emerges through particulars (vial, hush, mirror); ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via "pulse of shared recollection." No moralizing; subtext operates in image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure ("every pillar furred with coral"). Single POV stable; lyric compression is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent ("like unanswered prayers"). Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis (underwater salvage meets metaphysical memory reservoir) feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking with lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; transformation of tropes through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
