<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Samir’s gentle radicalism is embodied in micro-choices (the iron frame, the Grasp) and contradicts Lina’s vengeful stance, creating a crucible that forces her change. His vow “to cradle empathy in arms of steel” is tested and earns the truce’s cost—the burden of mercy felt in the cousin’s trembling and the shared bread.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: retrocognitive vision → tessera discovery → Lina’s conversion → cousin’s restraint. Closure is a decisive change (the truce and renaming) with cost legible in “their chewing was the first quiet truce… and Samir felt the past loosen.” Orientation is immediate; pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mosaic stepping stone acts as micro-setting that constrains choice (visions dictate route) and charges the final image (tessera fitted “like truth into a wound”). Sensory details (stones rinsed white, blue tessera, soot) are filtered through Samir’s retrocognitive perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mercy vs. revenge) escalates via Samir’s agency: he uses the stone to force Lina’s recognition, then offers a third choice. Cost is visible in Lina’s drained face, her bitter laugh, and the cousin’s trembling under the Grasp.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of aberrant mercy emerges through concrete images (the Grasp, the renamed Haven of Hands) without moralizing. The ending’s “quiet truce” reweights prior trauma via a resonant, non‑literal answer—empathy as a labor, not absolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third‑person limited voice maintains a poetic, measured rhythm that mirrors Samir’s patience. Dialogue is spare and goal‑driven (Lina’s spat, Samir’s quiet reply). No head‑hopping; perceptual signature is distinct (“warmth that felt cold”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet precise, with high information density (“a ruin could be a mirror”). Figurative language is consistent and purposeful; no loops or scaffold. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the vision and slowing at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of retrocognitive trap, aberrant mercy, and the Grasp feels inevitable. Risk‑taking (non‑violent resolution, conceptual repricing via renaming) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The combination is organic, not checklist‑driven.</comment>
