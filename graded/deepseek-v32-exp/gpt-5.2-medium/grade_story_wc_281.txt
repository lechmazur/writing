<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara’s "affectionate skepticism" is embodied in micro-choices (hugging the lawyer, squeezing Jory’s hand) and her pivotal methodological shift from demanding proof to devising a somatic test. Her renunciation of needing to "believe in magic" in favor of believing in "patterns the rest of them ignored" is an Earned Stasis earned by prior causality, with the cost of defying the recall company legible. Jory is a functional secondary pressure source, but his characterization is slightly thinner, serving more as a catalyst.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal (Mara’s investigative method creates because/therefore linkages). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the final line reweights "listen for paths" from literal navigation to a metaphor for human attention, with cost felt in Mara's defiance and the offered protocol. Orientation is immediate; pattern is taught early and holds. The persistent constraint of the recall teams shapes tactics (hiding photos) and charges the final stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The light painting studio and muscovite sliver are micro-settings that crucially constrain choice and charge the final image. The sliver's "fractally precise" property directly enables the discovery. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("smelled of ozone," "clicked like an anxious tongue"), filtered through Mara’s professional perception. Spatial choreography in the test scene is clear and tactile.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (illuminating hidden pathways to help before memory erasure) escalates through Mara’s agency: she devises the test, deciphers the map, and follows it. The meaningful tightening is her decision to hide evidence and later share her protocol, which forecloses the option of compliance and risks confrontation. Cost is visible in the polite threats and the act of defiance, charging the final image of "willowglass hope."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (listening to embodied human signals over abstract belief) emerges entirely through action and image, culminating in the resonant, non-literal final line. The muscovite sliver and "willowglass hope" are recurring images that reweight meaning without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures (the hug) and the shift from proving telepathy to mapping somatic awareness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single, stable POV with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara’s "affectionate skeptic" voice blends technical observation ("somatic markers") with empathetic metaphor ("footsteps in rain"). Prose rhythm modulates effectively with pressure, tightening during the test, broadening in reflection. Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven (Jory’s plea, Mara’s refusal). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and propulsive, with high information density. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("willowglass hope"). A minor synonym loop ("belief in magic"/"belief that the recalled pills") occurs near a key beat but does not touch closure or obscure causality. Sentence-level rhythm is expertly controlled, varying to match investigative focus and thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of telepathy recall, somatic markers, and light painting photography is fresh, specific, and organic. The core concept is transformed through grounded, character-driven methodology rather than genre trope. Risk-taking in the lyric, conceptual closure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The story’s vision feels singular and authentically executed.</comment>
