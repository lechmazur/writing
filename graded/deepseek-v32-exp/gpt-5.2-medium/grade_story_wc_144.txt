<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lio is vividly rendered with embodied skill and consistent motivation, but the absence of internal contradiction or flawed struggle limits psychological depth, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal plot is taut; orientation is immediate; closure lands with decisive change and felt cost—the urgency of the ship's departure and repaired trust—under a coherent causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is immersive and functional; the fountain and light refraction are indispensable tools that constrain Lio's choices and charge the final image of guiding faith.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fix drone for voyage) escalates cleanly via time pressure; Lio's agency drives the resolution with visible cost in the trembling depot and spilled trust.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of decoding feedback into direction emerges through action; the final line—"treat every chirp as a question the sea is answering"—offers resonant, non-literal closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, filtered through Lio's non-visual senses; prose rhythm mirrors his magnetic calm without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is precise and evocative, with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of blind artisan, light refraction, and hummingbird drone feels inevitable; risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
