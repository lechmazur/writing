<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Orun's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot with credible micro-choices (e.g., using the ink pellet, sundering the star). His regal unpretentiousness is shown through his refusal of the crown, earning the final renunciation. However, interiority remains somewhat external, with limited contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly; closure is a decisive change (unmasking the pretender) with visible cost (library collapse, refusal of crown). Orientation is immediate, and the two-shard structure (library then throne hall) transitions cleanly. The rune of drift serves as a persistent constraint that shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The temple library is a richly textured, atmospheric setting that actively constrains and enables choices (e.g., the rune of drift navigation, the mosaic door). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Orun's archival expertise, and the environment charges the final image of graceful collapse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unmasking the pretender) escalates through Orun's agency under the causal lens: each clue narrows options, culminating in the irreversible act of sundering the star. Cost is legible in the library's collapse and Orun's forfeiture of power, tightening the stakes meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of truth, memory, and humility emerge organically from Orun's quest and his final renunciation. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"some truths must be left as cryptic messages for the next age"—without moralizing, reweighting the narrative's core question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, archive-filtered perceptual signature. Voice modulates effectively from hushed discovery to decisive action. No head-hopping; the brief dialogue at the end serves functional, character-revealing ends.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density, yet maintains clarity and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("dust fell in slow arcs like collapsed prayers") is consistent and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; sentences propel the story forward.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of archivist-as-hero, magical library, and political intrigue feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices (e.g., the rune of drift, iron gall ink as magical medium). The resolution avoids cliché, embracing a quiet, humble victory.</comment>
