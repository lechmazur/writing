<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete and particular, from her “sanely eccentric precision” to her loneliness as a “closed system”; her motivation to find where stories live drives measured choices that culminate in an earned reconfiguration—guiding patrons—with visible cost in the exchange of her solitude.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate, accumulative lens holds firmly; closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the realization that stories are “relations” and her role as guide—with cost legible in the line “her own loneliness had been a kind of closed system waiting for exchange.” Geometry constrains tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the scientific poetry library with hyperbolic geometry actively constrains Mara’s discovery; the scarf and hidden pocket charge the final image. Sensory details (river water, coal smoke) are selective, purposeful, and filtered through her POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding where stories live) escalates via Mara’s agency under the accumulative lens—measuring angles, pressing the shelf—culminating in a choice that forecloses her isolation with a felt cost: loneliness exchanged for connection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: memory as material, stories as relations. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mara’s guiding role and the logbook entry, reweighting prior imagery without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct; voice has a poetic, precise perceptual signature (“humming under her breath as if each book had a pulse”). No head‑hopping; elision (e.g., hyperbolic geometry) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“the grain shifted under her skin like a living proof”) is clear and purposeful; momentum never falters.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of scientific poetry, hyperbolic geometry, and analog memory feels inevitable; risk‑taking in lyric accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise is transformed through specific, lived detail.</comment>
