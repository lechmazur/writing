<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior conflict between connection and fear is embodied in micro-choices; final confession earns its cost through prior causality and the withheld letter. No diagnostic label-speak; the relationship with Arin acts as a crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate; closure is a decisive change (confession and rejoining) with felt cost on the page ("I felt the thread...finally held"). No causality breaks; the Arin encounter is motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (temple, pond, installation) is vividly filtered through POV and actively constrains choice—the thrush's nest object charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (connection vs. secrecy) escalates via protagonist agency; the Arin confrontation forces a tightening that forecloses secrecy with visible cost. Escalation is driven by causal choices, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of connection/secrecy emerges through concrete images (thread, spiral, ribbons) and subtext; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The withheld letter and public confession create layered meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (poetic, professional); voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and elision (the secret) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with varied rhythm and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clarity is maintained even in peak beats; no artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghostwriter, public art, and personal secret feels inevitable; risk-taking with lyric voice heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
