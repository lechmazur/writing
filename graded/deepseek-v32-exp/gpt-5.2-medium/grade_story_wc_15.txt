<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ila's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her optimistic perseverance and weaving worldview. Her micro-choices under pressure—gathering the community, proposing sleepwalking, stitching the thread—advance the plot and reveal her values. However, the interiority is sometimes filtered through poetic summary rather than contradictory impulses in scene, which limits the emotional granularity needed for the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing: reverence redefined as an actively sewn path, with cost legible in the labor of stitching and the community's transformation. The hybrid lens (causal and accumulative) holds, and the plate's recurrence as a window charges the final image. Orientation is immediate, and causality is tight throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the labyrinth pressures choices, the plate and thread constrain tactics, and the orchid-scented atmosphere charges the final image. Sensory details are vivid, selective, and filtered through Ila's weaver perspective, seamlessly integrated with action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ruin vs. reverence) escalates through Ila's agency: her sleepwalking method and stitching progressively narrow options and deepen understanding, culminating in the altar discovery and community transformation. Cost is visible in the physical and emotional labor of the participants.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete actions and images—weaving, sleepwalking, stitching—culminating in a resonant, non-literal insight: "reverence is not a rule you obey, but a path you keep sewing back into being." No moralizing; the conceptual repricing is earned through specific particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: poetic, rhythmic, and consistently filtered through Ila's weaver sensibility. POV is stable third-person limited, with no head-hopping. The lyrical compression is pattern-taught and pays off at closure, enhancing the mystical tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly polished, with varied syntax and strong rhythmic control. Information density is high; figurative language is consistent and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts that obscure causality or dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality is exceptional: a fresh synthesis of weaving, sleepwalking, and labyrinth mythology that feels inevitable in hindsight. The poetic voice and conceptual risk-taking heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The story transforms its premise through specific, grounded detail.</comment>
