<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lysa's gravity-defying ability and fear of commitment are concrete, contradictory impulses that drive micro-choices under pressure; her final choice to "let gravity have her" is earned by the timeline confrontations, with visible cost in "she rose heavier." No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summary disrupts the embodied interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly; orientation is immediate. Closure is a decisive change (choosing a timeline, strands folding) with legible cost ("heavier than before"). The tablet's rule-set is taught early and pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The glowing viaduct and warm clay tablet are vivid, sensorily rich, and actively constrain choice—the bridge enables floating, the tablet generates the maze. The final image of the viaduct brightening then darkening charges the closure with atmospheric cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (conquering self-labyrinth) signals early; escalation occurs through accumulated timeline fractures and the protagonist’s active testing. Agency drives the climax—her choice to stay and ask for help—with unmistakable cost in her newfound weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of self-avoidance emerges through concrete images (fractured timelines, procedural labyrinth) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the tablet as proof of an exit, reweighting prior material through the final charged image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, speculative perceptual signature. Rhythmic control under pressure is precise; purposeful elision (the tablet’s mechanics) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmically varied, and free of loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("darkening brightness") is consistent and heightens clarity. Every sentence advances character or atmosphere; no artifact obscures the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravity-defier, procedural-generation maze, and ancient tablet feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical, speculative style heightens stakes without gimmickry; the core concept is fully committed and integrated with character arc.</comment>
