<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Liora's interiority is concrete and her motivation—trust in work over miracles—compels higher-stakes choices under pressure, like her decision to stay and rebuild. The final renunciation of arrival-based faith is earned by prior causality (the tremor, the notebook discovery). Minor deduction for moments where emotional embodiment leans toward summary rather than immediate, contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise) where Liora's decision to keep moving reweights the premise. Cost is legible on the page in the final sundial image and her choice not to leave. The notebook discovery is slightly convenient but integrated within the taught pattern of interruption and record.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is a micro-setting that actively constrains choice (roots as map, clay as mortar) and decisively charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through Liora's professional and curious POV. The environment shapes tactics and the closure's meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure deepens through the tremor and the discovery of the stopped watch and notebook, reweighting the dominant stake of restoring faith. Liora's agency in rebuilding and deciding to stay forecloses the path of departure with visible cost. Escalation is driven by her choices and the setting's constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of faith through detours emerges organically from particulars (sundial, notebook, interrupted journeys) without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the moving shadow and Liora's decision, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates powerfully in image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature (lyrical, archaeologically observant). Syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional intensity, maintaining control under pressure. No head-hopping; any elision (e.g., of specific years) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, vivid, and propelled by varied syntax and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("roots tightening as though to brace the roof") is consistent and purposeful. A slight tendency toward ornate metaphor in quieter moments prevents a 9+ score, but no loops, scaffolds, or clarity breaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of archaeological excavation, interrupted journeys, and faith restoration feels fresh and inevitable. Specific, grounded choices (catacomb orchard, sundial, notebook) transform potential tropes. Risk-taking in lyrical density heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure image is singular.</comment>
