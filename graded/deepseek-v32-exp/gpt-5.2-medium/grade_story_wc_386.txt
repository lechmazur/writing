<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to salvage purity is concrete and drives every choice, from recovering the globe to exposing Fen. Her interiority is specific and embodied, with micro-choices like warming the globe and aligning distortions showing her methodical nature under pressure. The final act of placing the globe as a gentler window is an earned renunciation that forecloses a path with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions are shown through her careful truth-weaving versus the ghost's urgency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: the melted globe triggers investigation, the shrine’s ice lens enables discovery, and Mara’s trap leads to Fen’s capture. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—the globe, now a “gentler window,” reconfigures the shrine’s purpose and quiets the ghost. Orientation is immediate and clear. No plot amnesia or convenient resolutions; each beat narrows options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The glacier shrine is vividly specific and functions as a crucial tool—the ice lens is a “window of connection” that Mara uses to uncover Fen’s method. Sensory details (candle-lit ice, starlight tinting flames) are filtered through Mara’s professional perception and directly constrain choice. The setting charges the final image, where the alcove holds the melted globe “where the light could reach it.”</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (exposing Fen and salvaging purity) is signaled early and escalates through Mara’s agency: she uses the globe and shrine to gather evidence, then orchestrates a shared-dream trap. The confrontation on the pier is a meaningful tightening that forecloses Fen’s operation. Cost is legible in the melted globe’s permanent transformation and the ghost’s quiet gratitude.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central image: purity as something “rescued and held where the light could reach it.” The melted snow globe becomes a resonant symbol of damaged yet repurposed memory, resisting commodification. Subtext operates through the ghosts’ pressed images and Fen’s exploitation. No moralizing; the ending offers a non-literal answer through the final gesture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly bound to Mara’s perception, with a distinct lyrical texture that modulates under pressure (“aligning distortions the way she aligned testimonies”). POV modesty is maintained—Mara infers but only translates what she can confirm. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven (fisherwoman, priest). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Sentences vary rhythmically, advancing character and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; even high-pressure beats like the vision through the ice lens are crisp. The final image lands with concrete specificity, recharging earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of wreck-diving, ghost-whispering, and dream-harvesting feels organic and inevitable. The concept of “windows of connection” is fully integrated into plot and theme. Specific details (melted snow globe, ice lens, borrowed starlight) are irreplaceable and charge the closure. No derivative templates; emotional truth anchors the fantastical elements.</comment>
