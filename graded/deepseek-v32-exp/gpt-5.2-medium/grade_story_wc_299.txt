<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Protagonist's interior contradiction (facts as earplugs vs. longing for meaning) is concrete and embodied in micro-choices like the burn test and overnight request. Relationship with Marla acts as a crucible, forcing a stance crystallization. Final renunciation of proving himself right for connecting memory is earned by prior causality. Slight risk of over-articulated epiphany ("purpose was not applause...") but anchored in concrete action and cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clear Causal lens: public failure motivates eastward drive; cloth discovery triggers memory, leading to report and shared recognition. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (purpose redefined as handing proof memory is real) with visible cost in Marla's confession and the reconfigured final image. Orientation is immediate; pattern taught and held. One meaningful tightening from insulation to connection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is essential: quarry office trailer's "thin walls humming" and "scar of stone" mirror emotional emptiness. The speaker grille cloth functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice (measuring, burn test) and decisively charges the final image and realization. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (professional appraisal details, sound memories).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding purpose after public loss) escalates through protagonist's agency: examining cloth, remembering concert, drafting report, proposing listening station. Tightening is driven by his choices under causal lens, culminating in a trade-off (shedding defensive jargon for honest connection). Cost is legible in Marla's personal revelation and the valley "holding our voices."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (purpose after applause, memory vs. facts) emerges through particulars—the cloth, the burn test, the quarry echo. Final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in Marla's shrugged admission about her brother. Thematic echo is avoided; wisdom earned through specific struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: roadie/appraiser lexicon, sound-focused perception ("ears filled with silence," "after-applause hush"). Voice modulates with emotional pressure without register drift. Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven (Marla's lines reveal character and pressure). No head-hopping; elision is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density. Sentences vary rhythmically, accelerating in reflective beats ("The more I stared...") and landing with concrete images. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Final paragraph achieves clarity and resonance without overwriting. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthesis of roadie past, appraisal failure, and acoustic archaeology feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept ("after the applause") is transformed through specific, grounded details (circuit board humiliation, quarry echoes). Emotional specificity avoids template plots. Risk-taking in quiet, conceptual closure pays off.</comment>
