<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elias's characterization is concrete and contradictory; his wisely pragmatic nature and shame over past deceit drive micro-choices like polishing marbles and confessing to the hedges. The final alignment—admitting fraud and seeing his luck score climb—is earned by prior causality with visible cost in his physical effort and emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Elias admits his deception and performs his ritual, his luck score rises. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in "his luck score climbed" and the final image of leaving a marble under the oldest vine. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The garden maze and cracked marbles function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details—lanterns like a slow constellation, scents of rosemary and rot—are filtered through Elias's POV and integrate with action, mirroring the theme of blooming and withering.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving gardens know their gardeners) escalates via Elias's agency: he requests the night, performs the ritual, and confesses aloud. The tightening forecloses his shame and forces a trade-off, with cost unmistakable in his breath and pulse aligning and the physical toll of polishing until his thumb ached.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: measured luck versus human ritual, deception versus authenticity. Subtext operates in gestures like polishing marbles and the spiral pattern. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"proof had to be tended like any garden"—that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct; voice blends lyrical precision with pragmatic wisdom, mirroring Elias's character. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (Mera's curiosity). Perceptual signature is selective, e.g., marbles' fractures catching the sun like spider silk, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language is purposeful and clear (e.g., "like a slow constellation"). No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts that obscure closure; sentence-level control supports pressure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise—measurable luck, a vine dresser's marble-led rituals—is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Tropes are transformed through specific details like cracked marbles and luck meters. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
