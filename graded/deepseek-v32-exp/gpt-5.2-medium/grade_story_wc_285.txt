<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rowan's grief and attentiveness are embodied through concrete actions like using the yarn needle; his final choice to drive Senn is earned by prior causality with visible cost when he feels the letters pull at his ribs and his anger percolates down.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with Mara's return and Senn's repentance; causal lens holds tightly from deciphering to crossing; cost is legible in Rowan wrapping his coat and scratching the vellum, and the ticking gutters provide a persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fog-bound crossing and yarn needle constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details like lamp halos and spindrift serenity are filtered through Rowan's POV, integrating setting with pressure and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Rowan's agency in tracing the palimpsest and demanding truth; cost is unmistakable in Senn's confession and Mara's return, tightening under causal pressure until the gutters still.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of promises as palimpsests emerges through action and image, culminating in the non-literal realization that they are "clarified, not erased"; subtext operates in gestures like the needle tracing, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—Rowan's attention to ambient details like wet boots and salt-stiff sleeves; lyrical prose rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; figurative language like "spindrift serenity" is consistent and purposeful, no loops or scaffolds obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Palimpsest promise concept is fresh and synthesized into character-driven stakes; specific details like the yarn needle and ticking gutters transform tropes with emotional truth, earning turns and closure.</comment>
