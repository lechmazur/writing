<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lina's motivation is clear and rooted in her resilient positivity; her interiority is concrete, and her final choice to merge timelines is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the permanent transient ache. Contradictory impulses (fear vs. resilience) act in scene, and the workman's nod at closure confirms a credible endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost (the ache and ongoing work). Orientation is immediate, and the mosaic structure (ferry, hourglass, grotto) coheres with legible transitions. The hourglass as persistent constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting (ferry, grotto, sideways clocks) is vivid and selective, constraining choices and charging the final image. The grotto's "blue salt light" and the fading to ordinary rock reweight the stake with concrete sensory detail filtered through Lina's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (merging timelines to prevent alone disappearance) escalates through Lina's agency: tracing patterns, radio code. Cost is legible in her fear and the ache of goodbyes. One meaningful tightening (the code transmission) forecloses other options under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of transience and interconnection emerges through images (hourglass lines, permanent transient) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the merged ferries and the nod, reweighting prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical yet precise ("time preferred to crab along the wharf"). Rhythm modulates with pressure, and any elision (e.g., echo sounds) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear (e.g., "engines sounded as if they were turning pages"), and sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of parallel timelines via ferry and hourglass feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking (sideways clocks, spectral grotto) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
