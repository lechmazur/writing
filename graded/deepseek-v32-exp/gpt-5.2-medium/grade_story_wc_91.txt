<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Amina's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with micro-choices under pressure revealing her hierarchy of values. The final realization is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction is subtle. The relationship with Toma shifts from suspicion to wonder, serving as a crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orientation is clear within 120 words; accumulative/textural lens holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost (the eruption and survival). Prophecy and coincidence are integrated without breaking causality, and the final image reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and actively constrains choices—the volcano’s eruption pressures escape, the cave’s glittering walls mirror the bugs’ rhythm. The black sand beach and celestial bodies charge the final image with transformative heat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding transformation) escalates to physical survival; agency is shown in the detour and lantern lift. Cost is legible in the eruption’s danger and the shared aftermath. Tightening under the accumulative lens is meaningful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images (volcano, bugs, hush) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: “change was hot, granular, and shared.” Subtext in prophecy and coincidence deepens complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical, consistent third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (listening for the hush). Voice remains stable under pressure; sparse dialogue is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished, dense, and rhythmic with varied syntax. Figurative language is purposeful and clear (“soft equations on the glass”). No loops, scaffold, or artifacts that obscure closure; high information density throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of destitute philanthropist, orchestrated coincidences, and volcanic transformation. Speculative elements (two moons, whispering hush) feel organic and specific. Risk-taking in mystical realism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
