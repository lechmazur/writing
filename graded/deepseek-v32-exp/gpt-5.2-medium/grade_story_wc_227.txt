<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lysa's interior contradiction (control vs. surrender) acts in scene; her final forgiveness and repair are earned by prior causality with visible cost in embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orientation anchored early; accumulative/textural lens holds; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise) with felt cost in the final image of keys clinking with gears, and the statue's constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting (acid sea, workshop, statue) pressures choices and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through POV, with the statue as micro-setting constraining action and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survival/meaning) escalates under accumulative lens via memory quilting that deepens knowledge; agency-driven tightening leads to golden repairs with cost legible in the turning of failures into anchors.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (repair, acceptance) emerges from concrete particulars like kintsugi and memory matching; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the image of floating with cracks.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and character-specific, with rhythmic control under pressure and purposeful compression that pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion; figurative language is pattern-taught and serves voice; no loops, scaffold, or artifact issues that obscure causality or dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of acid-sea alchemy, memory quilting, and kintsugi feels organic and inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and transformation of tropes is grounded in character.</comment>
