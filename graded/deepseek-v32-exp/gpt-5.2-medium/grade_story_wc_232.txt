<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara's loneliness and empirical intuition are concretely embodied; her final choice to leave Ellis and the presswork is earned by prior causality with visible cost, foreclosing a path with felt independence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal linkage holds tightly; closure lands on-page with Mara's decisive change, and the rising creek as persistent constraint shapes tactics; cost is legible in her relinquishment of the note and inheritance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting from shop to cavern is vivid and selective; the rising creek and cavern environment pressure choices and charge the final image with wet passage and ants.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Mara's search for her own destination—escalates through environmental pressure and meeting Ellis; her agency drives the choice, with cost visible in foregone inheritance and debts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of choice and promise emerges through imagery and action; ending reweights prior material without moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer in the moment of stepping through.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature reflecting Mara's empirical mind; voice modulates with pressure, and dialogue is natural and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and no artifacts; figurative language is controlled and serves clarity, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of maps, coordinates, and presswork feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet, introspective closure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
