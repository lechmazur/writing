<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and deeply personal, with micro-choices under pressure leading to an earned final act of deception and guidance; interiority is concrete, and her flaw—curiosity tied to her mother—drives inevitable mistakes without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal linkages are tight from inciting incident to climax; closure lands with cost as Mara lies and seeds the message, reconfiguring her role from keeper to activist; orientation is immediate, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The archive and Chute are vividly rendered, constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details like "servers hum like a choir" are filtered through Mara's professional perception, with the patch object essential to the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mara's agency, from curiosity to corporate conspiracy; cost is legible in her lies and risk, with the final choice foreclosing her compliance path under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of memory, silence, and corporate cover-up emerge through particulars like the numbers and patch; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, with subtext in audio messages and coordinates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm and diction reflect Mara's attentive, poetic observation without head-hopping, and dialogue is minimal but natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentences are dense and propel momentum; figurative language is purposeful and consistent, with no loops or artifacts obscuring clarity; read-aloud rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of corporate archiving, space mystery, and personal quest feels fresh and inevitable; specific details transform tropes into a singular vision with risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
