<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Noah's reticent yet observant nature is concretely embodied and drives his choice to join the anonymous chain; his internal conflict between silence and protection is resolved with visible cost (bleeding fingers, sore chest), earning the final renunciation/participation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds tightly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the restored light and continued chain "hold, a bottled safety warming in the dark," with cost legible in physical exertion and emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lantern room, sea glass, and cairns function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory details ("throat refusing to sing," "fog silver") are filtered through Noah's professional perception, deepening atmosphere without ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safety of ships) escalates through Noah's agency under Accumulative pressure; the letter and cairn system force a tactical trade-off with on-page cost (fingers "bled salt and grit"), tightening options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of anonymous watchfulness emerges through particulars (letter chain, sea glass, cairns) without statement; the ending reweights prior material via the image of "bottled safety" and the chain holding, offering resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Noah's "warmly observant" habit; prose rhythm modulates with pressure, and purposeful elision (the letter's content) pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional: sentences are dense and propulsive without loops or scaffold; figurative language ("like a throat refusing to sing") is precise and voice-motivated, heightening closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse isolation, anonymous letter chain, and cairn-code communication feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in quiet, accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, fully committed to its vision.</comment>
