<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sable's exile, precision, and desire for beauty drive all choices with embodied interiority; his final renunciation is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in the quiet beauty over the difficult choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate; closure lands with a decisive change (council renounces nexus) and felt cost, shaped by Sable's exile as a persistent constraint that validates the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus actively constrains choice: iron dust responds to chess pieces, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Sable's professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake escalates through Sable's agency: correlating movements, translating silence, proposing renunciation. Cost is legible in the narrow vote and his enduring exile, tightening options under time pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of restraint vs. power emerges organically from Sable's refusal and the covenant's betrayal; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of quiet beauty without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a lyrical, precise voice reflecting Sable's chess-tutor mindset; dialogue with Elder Mera is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, accelerating with scene needs without obscuring clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of chess, magnetism, and covenant feels fresh and inevitable; tropes are transformed through specific character choices and world logic, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
