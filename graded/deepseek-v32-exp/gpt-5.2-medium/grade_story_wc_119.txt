<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lian's interior contradiction (prophet vs. composer) is dramatized in scene; her final choice to burn fortunes and write openly is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Micro-choices under pressure (changing the lens, leading the courier) reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Decisive Change (burning fortunes, writing uncoded message) with felt cost; causal lens holds tightly via because/therefore linkages; orientation is immediate; persistent constraint (lighthouse beam) shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting (lighthouse, island, kitchen) actively pressures choices and supplies resources; the Fresnel lens and rock-face groove constrain action; sensory detail is selective and vivid, charging the final image with the "honest smell of salt."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (control one's narrative) escalates through protagonist agency under causal lens: patrol boat arrival forces Lian to change the beam and burn fortunes. Cost is legible in the destruction of old fortunes and the redirected searchlights.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (open secrets, self-authorship) emerges through particulars; the final line offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and silence (the burned strips).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and syntax reflect Lian's poetic, precise mind; dialogue is minimal but natural; no head-hopping; purposeful compression is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or scaffold; figurative language ("like a single white tooth") is controlled and purposeful; sentence propulsion accelerates with pressure without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fortune-cookie prophecy, spycraft, and lighthouse control feels inevitable; risk-taking in poetic compression heightens stakes; the concept of open secrets is transformed through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
