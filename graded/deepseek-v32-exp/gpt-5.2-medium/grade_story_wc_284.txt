<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rina’s motivation is clear and complex, rooted in past failure and a desire to repair. Interiority is concrete (pillbox warming, fear of erasure), and micro-choices under pressure (snow codes, using solder) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final choice—leaving the pillbox as a vow—is earned by prior causality with visible cost (burns, memory of betrayal). Minor deduction for a slightly extended backstory block, but it is anchored and tilts present stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: because/therefore linkages drive from Rina’s return through code-making, reunion, repair, and transmission. Closure is a Decisive Change (relay fixed, warning sent, courage risen) with felt cost (pillbox left as vow, burns remembered). Orientation is immediate; all three gates (setup, development, payoff) are satisfied. Persistent constraint (enemy monitoring) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (Zephyr Bluff, mist, sea) is vivid and selective, actively pressuring choices: snow carries codes, sea wind masks frequency, tide cave hides Elsi. The pillbox functions as micro-setting, constraining repair and charging the final image. Sensory details are POV-filtered and purposeful (silver hush, accumulated snow). Spatial choreography is clear and coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fix the broken relay to save villages) is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: making codes, mending radio, tuning frequency. One meaningful tightening (enemy patrols necessitate misdirection) forecloses options and raises cost. The cost is legible on the page (Rina’s burns, risk of capture). Resolution is earned and alters tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (betrayal and mending, courage in failure) emerges organically from concrete particulars—the pillbox’s transformation, snow codes, solder and salt. Subtext operates in gesture and image (pillbox as confession and kit). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing: the pillbox left as a vow reweights prior material. No thematic echo or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, precise perceptual signature (“silver hush,” “scorched name”). Voice modulates under pressure but remains consistent. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven. No head‑hopping; elision (backstory) is anchored and paid off. Diction and rhythm control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences vary rhythmically, accelerating and breathing with scene needs. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (mist like breath over a mirror). Final lines are clean and resonant. Zero artifacts that obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of the burned‑spy trope through a focus on repair and unused courage. The pillbox’s transformation from cyanide carrier to repair kit is specific and indispensable. Emotional truth is grounded in lived detail. Risk‑taking (quiet, reflective tone) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
