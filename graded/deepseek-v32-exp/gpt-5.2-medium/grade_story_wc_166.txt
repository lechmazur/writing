<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her identity as a tide dancer; her choice to keep the speck under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values. Interiority is concrete and embodied (panic flaring, dancer sense noticing rhythm). The final decision to fledge onward is earned by prior causality, though the internal conflict during the bargain could be more deeply contradictory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with legible cost (anchored time and effort, commitment to network). Causal lens holds tightly: anchoring leads to bargain, verse, release. Orientation is immediate; persistent constraint (anchoring) shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral to the plot: the twilight garden's fountains, stars, and bench constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's professional perception (brine language, tide rhythm).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (indelible art vs. censorship) escalates through the anchoring and the keeper's bargain, driven by Mira's agency. Cost is legible (confinement, focused effort), though the physical cost is light. One meaningful tightening (the bargain choice) narrows options and deepens the mission.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting longing into resistant art emerges through concrete action and image, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the network of inscribed bodies. Subtext operates in gestures (seated dance, dissolving speck) and the final heron image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature (tide dancer's attention to gaps, currents, rhythm). Voice is consistently poetic and controlled, modulating with pressure. The keeper's dialogue is natural and serves the bargain beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and artifact-free, with high information density and no scaffolding loops. Figurative language ("glittered like a trapped tide") is purposeful and coherent. Sentence-level propulsion varies with scene needs, accelerating in dance beats and breathing in reflection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of nostalgia ban, tide dancing, cosmic tattooing, and elective exile feels organic and inevitable. The concept is fully committed, with specific, irreplaceable details (moonstone speck, brine fountains). Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
