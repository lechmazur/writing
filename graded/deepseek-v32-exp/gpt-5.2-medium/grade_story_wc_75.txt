<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maris's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "stomach twist with a sweet dread"). Her final choice to lead the refugees and thaw the ice door is earned by prior causality, and micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with cost: "arts had been thawed back into breath" reconfigures meaning under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and causality holds from inciting incident to resolution. Persistent constraint (Council's eviction) shapes tactics, and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (grotto city, waterfall) pressures choices and supplies resources (ice door, kiln). Sensory details are vivid and selective (smells of wet stone, rosewater). Recurring objects (opera glass, bread) constrain choices and charge the final image, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving art and refugees) escalates through Maris's agency under a causal lens. Cost is legible in efforts like baking bread and risking discovery. One meaningful tightening (eviction notice) forces a trade-off, and the climax reweights options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (memory, tradition, resistance) emerges organically from events and images without direct statement. Subtext operates in gestures like bread baking. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of thawed arts, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (historically oriented mind). Voice is lyrical and consistent ("rosewater dread"). No head-hopping; diction and syntax reflect character's perspective under pressure, and any elision is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (e.g., "sweet dread, like rose syrup turned sour"). Minor ornamental risk in peak beats does not harm clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (grotto city, opera glass, bread baking) feels fresh and specific. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, and risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth anchors the premise.</comment>
