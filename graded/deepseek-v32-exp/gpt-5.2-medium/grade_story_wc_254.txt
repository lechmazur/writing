<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies through embodied interiority; her final choice to transcend boundaries is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure lands with Conceptual Repricing as Lira becomes air, reweighting boundaries with felt cost; orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful; the quartz colonnade constrains choice and charges the final image, with sensory detail filtered through Lira's poetic POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early; escalation is driven by Lira's paraphrasing under accumulative pressure, leading to a cost-legible transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars without moralizing; subtext in paraphrasing and boundaries offers a resonant, non-literal answer at closure.</comment>
