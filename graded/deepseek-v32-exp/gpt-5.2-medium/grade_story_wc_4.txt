<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative through micro-choices like taping photos. Her calm perceptiveness is embodied and enables community healing, but lacks contradictory impulses in scene, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with mosaic shards taught early; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (collective healing) with felt cost in the final image of the field breathing. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (lavender field, factory ruins) is vividly sensory and constrains choice—the fence and photos charge the final collage. Details are selective and integrated into action, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (healing) escalates under Accumulative lens via density of community participation; Mara's agency drives tightening, with cost legible in emotional labor during the storm scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of collective healing emerges organically from images and actions; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the walk-through collage without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature ("metallic taste") and rhythmic control under pressure, no head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density, varied syntax, and purposeful figurative language. No loops or scaffold; closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh premise of puzzle archivist transforms tropes through specific details; synthesis feels inevitable with risk-taking in mosaic structure and emotional specificity.</comment>
