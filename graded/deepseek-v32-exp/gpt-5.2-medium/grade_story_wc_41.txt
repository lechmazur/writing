<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is concrete and her micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values; Orrin’s condition is integrated into the action, and the final recording choice is earned with visible cost. Interiority is specific and embodied, though Orrin’s precognitive forgetfulness verges on convenient trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the playback of layered voices and the final image of turning silence into future echoes. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices (fog rearranges paths) and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through Mira’s perception, with the garden and videotapes shaping the entire narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing the sound of aging) escalates through the search and the intimate recording of Orrin’s rasp; cost is legible in Mira’s trembling and the act of preserving against the hush. Agency drives the tightening under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and loss emerges organically from images and actions; subtext operates through silence, echoes, and forgetting. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the archive and the final echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third‑person limited to Mira is stable and lyrical; perceptual signature is distinct, with rhythmic control and purposeful elision. No head‑hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural, and the voice remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and clear, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; rhythm supports mood, and the final lines are powerful without obscuring causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing elements into an organic whole; emotional truth avoids cliché. Risk‑taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
