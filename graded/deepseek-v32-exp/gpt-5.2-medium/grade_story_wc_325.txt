<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara's claustrophobia and determination create compelling interior contradiction; micro-choices under pressure, like counting exhalations, earn the final repair with visible cost in her shaking and the softened surf.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal linkages tighten from tidal window to phase transition to cable repair; orientation is immediate; closure lands with cost as the terminal wakes and surf softens, under a consistent causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details—wet copper smell, rusted consoles—constrain choice and charge the final image; the cave and gold fleck are integral to tactics, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (brother, coast link) escalate via Mara's agency; the phase transition and repair are key turns with cost legible in her shaking and the changed surf, driving escalation under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and connection emerges through the cable's silence and Ken's log; the final image reweights the crashing hush without moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable POV with distinct perceptual signature; voice blends poetic precision with professional lexicon, controlled under pressure without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spelunking, claustrophobia, and undersea cables; specific details like the gold fleck and phase transitions feel inevitable, with risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
