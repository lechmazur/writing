<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied ("chest felt like an unopened letter"), with contradictory impulses acting in scene; her final choice to release stored love is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost as the knot loosens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost (knot loosening, petals darkening); accumulative/textural lens holds throughout; orientation is anchored early and clean.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting (viaduct, camera, tear) constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, weaving atmosphere into action without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding unused love) escalates under accumulative lens through Mara's agency in breathing changes; cost is legible in the knot's release and petal transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("a current to join") that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; lyrical voice modulates with emotional pressure, and purposeful compression supports closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mystical elements (pilgrim of sparks, camera obscura) feels inevitable; risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and specificity anchors emotional truth.</comment>
