<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Narrator's ego death and clarity are concretely embodied; internal conflict drives micro-choices; final vivification earned through training and cost felt as numbness cracks. No weaknesses in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain tight from ego death to dojo to custody battle; closure lands with resonant reconfiguration—co-guardianship—and cost legible in "numbness crack"; orientation clear early, lens holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Floating dojo and ash-colored sea create vivid, pressuring environment; brain jar and dojo edge constrain choices and charge final image; sensory details selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes of personhood escalate from custody battle to trial on dojo edge; protagonist agency drives escalation via complementary opposites; cost visible in shared breath and cracked numbness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of balance and identity emerges through opposites, recharged in final image of co-guardians; no moralizing, earned through concrete actions; subtext in gestures like bowing to clone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV stable with distinct perceptual signature from post-ego-death clarity; voice lyrical and consistent; no head-hopping; dialogue minimal but natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose dense and rhythmic, metaphors integrated ("blade parts fog"); no loops or artifacts; high information density without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ego death, floating dojo, clone custody; tropes transformed through specific choices; risk-taking in concept and structure pays off with inevitable closure.</comment>
