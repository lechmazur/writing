<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyra's lyrical code-breaking and calm defiance are concretely embodied in micro-choices under pressure; motivation to encrypt vulnerability as strength drives the plot, though internal contradiction is subtle for this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change and conceptual cost; causal lens holds tightly from goal to liberation, with the pod-tampering constraint shaping tactics; orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sunken laboratory pressures choices with vivid sensory detail; hangman's dice and spider web function as micro-settings that constrain actions and charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of liberation escalates via guardian's surveillance and Lyra's agency; cost is legible in the journal left behind and the risk of detection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability encrypted as strength emerges from coded dance and journal entries; ending reweights prior material without moralizing, offering resonant subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with lyrical perceptual signature; voice is distinct and rhythmic, dialogue minimal but natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without loops or artifacts; figurative language like the spider web metaphor is patterned and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of code-breaking, dance, and sunken lab feels organic; unique methods heighten stakes and coherence, with risk-taking that enhances closure.</comment>
