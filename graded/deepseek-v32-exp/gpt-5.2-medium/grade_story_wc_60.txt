<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interior contradiction (skepticism vs. luminous imagination) is embodied in concrete micro-choices; her final decision to return memories is earned by prior causality and personal loss, with visible cost in the ache of remembering and the revelation about her mother.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a decisive change (box opens, truth revealed) with felt cost in Mara's defiant hush to let the city remember. Orientation is immediate and clear; the puzzle's solution arises from established traits and clues.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is integral and constrains choice: the city of forgotten fountains supplies limescale crumbs and the underground hall; the stained glass box and pedestal charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberating trapped memories) escalates through Mara's agency under causal pressure; cost is legible in the emotional ache of remembering and the personal revelation. One meaningful tightening (realizing "unstick" requires release) forecloses options and forces a trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (memory, loss, the cost of truth) emerges organically from events and images; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mara's determination to remember even if it aches, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; voice has a distinct lyrical precision that matches the setting and Mara's perceptual signature. No head-hopping; rhythmic control under pressure supports the closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Minor hairline slip in the unusual phrase "sidereal patience" is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elements (luminous skeptic, forgotten fountains, stained glass box) feels organic and inevitable; risk-taking in poetic voice heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
