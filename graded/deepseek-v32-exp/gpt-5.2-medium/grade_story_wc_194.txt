<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Characterization is strong with clear motivation and embodied emotion; Leander's internal conflict between ending the dynasty and seeking restitution is shown through actions, and his final abdication is earned by discovery with visible cost. No major flaws, though deeper internal contradiction could enhance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with clear orientation and logical progression; closure lands with a decisive change (abdication and bridge order) and legible cost. The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and persistent constraint of hidden truth shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly described and integral; the sepia reading room and gramophone constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, with the object-as-setting actively shaping discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are established early and escalate through Leander's agency; the discovery of truth forces a costly decision, tightening options under causal pressure. Cost is visible in abdication, but escalation is slightly linear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through quest for truth and restitution; the ending image of building the bridge offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext is rich in silence and intuition, and the core concept is well-integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with a lyrical third-person limited POV; perceptual signature reflects Leander's scholarly perspective. No head-hopping, and prose rhythm supports pressure, with elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic without loops or scaffolds; figurative language is controlled, and information density is high. Sentence-level propulsion advances the story smoothly, with no artifacts obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Story combines elements with originality, transforming tropes through specific details; the gramophone mechanism and bridge metaphor feel fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking enhances stakes without obscuring clarity, offering a non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
