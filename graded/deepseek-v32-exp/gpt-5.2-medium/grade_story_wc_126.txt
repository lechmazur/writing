<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara's acoustic perception and motivation are concrete and drive her choices; her final stance is earned by prior causality. Slight deduction for cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt, but interiority remains embodied and specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (the hush undone) with a resonant reconfiguration of beauty in the unfinished; causal/accumulative hybrid lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and essential—the greenhouse and cistern constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's perception, integrating fully with action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding beauty in the unfinished) escalates through Mara's agency; the unbinding is a meaningful tightening that forecloses the hush with a clear, on-page cost (release of sound and acceptance of incompleteness).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through image and action (mendicant's bowl, unfinished fruit, final laugh); the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material with conceptual richness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature shaped by Mara's acoustic sensitivity; voice remains consistent under pressure, and any elision (Jory's silence) serves the hush motif and closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold; figurative language is controlled and purposeful, and peak beats maintain clarity without muddle or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (chronic hush, acoustic perception, unbinding) feels inevitable; specific, grounded choices transform familiar tropes into a fresh, authentic vision with risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
