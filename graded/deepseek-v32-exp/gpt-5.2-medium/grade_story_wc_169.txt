<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mina's logical dreamer trait is shown through concrete actions (notebooks, experiments), and her motivation to find hope drives credible choices. Interiority is specific, though internal contradiction could be more dramatized in scene. Final communal action is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the town's "polite collapse."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from experiments to timeline discovery to canopy lift. Closure is a decisive change (ascent) with cost legible in the abandoned town and effort. Orientation is clear within 120 words; parallel timeline twist integrates without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tide-polished grotto and brass gauge are micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details ("sea breathe through stone," "tidewater glow") are selective and filtered through Mina's POV, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hope vs. despair) escalates through Mina's agency: experiments, timeline discovery, formula revision, and communal launch. Cost is visible in the town's collapse and her vigilant effort. One meaningful tightening (personal to communal) under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hope as computable, shared across timelines emerges through particulars (balloons, gauge, chalk marks) without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the canopy ascent, reweighting prior material with serene upheaval.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical precision fitting a logical dreamer. Voice modulates under pressure (e.g., "serene upheaval") without head-hopping. Minimal dialogue is natural and advances plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("calm lightning," "slow engine") is consistent and purposeful. Information density high; every line advances story or atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of trial balloons, parallel timelines, and computational hope feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without gimmickry; details are specific and irreplaceable (gauge, grotto, decorations).</comment>
