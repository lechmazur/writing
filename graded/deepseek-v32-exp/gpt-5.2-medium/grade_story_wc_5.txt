<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Eira's motivation and embodied patience are clear and consistent, driving her ritualistic actions. However, the story lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene, which prevents a higher score despite the earned closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost (sealed starlight, shared map). Orientation is immediate, and the ritual's causality leads inevitably to the aurora's movement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the crater's frozen soil, orchard, and well constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective, vivid, and fully integrated with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving a guiding pulse) escalate through Eira's deliberate ritual under the accumulative lens. Agency drives the sealing, with cost visible in her patient endurance and the bound starlight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Themes of patience, preserved light, and heartbeat navigation emerge through concrete action and the final shared map. Subtext resists moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable, voice lyrical and rhythmic, matching the ritual's pace. Perceptual signature is distinct, with no head-hopping; elision (silent dialogue) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, precise, and propulsive with zero loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("sketched in ash," "ladder of stars") is consistent and heightens atmosphere without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of alchemy, astronomy, and cartography feels inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet, ritualistic plot heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; premise is fully committed and transformative.</comment>
