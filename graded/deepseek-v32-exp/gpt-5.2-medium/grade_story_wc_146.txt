<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sava's cryptic motivation is consistent and drives all choices; his patience and sacrifice are embodied through micro-choices (walking until soles bleed). Mara's development from observer to participant adds credible secondary pressure. Slightly limited interior emotional depth keeps it from the highest band, but the final renunciation/endurance is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (town's revival via aligned rhythms) with undeniable cost (Sava's perseverance, collective effort). Orientation is immediate; pattern taught early and paid off at climax with the decree carrier folding his paper.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the archway as ear, street as throat actively constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through POV (listening harder than anyone breathed). Spatial choreography is coherent; the environment evolves causally with the rhythmic corrections.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (town's survival) signaled early. Escalation under accumulative lens via density of rhythmic patterns and growing followers. Agency is collective endurance; cost is legible in Sava's physical sacrifice and the town's aligned grief. One meaningful tightening (looming decree) forces the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of shared balance emerges organically from concrete actions and images, never stated. Subtext operates in silence and rhythm. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the town's revived sound, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited with a stable, lyrical voice consistent with the mystical tone. POV filters perception through Sava's auditory focus. Prose rhythm mirrors thematic patterns. Brief shift to Mara is clean and at a section break. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is distinct and controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and flawlessly propelled. Sentences vary rhythmically to support the accumulative build. High information density; figurative language is precise and purposeful ("swallowed sound and returned it as echo"). No artifacts, loops, or scaffold; clarity is maintained even at peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis: tuning a town through rhythm is a fresh, specific concept transformed through grounded detail. Risk-taking in style and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with authentic vision and no derivative echoes.</comment>
