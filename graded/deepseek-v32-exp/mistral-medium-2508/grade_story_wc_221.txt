<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in family history, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. Her final decision to step into the light is earned by prior causality, showing a credible endurance with visible cost. The "blessed pariah" trait drives her isolation and belief, intensifying under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lira steps into the light, redefining home as a direction with felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with orientation anchored early. The compass rose's warming and needle shift provide a decisive change that charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly described with sensory details like frost-bitten metal and cosmic dust, constraining choices (e.g., deck creaks, compass warms). The observation deck as micro-setting pressures Lira's actions and charges the closure when she aligns the sketch with stars.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (belief in true north vs. reality) escalates under accumulative lens through Lira's glimpse of light and decision to act. Agency is clear in her sketching and stepping off, with cost legible in her departure. One meaningful tightening forecloses her old life.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of home as a direction emerges organically from events and images, not statement, with subtext in the family custom and compass metaphor. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Lira's realization and action, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice and perceptual signature. Rhythm and syntax control heighten pressure, e.g., "the stars beyond seemed to stretch, warp." No head-hopping; elision (e.g., anomaly reveal) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts or loops. Figurative language is purposeful, e.g., "pulse like a dying star’s last sigh," and clarity is maintained in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing true north as a temporal direction, with tropes transformed through specific details. Risk-taking in structure (e.g., temporal stretching) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The closure feels inevitable from established pattern.</comment>
