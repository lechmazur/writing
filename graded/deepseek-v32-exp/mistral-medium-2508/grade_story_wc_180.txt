<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mender's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final renunciation (eating the apple) is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the wrist-tying of the ribbon. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost when the mender eats the apple and accepts the daughter's perspective. The hybrid drive lens (causal and accumulative) holds, with because/therefore linkages in the digging and discovery. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure is coherent for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices (e.g., digging in loam under cathedral ribs) and charging the final image with the ribbon and sprout. Sensory detail is vivid and selective, filtered through POV bias, with the orchard-cathedral fusion shaping tone and theme. Micro-setting elements like the trowel and seed alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the hybrid lens, from digging to planting the seed, forcing a stance crystallization. The dominant stake (understanding the daughter) tightens with the note's discovery, and cost is legible in the mender's trembling fingers and the eaten apple. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of deciduous vows and generational wisdom emerges through particulars like the ribbon and seed, with subtext in the daughter's note. The ending offers a non-literal answer through the sprout and eaten apple, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic yet character-specific, with elision (e.g., the contract details) taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction remains within the mender's lexicon, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("fruit so ripe it smelled like forgiveness") is purposeful and coherent, avoiding muddle. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the discovery, and clarity is maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of quartz-eye mender, cathedral orchard, and deciduous vows feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in the lyric structure. Core premise is transformed through specific details, and the final image reconfigures meaning without gimmickry. Emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
