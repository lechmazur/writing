<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Chronicler's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with embodied emotion under pressure; micro-choices like giving the cicada are earned by prior causality and foreclose a path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with cost legible when she gives the cicada; orientation is clear early, and persistent constraint (cicada) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details (damp stone, metallic tang) that constrain choice and charge the final image; grotto and cicada function as micro-setting that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency through her realization and decision to give the cicada; cost is unmistakable in the foreclosed path and the cicada's transfer.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of transitions emerges through particulars like the cicada and tidal pools; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; lyrical prose and rhythmic control under pressure; elision (e.g., cicada's sound) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats like the cicada's warmth.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (tidal pools, cicada, grotto) feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet, reflective style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
