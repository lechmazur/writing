<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's characterization is deeply rooted in his role and failures, with concrete interiority and embodied emotions. His micro-choices under pressure, such as playing the flute to widen the breach, reveal a hierarchy of values, and his final decision to follow is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost when Elias steps forward, reconfiguring his stance. The accumulative/textural drive lens holds, and orientation is clear early, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is integral, with the Thunder-Echo Range and driftwood markers constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's POV to mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the accumulative lens, such as playing the flute to widen the breach, narrowing options with cost legible when he crosses the threshold. The dominant stake of the weave's integrity tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of acceptance emerges through events and images, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gesture and silence, such as the child's laughter reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping, even under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, with no loops or scaffold obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The concept of weaving between worlds is transformed through specific, grounded choices, with risk-taking in the quiet narrative heightening stakes. The synthesis feels inevitable, and the closure reconfigures meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
