<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find unused love is clear and rooted in her traits, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. Her final choice to turn off the projector is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with felt cost in the silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in the silence and her smile. The accumulative/textural lens holds, and the persistent constraint of the film reels shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
