<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; embodied emotions (trembling fingers, bleeding hands) and micro-choices (tracing heat-map, playing piano) earn her final decision to play the storm. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with no stock phrasing. The resolution forecloses a path with visible cost, scaled to length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with cost as silence yields to song and she decides to raise the Capriccio; Hybrid lens (causal and accumulative) holds without contradiction. Orientation is clear early (~120 words). Persistent constraint of frozen sound shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image when winterglass sings; sensory details (cold glass, frost, dust) are selective and purposeful. Micro-setting (piano, case) alters tactics. Environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Liora's agency under Hybrid lens, from failed note to making glass sing; cost is legible in bleeding hands and burning heat-map. Dominant stake (overcoming silence) tightens through meaningful deepening that reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement; silence and music proven equivalent through action and image. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is selective and biased. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., storm's origin) is taught and paid off. Rhythmic control under pressure enhances clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Clarity and momentum maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of emotion, sound, and silence feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details (heat-map, winterglass) avoid generic templates.</comment>
