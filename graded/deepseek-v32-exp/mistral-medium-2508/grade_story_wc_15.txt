<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elias's characterization is deeply embodied with calloused hands and raspy voice, and his motivation to mend ruins is consistent and intensifies under pressure. His final awakening is earned by prior sleepwalking causality, with visible cost in his aching bones and light heart. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the plot builds through patterned imagery to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the labyrinth transforms into a loom. Cost is legible in Elias's physical and emotional state, and the lens holds without ambiguity. Orientation is clear early with vivid setting anchors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "scent of rusted iron" and the labyrinth constrains choices, charging the final image as a door. The illustration plate functions as micro-setting, evolving to shape the climax. Details are purposefully integrated into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming ruin to reverence escalates through Elias's sleepwalking agency, culminating in the Heart Chamber where his touch shifts the labyrinth. Cost is unmistakable in the paths unraveling and his renewed purpose. Under the Accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of naming what was lost emerges through concrete images like weaving and the winged figure, with subtext in the final verse. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the labyrinth's transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct poetic voice, reflected in rhythmic prose like "his fingers tracing the grooves." Perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., sleepwalking) is taught and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, as in "sewing with memory," and propulsion accelerates toward the climax. Read-aloud test passes with clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story synthesizes weaving, labyrinths, and transformation with originality, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in non-linear structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specific details like the illustration plate create a fresh, organic angle.</comment>
