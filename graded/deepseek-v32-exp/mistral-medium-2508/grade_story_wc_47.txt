<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's watchful dreaming and embodied emotions drive key choices; her final renunciation of the pendant and embrace of moss is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the quiet exchange.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the shared breathing and planting; Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern density of thaw, moss, and growth; orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting as moss-choked data center constrains choices and charges the final image through tactile details like moss scent and icicle patterns; specificity avoids cliché and mirrors internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens driven by Lena's agency in proffering moss and pendant; cost is legible in the quiet trade-off that reweights stakes from viral shame to growth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of growth through wounds emerges non-literally via images like moss planting and pendant exchange; final reconfiguration of wounds as soil offers resonant ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature in Lena's poetic observation; dialogue carries subtext and natural rhythm; no head-hopping or register drift under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "cathedral of moss" coheres and accelerates momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-trauma recovery through unique setting and motifs; risk-taking in quiet climax feels inevitable, transforming familiar tropes with specific, grounded detail.</comment>
