<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to silence guilt is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority (tracing constellations, feeling amber's warmth) and a credible shift to witnessing earned by prior causality. The final choice to reach for the baby forecloses erasure with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hybrid drive lens holds with causal linkages (machine use backfires) and textural accumulation; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elara endures guilt instead of silencing it, with cost legible in "the cry didn’t stop. But this time, neither did she." Orientation is clear early, and persistent guilt shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful (laboratory hum, amber, speakers), with sensory details filtered through Elara's urgency. The amber as micro-setting constrains choices (cracking, mosquito twitching) and charges the final image (wings singing), meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silencing vs. facing guilt) escalates under the hybrid lens via Elara's agency (feeding paper, pressing wrist), leading to a meaningful tightening where she chooses witness over erasure with unmistakable cost. Pressure coheres and narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of guilt and acceptance emerges through particulars (amber as preserved guilt, machine as ledger) without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the image of witnessing, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice ("hummed like a dying star," "static coiled around her ribs") and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision (time folding) is taught and paid off at closure, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language ("fishing line through water") is coherent and purposeful. Propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and peak beats avoid muddle, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes haunted firmware and guilt in a non-obvious way, transforming tropes through specific details (constellation tattoos, amber). Turns feel earned, and risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
