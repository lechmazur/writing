<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his role as historian, with micro-choices like tracing the tapestry's stitches and feeding diaries to the fire revealing his values under pressure. His endurance is earned through prior causality, and interiority is concrete, though internal conflict is minimal but acceptable for length. The final choice to walk away forecloses a path with felt cost, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost when the world tilts and Elias accepts the displacement, reinforced by the tapestry's pulse and his unwavering walk. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with patterns of memory and displacement tightening meaning. Orientation is clear early, and the closure unit reweights options without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The silo library environment constrains choices, such as climbing the ladder and using the fireplace, and charges the final image with its metal skin sighing. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's POV, with the tapestry and diaries acting as micro-settings that shape tactics. The 9+ test is met as the setting alters options and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the Accumulative lens when he coaxes the embers with diaries, causing the axis to move and the world to tilt, narrowing his understanding. The cost is legible in the transformation of the tapestry and his acceptance of the hook behind his ribs. One meaningful tightening reweights the stake of collecting stories, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images like the displaced axis and the Sundering, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the realization that "They took the dreams. We took the sky." Subtext operates in gesture and implication, such as the tapestry's thrum, without moralizing. The final image reweights prior material with conceptual cost, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Elias, with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic prose that reflects his sensitively perceptive nature. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in lines like "the silo tilted—no, the world tilted," and any elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language like "the silo’s metal skin singing a note just shy of sorrow" serving purpose without muddle. No loops or scaffolds; sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and closure is clear. The 9+ test is met with zero artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements—silo library, displaced axis, tapestry—feels inevitable and fresh, with risk-taking in lyric style heightening stakes without obscuring clarity. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the half-burned diaries, and the closure reconfigures meaning organically. A non-obvious angle on post-apocalyptic themes earns high marks.</comment>
