<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits of strategic creativity and longing; her final choice to enter the door is earned by prior causality with visible cost from years of waiting, and interiority is embodied through actions like winding the clock.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the reunion and clock chiming, demonstrating a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost; causal lens holds strong from setup to payoff, and orientation is clear early with the tidal arbor and station piano.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the arbor groaning and compasses guiding Lena's path; it charges the final image with the door in the film, integrating sensory detail purposefully.</comment>
