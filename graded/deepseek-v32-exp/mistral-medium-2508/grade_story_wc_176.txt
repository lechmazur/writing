<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and rooted in guilt over past silence, with embodied emotion in "her chest ached with the shape of their absence." Her final choice to reconfigure the rope is earned by prior causality, showing contradictory impulses of holding tight versus letting go. The resolution forecloses a path with felt cost, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost legible in "the weight of silence" lifting and Elira's understanding. The accumulative/textural lens holds, reinforced by the sanctum's hum and aurora's response. Orientation is clear early, and the rope's reconfiguration drives the decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum and aurora pressure choices, constraining the ritual and charging the final image where "the walls wept." Sensory details like "blue-dark" and "crystallizing breath" are selective and purposeful, with the rope and card acting as micro-settings that alter tactics and outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elira's agency under the accumulative lens, from tracing the card to reconfiguring the rope, causing the sanctum to tremble and names to rise. Cost is unmistakable in her ache and subsequent lightness, narrowing options and reweighting stakes without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images like "lost wax casting remembers the hollow," offering a resonant, non-literal answer to preservation and forgiveness without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material with complexity, as Elira learns to let names change.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic syntax and rhythmic control under pressure. Elision, such as the punched card's dissolution, is taught and paid off, enhancing clarity without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "glow of a sound made visible" is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats, maintaining propulsion and clarity toward closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of memory preservation through mystical objects, transforming tropes of forgiveness with specific details like the punched card and ceremonial rope. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
