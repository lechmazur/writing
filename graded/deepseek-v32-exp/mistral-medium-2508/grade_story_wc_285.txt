<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Coachman's motivation is rooted in the parchment promise, with interiority shown through pulse quickening and hand movements; girl's micro-choices (stilling needle, speaking) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Final choice to cross is earned by prior causality of fog lifts, with cost in girl's departure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with pattern of fog lifts and gutter ticks leading to resonant reconfiguration; closure lands on-page with cost as girl dissolves into mist and needle is passed, altering cycle. Orientation is anchored early in fog and river setting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fog-bound river crossing constrains choice by dictating crossing timing; sensory details like "tick-tick-tick" of gutters and yarn needle's brass eye charge the final image. Environment pressures tactics through palpable damp and visibility shifts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of crossing safely escalates under accumulative lens via fog lifts and gutter slowing; coachman's agency in decision to cross forecloses option of waiting, with cost legible in girl's departure. One meaningful tightening occurs at second fog lift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of cycles and promises emerges through particulars like parchment and needle, with ending offering non-literal answer via girl's upstream walk. Subtext operates in gestures (needle passing) without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV stable on coachman with distinct perceptual signature in noticing fog "percolated"; poetic syntax and rhythmic control under pressure, as in "stitching meaning from the haze." No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, e.g., "thickening until the far bank dissolved into silvered nothing"; no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and clarity is maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mystical journey with palimpsest promise and yarn needle creating inevitable cycle; risk-taking in accumulative pattern pays off with closure. Specificity in objects like parchment prevents generic tropes.</comment>
