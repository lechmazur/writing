<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Qishti's characterization is deeply embodied with consistent traits like frugality shaping his actions; his internal conflict between science and faith is dramatized in key moments like his hesitation at the passage, and his final realization is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the loss of the tile.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with legible cost (tile gone, insight gained) under a causal lens; orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of his frugality shapes tactics, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The palace and tile function as micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Qishti's POV, with the tile's schematic directly influencing the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Qishti's agency under the causal lens, from finding the tile to using it, with cost unmistakable in the tile's disappearance and his transformed perspective; one meaningful tightening forecloses his old worldview.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of science versus faith emerges organically through events and imagery, with the ending offering a non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing; subtext operates in gestures like his kneeling in recognition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is consistent and poetic, modulating with pressure, and any elision (e.g., the cipher's deciphering) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats like the altar revelation, and syntax varies naturally to support rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of astronomer and mystical discovery tropes through specific details; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
