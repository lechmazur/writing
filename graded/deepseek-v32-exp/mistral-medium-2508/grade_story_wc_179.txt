<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lior's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure, such as pressing the pin back to "convince the past." The final renunciation of resentment is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the walking away. Contradictory impulses act in scene, like his chest aching while acknowledging Kael's role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in the pin staying whole and the brothers walking away. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with memory shifts and sensory details deepening stakes. Orientation is clear early, and the sanctuary's shifts cohere with the emotional arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary and music box function as micro-setting, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "silence—thick as wool" and "scent of rain" are selective and purposeful, filtered through Lior's POV. The object's evolution reweights meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of releasing resentment escalates under the accumulative lens through Lior's agency, such as prying the pin and later pressing it back. Cost is legible in the "weight of years unsaid" and the brothers' reconciliation. One meaningful tightening forecloses the path of holding grudges.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of grace and forgiveness emerges through particulars like the music box and sanctuary shifts, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in the "question they’d finally stopped asking." Subtext operates in gestures and silence, such as Kael's solid touch.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "silence—thick as wool." Rhythmic control under pressure, with dialogue carrying subtext ("Grace doesn’t keep to schedules"). No head-hopping; elision taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "heavy as regret." Sentence rhythm varies naturally, supporting emotional beats without obscuring clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of the soundless sanctuary and music box metaphor, transforming tropes of brotherly conflict. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The non-obvious integration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
