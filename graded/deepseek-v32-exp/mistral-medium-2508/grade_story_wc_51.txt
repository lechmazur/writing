<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; her internal conflict and embodied emotion (e.g., "boundary-lessly trapped") culminate in an earned realization ("she was the loom") with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, and the final renunciation is causally driven by prior burdens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing (Elira's realization reweights her role) and felt cost ("the hush settle inside her"); the accumulative/textural lens holds, reinforced by patterned imagery. Orientation is clear early, and the grotto's return of weights escalates stakes coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The bronze grotto and lamp burner constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details (e.g., "damp," "starlight seep") are selective and POV-filtered. The setting pressures tactics, such as the grotto's exhale shaping Elira's method.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elira's agency under the accumulative lens, as the grotto's return of weights deepens stakes; cost is legible when burdens dissolve ("crumble into dust"). One meaningful tightening occurs when the grotto gives back, forcing her realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (e.g., burdens as "kelp" or "rust") without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the "cradle" image. Subtext operates in silence and implication, enriching the concept of carrying others' sorrows.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature ("whalebone harp" rhythm) and controlled elision; no head-hopping. The poetic diction remains consistent under pressure, enhancing the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language (e.g., "shingled hush") is purposeful and coherent. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the grotto's shudder, maintaining clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of fractal weaving and burden calcification; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, transformed through specific details like the lamp burner's orientation.</comment>
