Interiority is embodied and specific, avoiding stock phrasing. The final endurance forecloses his empty path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with the green sand and new tracks reweighting the premise with hope; cost is legible in the world's renewal.
