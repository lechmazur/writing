<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority (e.g., "a bruise of indigo") and micro-choices under pressure. His final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in scars and drowning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elias accepts drowning, with cost legible in hissing scars and swallowed footsteps. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraint (rising water) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective (e.g., "violet hum of rust," "sunken orchard greenhouse"), constraining choices via rising water and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, escalation deepens via density increase (forge lighting, imprint remembering, water rising), driven by Elias's agency. Cost is unmistakable in scars and submerged footsteps.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events (e.g., trust eroding like rust), with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext operates through gesture and silence, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Poetic compression is taught and paid off at closure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis (hearing aids and absences), with risk-taking in poetic structure that heightens stakes. Emotional truth and specificity make it inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
