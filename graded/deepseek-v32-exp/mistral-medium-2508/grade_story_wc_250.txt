<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The guardian's spiraling calm and the boy's trembling hands embody contradictory impulses under pressure, with micro-choices like weaving light patterns earning his emotional shift. His renunciation of verbal absolution for remembered starlight carries visible cost in his eased shoulders and lighter steps. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority is concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (earned stasis) where the boy's internal shift forecloses his path of shame with felt cost in his steadier breath. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the dental mirror's reprise in the father's hands charges the final image. Persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The cobalt dock and rain-slick planks pressure choices by limiting sensory scope, while the shutters and dental mirror as micro-setting objects constrain the guardian's actions and charge the closure. Sensory details like "canal’s breath fogged the air" are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, escalation is driven by the guardian's weaving and mirror adjustments, deepening the boy's stake from muttered confession to kneeling acceptance. Cost is legible in his shoulders dropping and pockets lightening, with agency in his choice to touch the water and remember stars.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of silent empathy emerges through concrete images like the mirror reflecting unconcerned stars, offering a non-literal answer to guilt without moralizing. The final line refines the concept without assertion, reweighting prior material through the boy's embodied realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to the guardian, with distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "shadows pooled between the boats like forgotten promises." Lyrical compression is taught early and paid off at closure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences like "a sliver of reflection skated across the water, a fractured star" doing multiple jobs. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle; closure image remains clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of silent guardian, dental mirror, and light patterns feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like the shutters' "click, sigh." Risk-taking in lyrical stillness heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional specificity avoids templates.</comment>
