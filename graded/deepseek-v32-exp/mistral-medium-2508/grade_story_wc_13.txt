<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elspeth's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, driving key choices like throwing the jar and pulling the echo's leash. Her interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values. The boy applies immediate pressure, though he edges toward archetype with "eyes too old" and "sharp teeth," a minor flaw not touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with cost: the city gasps, giant shifts, and moths return, a decisive change under the causal lens. Orientation is anchored early by ~120 words. The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and the echo's leash dissolution provides a felt cost that charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral to choice: the rooftop canal system pressures Elspeth's actions, such as throwing the jar into the water. Sensory details like "canals black and slow as ink" are selective and purposeful. The environment constrains tactics and charges the closure when the water hisses and stills.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preventing the giant's wake—escalates through protagonist agency under the causal lens, from the boy's threat to Elspeth's jar throw and leash pull. Cost is legible when the city holds its breath and the giant shifts. The tightening forecloses options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like time borrowing and echoes, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "the echoes were only just beginning to speak," reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and image, such as the pendant humming against her collarbone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature filtering through Elspeth's perspective. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in the boy's "Not stealing. Borrowing." Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, with no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "a labyrinth of canals carved into the rooftops" is consistent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the climax, and clarity is maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes time sculpting, echoes, and a dreamlike city into a fresh, inevitable premise. Risk-taking in structure and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through specific details like the moths dissolving into sketches.</comment>
