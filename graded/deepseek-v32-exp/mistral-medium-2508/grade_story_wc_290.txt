<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elias's claustrophobia and drive are vividly embodied through micro-choices under pressure; his final decision to remake the city is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in his understanding of his father's compass.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from compass use to key insertion; closure is a decisive change with felt cost in the blueprint's rebirth and Elias's transformed fear; orientation is immediate and pattern pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices via spatial mutiny and claustrophobic pressure; the compass and key charge the final image with warmth and weight, integrating environment into closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency against spatial mutiny; stakes tighten through organ screams and shifting walls, with cost visible in the rewritten city and his lingering fear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of rebellious remaking emerges organically from compass and key use; ending reweights prior material without moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the blueprint's breath.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature filters setting through Elias's fear and need; rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied syntax; figurative language coheres in peak beats like "petals of rock"; no loops or artifacts, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny and transfixing action synthesize fresh concepts; risk-taking in lyrical abstraction pays off with inevitability, and the story commits fully to its premise.</comment>
