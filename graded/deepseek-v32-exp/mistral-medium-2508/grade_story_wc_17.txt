<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and contradictory impulses when he hears his father's voice.

The trait of perceptive ear enables key actions but lacks specific cost, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration under a causal-accumulative lens, as the corridor's echo changes to a song and the legacy reweights from chain to thread. Orientation is clear early, and the cost is legible in the final image of the open threshold. The drive lens holds without ambiguity, with persistent constraints shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the ivy-veiled passage and alcove constraining choices like the split path and sealed door.
