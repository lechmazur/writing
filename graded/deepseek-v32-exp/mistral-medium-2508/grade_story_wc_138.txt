<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lysander's boredom and curiosity are vividly embodied, driving micro-choices like tracing seams and pressing the amulet; his final decision to let go is earned by prior causality with cost felt in the transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate, the accumulative/textural lens holds, and closure lands as a conceptual repricing where the void redefines goodbye, cost legible in his laughter and loss of certainty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The escondite's sensory-rich details—shifting colors, magnetic fields—actively constrain choices and charge the final image; the amulet and environment are indispensable to the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through spatial mutiny driven by Lysander's agency; his amulet drop is a decisive tightening with cost of unmaking his eternal boredom, under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of goodbye emerges organically from the amulet's curse and Lysander's arc; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights letting go as honesty without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Poetic, stable POV with distinct perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure enhances the accumulative build, and purposeful elision pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dense, figurative prose is voice-motivated and purposeful, with high information density and clear propulsion; no loops or scaffold, and peak beats maintain clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of immortal boredom and spatial rebellion feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the premise is transformed through specific detail.</comment>
