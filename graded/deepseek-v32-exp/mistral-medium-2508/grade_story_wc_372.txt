<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion (e.g., hands trembling at the woman's face) and a final choice earned by prior causality. His internal conflict between duty and personal connection is shown in scene, not summary. The resolution forecloses the library's path with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Elias steps onto the bridge, costing the library's dissolution. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of time shapes tactics. Cost is legible in "the library dissolved behind him," fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The frozen library setting actively pressures choices (e.g., shelves collapsing) and charges the final image of the bridge. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (ozone smell, ice shifting), filtered through Elias's POV. The lantern slide as a micro-setting object constrains action and reweights meaning, exceeding the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, stakes escalate through density increases (library groans, vows lost) and Elias's agency drives the tightening toward the heart. The cost is unmistakable in the trade-off between library's dissolution and vow kept. One meaningful deepening is sufficient, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory and meaning emerges from particulars (vows as invitations, library as grave) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the bridge and "beginning," reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, like the woman's voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "quartz hush," selective attention to fading light). Voice is poetic yet controlled under pressure, with rhythmic variation. No head-hopping or elision issues; dialogue (woman's voice) is natural and advances plot, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and enhances clarity (e.g., "like ink fading from parchment"). Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and read-aloud flow is smooth, meeting the 9+ test without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes frozen library and luminous vows into a non-obvious, inevitable whole, with risk-taking in lyric accumulative style that heightens stakes. Emotional truth arises from specific details (e.g., love letters that burn). Transformation of tropes (vows as ghosts) avoids derivation, exceeding the 9+ test.</comment>
