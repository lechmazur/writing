<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied with clear motivation rooted in memory and loss; interiority shows contradictory impulses (bitterness and preservation) acting in scene, and the final endurance (not looking back) is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The archivist's micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing the locket and whispering old words, reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in "the covenant was not yet complete, but it was breathing"; the accumulative/textural lens holds, building through details and mood. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of memory loss shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the blooming jetty and twilight harbor constraining choices (e.g., groaning jetty and tide pulling) and charging the final image through recurring violets and ink. Sensory details are selective and filtered through POV, avoiding cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with stakes deepening through actions like tracing the locket and steeping in memory; cost is unmistakable in the unresolved covenant and the archivist's renunciation. One meaningful tightening occurs as context shifts by her hand.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and preservation emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in gestures like the locket and ink; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through "covenant breathing" that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a poetic, perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure is evident in lines like "Twilight bled into the harbor," and elision (e.g., memory steeping) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats. Minor overuse of metaphor in some lines (e.g., "euphoria, haunted") slightly muddles clarity but does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality lies in a specific synthesis of memory, covenant, and proximate causes, feeling inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through grounded details like walnut ink and the blooming jetty.</comment>
