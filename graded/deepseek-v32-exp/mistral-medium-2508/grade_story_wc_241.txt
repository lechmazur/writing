<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is clear and rooted in her father's illness and her probability background; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., palms stinging). The final choice to leap is earned by prior causality, showing contradictory impulses in scene. Micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost (new pulse, lantern dark) as a Conceptual Repricing under a Hybrid lens; causality is tight from scrawls to traversal. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. Persistent constraint of the lantern shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful with sensory details (smell of wet paper, fractured mica); the lantern constrains choices and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details are filtered through Lila's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (search for answers vs. recovery plan) escalates under Hybrid lens through Lila's agency (lighting lantern, choosing paths). Cost is legible in her step into the unknown, foreclosing safe options. One meaningful tightening occurs with the blue/gold choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of probability vs. luck emerges through events and images, not statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the new pulse reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures like the shattered hypothesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and character-specific, modulating under pressure. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (e.g., library dissolution) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts; figurative language is purposeful (e.g., "shattered hypothesis"). No loops or scaffold; sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of probability and magic realism feels inevitable; tropes are transformed through specific choices (e.g., contradictions as seams). Risk-taking with surreal elements heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
