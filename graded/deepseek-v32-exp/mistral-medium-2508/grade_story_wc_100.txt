<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's weary dedication is embodied through concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as feeling the lens's vibration and deciding to climb the lighthouse. His motivation to give rest intensifies credibly, and his final understanding of rest is earned by prior causality with visible cost when the lens crumbles.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot coheres under an accumulative/textural lens, with the package arrival inciting a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page as Elias adds his name to the ledger, redefining rest with felt cost in the lens's destruction and the dead's completion. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices, such as the library's waterlogged shelves constraining Elias's work and the lighthouse's rusted structure challenging his climb. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, with the bioluminescent anemones and fractured dome charging the final image of stillness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes around giving rest escalate through Elias's agency under the accumulative lens, as his swim and lens reassembly deepen the cost. The dominant stake tightens meaningfully when the dead rise and sink back with weight, foreclosing other paths and affirming his role with legible cost in the lens's crumble.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of rest as active signal emerges organically from particulars like the ledger and lens, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Elias's realization that "rest wasn’t the absence of movement," reweighting prior imagery with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetically controlled, with a perceptual signature biased by Elias's sorrow. POV is stable and single, with rhythmic prose that modulates under pressure, such as the anemones flickering "like panicked hearts." No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with strong verbs and cohesive figurative language (e.g., "pulse slow, like the breath of a sleeping beast"). No loops, scaffold, or register drift; closure image remains clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes undertaker and sunken city with fresh specificity, transforming tropes through grounded choices like the lens as a key to rest. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes, and the final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
