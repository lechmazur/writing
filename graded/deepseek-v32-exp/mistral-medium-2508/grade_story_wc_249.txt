<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and micro-choices like drumming fingers and singing with her hands. Her final choice to release memories is earned by prior sabotage, showing credible endurance with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost—Lira's mind becomes her own, and the garden's hum softens—under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and causality holds through her agency-driven actions. The cost is legible in the final image of the sky reflecting grieflessness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The sound wave garden and auric lagoon constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like crystalline reeds and ripples shimmering. Setting is woven into action, reflecting internal states without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (lagoon) actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as her drumming and singing intensify to release memories, reweighting the dominant stake of freeing her mind. Cost is unmistakable in the dissolution of sorrow and the garden's transformed song.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and identity emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures like drumming.

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Lira's urgency.
