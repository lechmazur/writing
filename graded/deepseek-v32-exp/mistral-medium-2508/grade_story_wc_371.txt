<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her trait of noticing the askew, driving her to plant the bread and bake loaves. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotions, such as fingers hovering over the warm bread. Micro-choices under pressure, like pressing crumbs into the soil, reveal her values. The final choice to lead the prince into the wheat is earned by prior causality, though internal conflict is subtle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as the bakery reappears and coins feel like enough, reweighting the premise with cost under an accumulative/textural lens. Causality is clear from bread discovery to city change, with orientation anchored early. The cost is legible in the final image of normalized strangeness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the tea house and courtyard constraining choices—the oven roars to life, the wheat grows where the fountain stood. Sensory details like steam rising and scent of yeast are selective and POV-filtered. The environment charges the final image of the wheat field and reappeared bakery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of confronting strangeness vs. adjusting escalates through Liora's agency—planting crumbs, baking, distributing loaves—under an accumulative lens. Cost is legible as the city stops adjusting, with guards kneeling and prince weeping. One meaningful tightening forecloses the path of normalization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of finding the sacred in the ordinary emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures like the prince weeping. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the bakery's return and felt coins. No moralizing; complexity lingers in the refusal to look away.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, noticing vines curling toward the moon. Voice is poetic and controlled, with rhythmic prose under pressure. Elision is purposeful, such as the whispered guess lighting the oven, paid off at closure. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "flour once dusted the air like snow." Sentences advance story and atmosphere without obscuring causality. Closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in a fresh synthesis of magical realism and urban decay, with specific details like the reversed river on Tuesdays. Tropes are transformed through Liora's gentle resistance. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
