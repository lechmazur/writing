<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Veyra's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions like her breath hitching at the fracture discovery. Her final choice to plant the sapling is earned by prior causality, foreclosing her pilot role with visible cost as the arrow tip crumbles. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost—the arrow tip disintegrates, and Veyra's role shifts to planter—under a causal lens that holds throughout. Orientation is anchored early with the inversion and glider, and the plot advances via because/therefore linkages from her discoveries to the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The orchard planet setting constrains choices, such as navigating by upward-flowing rivers and the moss accelerating growth, charging the final image of the humming arches. Sensory details are vivid and selective, filtered through Veyra's POV, with spatial choreography remaining coherent during inversion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Veyra's agency under the causal lens, from discovering the fracture to retrieving the seed, with cost legible in the moss spreading on her skin and the arrow tip's dissolution. The dominant stake of finding resilience tightens through her actions, foreclosing options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as the seed pulsing and echoes as instructions, offering a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. The final realization that resilience is grown reweights prior material with complexity, avoiding simplistic binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Veyra's urgency, such as "the whirling silence bloom into understanding." Syntax and rhythm modulate under pressure, and purposeful compression (e.g., "The echoes weren’t ghosts. They were instructions.") enhances clarity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds; figurative language like "the silence didn’t feel empty. It felt like a breath held before a shout" is coherent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh specificity—gravity inversions and bioluminescent moss—transformed through Veyra's journey, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyric tone heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure image charges prior particulars with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
