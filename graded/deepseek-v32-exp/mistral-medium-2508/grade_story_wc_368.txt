<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dye master's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and earned change; his final realization that the heart recognizes "cracks in people" where stories need to be is rooted in prior causality and cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the heart settles into his own rhythm, cost is legible when the wing dissolves, and causal lens holds strong from inciting incident to resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the floating tea house isolating the dye master and the blue morpho wing charging the final image through its dissolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency, moving from curiosity to active illumination of stories, with cost visible in the wing's dissolution and his transformed silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer about stories filling hollows in people without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic rhythm, such as "its iridescence flickering like a held breath," and no head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "the wing dissolved into his palm like sugar in tea" is clear and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and ingeniously synthesized, with magical realism elements heightening stakes; the transformation of the dye master feels inevitable and risks coherence.</comment>
