<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as trembling when tracing the sketch. His change from isolation to engagement is earned through the diary's revelations, with visible cost in his decision to break silence. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws complicate choices credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change as Elias sets up the repair service, reconfiguring his stance on empathy with felt cost. Causal lens holds strong from diary discovery to action, and orientation is clear early. The final image of mending the music box charges prior material without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like beeswax and copper, and the workshop constrains choices by housing the device and diary. The fireworks timeframe pressures tactics, and the diary as a micro-setting charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake in empathy versus silence escalates through Elias's agency, driven by diary entries and fireworks. Cost is legible when he forecloses isolation by going to the ruins. One meaningful tightening under causal lens, with no coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the diary's entries and the repair service, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on when to break silence. Subtext operates in gestures and images, such as the uncurled hand, without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through concrete scenes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic yet precise language. Voice modulates with emotional pressure, and elision (e.g., diary contents) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; dialogue, when present, carries subtext economically.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts. Sentences advance story and atmosphere selectively, such as the description of silence as "texture." Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, clarity upheld in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept of collecting silences via frequencies is fresh and synthesized organically with character and conflict. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details like the vibration language avoid template plots.</comment>
