<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is clear and rooted in her trauma from the death certificate error, with embodied emotions (e.g., pulse syncing with voice) and micro-choices (rubbing the porcelain shard) that reveal her values. Internal conflict is shown through her fear of the count stopping versus her pursuit of the static, and her final acceptance is earned by prior causality. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Lena syncs with the static, reconfiguring her stance from fear to connection (Resonant Reconfiguration). The hybrid drive lens (causal-accumulative) holds, with events linked through her actions (defragmenting archives). Orientation is clear early, and the death certificate constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful (opal observatory, snow, auroras), with sensory details integrated into action (ink patterns, porcelain shard). The observatory pressures choices by housing the archives, and the shard charges the final image as it becomes warm and smooth, constraining Lena's emotional arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (identity erosion) escalates under the hybrid lens through Lena's agency (defragmenting in response to the voice). Cost is legible as she foregoes fear for connection, narrowing options. One meaningful tightening occurs when the voice offers and she acts, driven by protagonist choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (possibility in failure) emerges through particulars like the porcelain shard and defragmenting, with subtext in imagery (static as chorus). The ending offers a non-literal answer ("Not failure. Possibility") that reweights prior material without moralizing, earned through Lena's struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Lena, with distinct perceptual signature (lyrical, rhythmic prose reflecting her state). No head-hopping; voice controls elision (e.g., ink patterns) taught early and paid off at closure. Dialogue-like voice from static carries subtext and advances plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language consistent and purposeful (e.g., "auroras pulsed like a dying heartbeat"). No loops, scaffold, or register drift; clarity and propulsion are maintained even in peak beats like the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes digital ghost and identity trauma in a fresh, non-obvious way, with tropes transformed through specific details (observatory as consciousness). Turns feel inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
