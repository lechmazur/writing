<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Alchemist's interior contradiction (doubt vs. determination) acts in scene; final choice to step forward is earned by prior causality with visible cost (workshop dissolution). Embodied emotion in "face half-drowned in doubt" avoids stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost (loss of workshop, transformation); Hybrid lens holds (causal actions blend with accumulative imagery). Orientation is clear within 120 words; acid sea constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (acid sea, workshop) pressures choices and charges final image; sensory details like "scent of corroded copper" are selective and POV-filtered. Micro-setting (keys, statue) constrains choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by alchemist's agency under Hybrid lens (key use amid sea's advance); cost is legible in dissolution. Dominant stake (meaning/conjuration) tightens through one meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of kintsugi emerges through particulars (keys, scars) without moralizing; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via transformation image. Subtext in gesture and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature; poetic voice modulates under pressure ("a face half-drowned in doubt"). No head-hopping; elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high information density with clear propulsion. Figurative language ("like a scream frozen mid-birth") is purposeful and coherent in peak beats. Rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of kintsugi with soul repair; specific details (drowned clockwork bird) avoid template plots. Risk-taking in style heightens stakes without gimmickry; transformation feels inevitable.</comment>
