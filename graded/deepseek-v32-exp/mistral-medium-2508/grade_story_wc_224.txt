<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through concrete memories and embodied emotions. His final choice to accept the role of Keeper is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the mountain's sigh and sealed door. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as his past avoidance versus current pursuit, driving higher-stakes choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias accepts his role, reconfiguring his identity with cost legible in the mountain's reaction. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through imagery and patterns to a cadence shift. Orientation is clear early, and the plot flows naturally from search to discovery without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integral, constraining choices like the false wall in the Poetics of Silence section and charging the final image of the circular room. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, such as "ripples through the air" and "dust rained from the ceiling." The environment and micro-setting (stone, feather) actively shape tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of internal conflict escalates through Elias's agency under the Accumulative lens, with density increase in glyph shifts and map revelations. Cost is unmistakable in the mountain's groan and shelves trembling. His decision to plant the seed narrows options and forecloses paths with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of buried talents and self-discovery emerges organically through events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "The language wasn’t for speaking. It was for planting," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the feather texture and stone as mirror.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, such as "mercury-glass eyes" and "ripples through the air." Voice is poetic and rhythmic, controlling elision purposefully (e.g., dreams substituted for reality). No head-hopping; diction matches the seer's nature and heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with figurative language enhancing the story without muddle. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance story, character, or atmosphere efficiently. Rhythm varies naturally, and syntax supports emotional beats, as in the climax with the mountain groaning.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of mountain-as-bookstore and language seeding, transforming tropes through specific details like mercury residue. Risk-taking in structure and imagery pays off, heightening stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with emotional truth in Elias's journey.</comment>
