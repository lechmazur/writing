<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's characterization is concrete with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, though the passenger remains slightly abstract; his motivation to teach silence compels choices with visible cost in her unclenching shoulders.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost as the passenger's weight recalibrates, and orientation is clear early with the storm glass and canals.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the storm glass vial and prism terrace constraining choices and charging the final image through tactile, sensory detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens is driven by Elias's agency in monitoring noise and using the vial; cost is legible when the passenger's shoulders unclench, though stakes are quiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence as comfort emerges through particulars like the vial's reaction and the prism's refraction, with a non-literal, resonant answer at the end without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; elision in silence is taught and paid off, and dialogue is minimal but effective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of silence and transit feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet narrative heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and details are uniquely specific.</comment>
