<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and rooted in rivalry with Veyra, intensifying under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "tremor in her ribs"), and her final choice to transmute herself is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a decisive change with felt cost (learning to carry weight); causal lens holds tightly from coin discovery to experiment; orientation is anchored early, and persistent constraints (coin, crucible) shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful ("iron ribs groaned," "rain-washed walls"), with sensory detail filtered through POV; the foundry and crucible constrain choices and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding weight of names) escalates through Liora's agency under causal lens; cost is legible in risk of ash vs. enlightenment, and one meaningful tightening (feeding the coin) forecloses options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of meaning and cracks emerges through events and images (kintsugi, vial memory), not statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is lyrical and coherent under pressure, and any elision (e.g., memory dialogue) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats, supporting propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of alchemy and kintsugi feels inevitable; specific choices in character and theme transform tropes, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
