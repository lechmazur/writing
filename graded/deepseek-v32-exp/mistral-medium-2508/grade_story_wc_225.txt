<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tutor's characterization is deeply integrated with his motivation for self-forgiveness, shown through concrete micro-choices like winnowing the tapestry and kneeling at the labyrinth. His internal conflict—contradictory impulses of regret and redemption—acts simultaneously in scene, culminating in an earned renunciation of his need to win. The final choice to play without looking ahead is rooted in prior causality, with visible cost when he laughs at being checkmated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a decisive change with felt cost: the tutor's palm pressed to the labyrinth absorbs regret, and the village exhales, signaling time's flow. The hybrid drive lens (causal and accumulative) holds, with because/therefore linkages (unraveling threads leads to revelation) and textural density (tapestry motifs reconfigure). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of the labyrinth as a mirror shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth and tapestry function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image—the labyrinth's pulse shifts in memory, and the tapestry's mended border becomes a map of scars. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like the "woven hush" and "frozen laughter," filtered through the tutor's bias. Spatial choreography is coherent, with the village square and hearth anchoring movement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the hybrid lens: his winnowing of the tapestry narrows options by revealing past failures, forcing a trade-off between hiding or holding regrets. The cost is legible when the tapestry's border burns and yields a confession, leading to his decision to weave threads back. Pressure tightens through a meaningful deepening that changes knowledge, foreclosing his path of exile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of redemption emerges organically from particulars—the tapestry's threads whisper fragments of betrayal, and the final image of the board reset offers a resonant, non-literal answer to self-forgiveness. Subtext operates in silence and gesture, like the girl's outstretched hand, avoiding moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete struggle, such as the tutor recognizing his wrong in leaving.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person with a distinct perceptual signature—the tutor's chess-based worldview colors observations, like seeing the labyrinth as a board reset. Voice modulates under pressure with rhythmic control, from the "woven hush" to the "thunder's lull" internalized. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven, as the girl's invitation carries subtext without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences accelerating in tension (e.g., "His breath came sharp, productive") and breathing in resolution. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, like "the silence were a held breath." Line-level craft supports clarity and momentum, with strong verbs and specific nouns throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of chess strategy, time-frozen village, and woven tapestry feels organic and non-obvious, transformed through specific character choices. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes, as the labyrinth's role as a mirror rather than a puzzle pays off at closure. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, with the tutor's flawed past deepening the redemption arc.</comment>
