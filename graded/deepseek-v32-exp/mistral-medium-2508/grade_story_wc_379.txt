<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is concrete with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as pressing the locket to her ear; her final endurance as curator is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the community's response.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the weight of Elena's voice; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, reinforced by the locket's persistent pulse shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The courtyard functions as a micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image; sensory details like "cracked tiles in gold and rose" are selective and purposeful, mirroring internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Accumulative lens, from discovering the locket to opening the mailbox; cost is legible in the "weight of a voice she hadn't earned" and the community's healing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the locket's message and community storytelling; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer on healing through listening without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice modulates under pressure, such as in the rhythmic "tick-tick" description, and elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "like a half-remembered secret" is purposeful and coherent in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of magical realism and community healing; risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
