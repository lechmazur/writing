<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; internal conflict between logic and emotion is embodied in the key choice, with the final sacrifice earned by prior causality and visible cost as she unravels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (artifact stabilized, protagonist transformed) under a causal lens; cost is legible in her physical unraveling and the marina's adaptation, with persistent ice-thinning constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the drift-ice marina and sphere constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details like "groaned beneath her boots" and "dust that glittered like crushed pearl" are filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (world protection) escalate through ice-thinning urgency; protagonist agency drives the turning point, with cost unmistakable in her bodily dissolution and the marina's fragile hold.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of absolution as adaptation emerges through particulars like vibrational matching and the final hymn-like beam; ending offers a non-literal answer that reweights sacrifice as work without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a poetic, perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure, such as in "the sphere’s song exploded upward," and no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "forgiven by physics" is coherent and purposeful, supporting propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sonic absolution, crypt key, and drift-ice setting feels inevitable; risk-taking in transformative sacrifice heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure is fully committed.</comment>
