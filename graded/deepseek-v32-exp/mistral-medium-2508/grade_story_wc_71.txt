<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, driving her to higher-stakes choices. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, and her final realization is earned by prior causality. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, though minor contradictions in impulse could be sharper.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration where Liora's changed perception lands with felt cost in the final image. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening. No causality breaks, but slight ambiguity in the voice's origin slightly tempers the score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with the bay and displaced objects constraining Liora's choices and charging the closure. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV, and spatial choreography is coherent. The environment actively shapes the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are internal and accumulative, escalating through density increase and Liora's agency in arranging objects. Cost is legible in her altered perception, foreclosing prior paths. One meaningful tightening under the lens drives the narrative, though escalation is subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence and listening emerges organically through particulars, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gesture and image, avoiding moralizing. The final reconfiguration reweights prior material without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that filters detail through Liora's bias. Prose rhythm and diction are controlled under pressure, and any elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; voice is coherent and specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, enhancing momentum. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The concept of a "shard of hush" is a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight, transforming familiar tropes through specific detail. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure is legible and charged.</comment>
