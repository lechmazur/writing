<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority (e.g., calloused fingers, ribs aching). His final choice to thread the button is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost as he leaves it as an offering. Micro-choices under stress reveal a hierarchy of values, and the resolution avoids diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (hourglass turning backward) and resonant reconfiguration under the causal lens, cost legible in the canyon holding its breath and Elias's offering. Orientation is anchored early (who, where, when by ~120 words), and the prophecy constraint shapes tactics throughout. No causality breaks; the ending reweights prior material without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (warehouse shelves, treacherous cliffs, well) and charges the final image (button on well's rim). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., amber glowing, wind howling), filtered through Elias's POV. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment mirrors internal stakes without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hourglass breaking, cliffs collapsing) escalates under causal lens through Elias's agency, culminating in a tightening choice at the well. Cost is unmistakable when the hourglass turns backward, altering time's flow. The prophecy drives pressure, and the resolution forecloses options with a visible trade-off (leaving the button).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (shared wisdom as choice, not foreknowledge) emerges through particulars (buttons, echoes) and the final image without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication (e.g., "The hourglass doesn’t break. We do"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior events, avoiding abstraction or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "veined with fossilized resin that glowed faintly"). Voice is consistent and rhythmic under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., prophecy fragments) is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated (e.g., "jar’s echo slithered free"). Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats. No register drift or template cadence issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis (hourglass turner, preserved whispers, buttons as fate pivots) that feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific details (e.g., ledger in code, amber warehouse). Risk-taking in structure and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure integrates elements organically.</comment>
