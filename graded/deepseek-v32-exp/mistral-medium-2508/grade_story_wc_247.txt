<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias and Liora exhibit concrete interiority and embodied emotions, with micro-choices under pressure driving the climax. Motivation to map silence and disrupt forgetting is consistent and intensifies, compelling higher-stakes choices. The final renunciation ("we remembered them back") is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the camera's changed weight. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies detract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive lens holds throughout, building to a resonant reconfiguration closure where the forgotten are remembered back. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible in the camera's heaviness and the harbor's alive silence. The lens remains consistent, with no causality breaks or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The luminous harbor setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "scent of salt and old wood" and waves rising in color. Environment pressures tactics and mirrors internal states, evolving coherently with the action. Spatial choreography is clean, and details are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of remembering the forgotten escalates under the accumulative lens through increased density and pattern breaks, driven by protagonist agency. Liora's lunge and Elias's signing narrow options, with cost visible in the camera's weight and the harbor's transformed silence. No coincidental resolutions undercut earned causality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory and redemption emerges through events and images, not direct statement, with subtext in gestures like disrupting and mapping silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("the forgotten began to sing") that reweights prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in the poetic prose and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure, enhancing the accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and supports mood, though minor overwriting in dense beats doesn't harm closure. Sentences are concise and purposeful, with clear propulsion and no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sign language, vintage camera, and mapping silence feels organic and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific choices. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise is fresh with emotional specificity. No derivative echoes or middle-ground hedging.</comment>
