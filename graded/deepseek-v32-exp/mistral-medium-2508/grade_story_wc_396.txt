<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elias's shift from passive peacekeeper to active intervener is earned through concrete interiority and micro-choices, such as feeling the fragment's pulse and deciding to "reconstitute the moment." His "shadow-laced" nature and empathy create credible contradiction under pressure, with the final choice foreclosing his passive path at visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Elias steps onto the ice, charged by the causal lens (visions compel action) and felt cost in the "groaning" ice and shattered mirrors. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard and ice floes pressure choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like "frost that rimmed the doorframe" and "groaning" ice constraining tactics. The fragment and mirrors function as micro-settings that evolve with the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the causal lens through Elias's agency, moving from doubt to intervention, with cost legible in his step onto the "hungry" ice. The dominant stake (saving the girl) tightens meaningfully via his embodied choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Elias's arc—empathy mapped to action—without moralizing, culminating in the resonant image of "reconstitute the moment itself." Subtext operates through gestures like the fragment "pulsing" and mirrors whispering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature ("gnarled apple trees clinging... like old men") and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful elision in visions is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high density and propulsion without loops or scaffold, e.g., "the beam above spinning its slow, methodical warning." Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, with no muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of tropes (seer's fragment, peacekeeper) feels inevitable through specific details like vintage store mirrors and ice floes. Risk-taking in lyrical compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
