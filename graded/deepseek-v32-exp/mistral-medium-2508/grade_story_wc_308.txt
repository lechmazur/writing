<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The skimmer's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices that reveal his values. His final stance as the anchor is earned through prior causality, with visible cost when he risks attracting the Hollow Maw. No stock phrases or unearned epiphanies; contradictions in impulse are subtle but present in his stillness versus movement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under the Accumulative lens, with the skimmer becoming the echo and the canyon falling silent, reweighting options with felt cost. The lens holds consistently, and orientation is clear early. The arrowhead's persistent constraint shapes tactics, and cost is legible in the risk taken.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with bone towers and canyon echoes pressuring choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, and the arrowhead acts as a micro-setting that constrains action. No generic description; environment directly alters tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the skimmer's agency under the Accumulative lens, from detecting the anomaly to becoming the anchor, with cost legible in the Hollow Maw's approach. Stakes are dominant and tighten meaningfully, foreclosing options through his renunciation of movement. No coincidence or static conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of stillness and anchoring pulses emerges organically through images and events, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and implication, and the final reconfiguration reweights prior material. No abstract statements or thematic drift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature that reflects the skimmer's mindset. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision (e.g., the Hollow Maw's shape) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats. Minor overwriting in places (e.g., "indifferent and endless" stars) but does not harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of concepts like harmonic reading and Hollow Maws, transformed through specific world-building and character stance. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
