<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with embodied interiority through sensory translation. His micro-choices under pressure, like pressing his ear to the ground, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final earned stasis—mapping his grief—is causally linked to prior actions, with visible cost in the reconfigured silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost: grief is mapped, not erased. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory patterns to the stillpoint moment. Orientation is clear early, and the compass ring's role tightens causality without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory detail filtered through Elian's blindness. Recurring objects like the compass ring and trees shape tactics, and spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes (navigating grief) escalate under the Accumulative lens via density increases in sensory trails and ring pulsations. Protagonist agency drives each beat, culminating in a cost legible on-page: grief is mapped with visible trade-offs, foreclosing earlier paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the stillpoint and bone carving, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to grief without moralizing. Subtext operates through image and implication, such as "remember" reweighting prior material, and the ending avoids abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, emphasizing non-visual senses. Lyrical prose and rhythmic control under pressure enhance voice, and purposeful elision (e.g., "unfold") is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the stillpoint revelation. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, ensuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes unique elements (e.g., ultrasonic forest, skin-absorbed languages) into an inevitable whole, transforming the quest trope through specific details. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels earned.</comment>
