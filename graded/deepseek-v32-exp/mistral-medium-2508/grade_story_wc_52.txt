<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The widow's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with interiority shown through concrete actions like carving. Her final choice to keep the lion is earned by prior causality, demonstrating a credible endurance with visible cost. Contradictory impulses—holding on versus letting go—are dramatized in scene, not summarized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) under an accumulative/textural lens, with the widow's decision to keep the carving reweighting her grief. The cost is legible in the final image, and the lens holds without ambiguity. Orientation is clear within the first 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The loft setting constrains choice by being the space where she carves, and the rain-beaded skylight charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV. The environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the widow's agency under the accumulative lens, from carving to the interaction with the girl, leading to her decisive choice. The cost is unmistakable in her renunciation of selling the carving. Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of "here and gone" emerges through events and images, not direct statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, such as the lion stepping out of wood. No moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in the poetic, rhythmic prose. Voice modulates with emotional pressure, and any elision is purposeful. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, and diction is precise and voice-motivated. Peak beats maintain clarity without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise offers a fresh angle on grief through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. Risk-taking in the quiet ending heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. No derivative or template elements.</comment>
