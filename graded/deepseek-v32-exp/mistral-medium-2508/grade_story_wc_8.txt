<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to uncover truth is clear and consistent, with embodied internal conflict (pulse betrays emotional rationality). His final choice to leave with the photograph is earned by prior causality, showing endurance with cost. Father Callahan applies effective secondary pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elias leaves with truth reconfigured, cost felt in confrontation and departure. Causal lens holds tightly; orientation anchored early. Persistent constraint of lies shapes tactics.</comment>
