<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and rooted in her sacred duty as a seed sorter; her transformation is earned through specific micro-choices like prodding the moonstone and building the monument, with visible cost in her physical change. Interiority is concrete and embodied, avoiding stock phrasing. The final choice to eat the leaf and transform is compelled by prior causality, foreclosing her old path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where Liora's role is redefined from sorter to part of the new grove, with cost legible in her bark-dappled skin. The accumulative/textural drive lens holds, building through patterns of seeds and leaves. Orientation is anchored early, and causality is coherent with key beats like the moonstone unfolding leading to the arbor's response.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor constrains choices by forcing Liora to climb and interact with it, charging the final image of the grove. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Liora's POV. The setting evolves causally with events, such as the roots forming a ladder, and integrates into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Liora's agency under the accumulative lens, from decoding leaves to transforming, with cost unmistakable in her physical alteration. The dominant stake of understanding the hush tightens through her proactive choices, and the resolution forecloses options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of transformation and story-sorting emerges through particulars like the seed tower and falling leaves, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "Prophecy was a seed," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the monuments crumbling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with a stable single POV and perceptual signature evident in Liora's noticing of singing seeds. Rhythmic control under pressure supports the accumulative drive, and any elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously, and rhythm varies naturally. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh, specific details like the moonstone key and floating arbor, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the transformation test passes with unique emotional specificity.</comment>
