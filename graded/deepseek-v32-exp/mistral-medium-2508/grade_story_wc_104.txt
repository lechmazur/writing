<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lena's motivation as a "chained liberator" is clear and consistent, driving her patient, strategic actions. Her micro-choices under pressure, such as using the poppy seed to distract the guard, reveal embodied emotion and hierarchy of values. The final planting choice is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in her stained hands and empty pockets. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; interiority is concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Lena plants seeds, reconfiguring the stakes with felt cost under a causal lens. The wall's fall signals her move, and key decoding drives the vault opening, with orientation anchored early. Cost is legible in the guard's trap and her purposeful scattering of seeds. The structure is tight, with one continuous scene and no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the abandoned carnival constraining choices (e.g., piano bench keys, duck-pond pit) and charging the final image of seeds in dry soil. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as the "yellowed like old bones" piano keys. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment shapes tactics without generic placeholder description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of planting resilience escalates under a causal lens through Lena's agency: wall fall triggers vault opening, guard confrontation, and seed scattering. Cost is unmistakable in the guard's trap and her emptied pockets. Pressure tightens meaningfully, foreclosing options without coincidence; the final choice to plant seeds reweights stakes with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges through particulars like seeds and the wall's fall, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "Not with a roar, but with a seed." Subtext operates in images and implication, such as the arrow's fletching symbolizing recklessness. No moralizing; emotional aftereffect is concrete and earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet consistent, reflecting Lena's strategic mind. Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure, e.g., short sentences during action. Minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., key decoding) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with varied sentence openings and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, such as "jagged scar of concrete." Momentum is maintained; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. No register drift or artifice in peak beats; closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of resistance, seeds, and carnival feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details like the arrow fletching. Emotional truth avoids generic templates; risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is fresh, and turns arise from character choice, not late rule changes.</comment>
