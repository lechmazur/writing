<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's deafness and emotional numbness are concretely embodied through actions like carrying the broken needle; his transformation is earned via the backward songs experience, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a hierarchy of values. The drum maker applies secondary pressure, and his final decision to teach feeling music forecloses his prior path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elias's numbness becomes a "door," with cost legible in the final image; the accumulative/textural lens holds, driven by sensory details and emotional shifts. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of deafness shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The cavern's damp earth and hides are vividly sensory and POV-filtered, constraining choice by isolating Elias; the phonograph and drum maker's hands charge the final image, with details like "vibrations traveled up his arms" integrating setting into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is defeating numbness, escalating through Elias's agency in engaging with the backward songs; a meaningful deepening occurs as he feels music, narrowing options and culminating in a decision with cost ("numbness was a door").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence as non-empty emerges through particulars like the needle and backward songs, with subtext in gestures; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the door image, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; rhythmic control under pressure is evident in lines like "the air thick with the ghost of rhythms," and elision (e.g., signed dialogue) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds; figurative language like "filament of hush" is coherent and purposeful, enhancing closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes deafness and music in a fresh, inevitable way; risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes, and specificity (e.g., backward songs) avoids template plots, with closure fully integrated.</comment>
