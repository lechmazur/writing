<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The knight's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., brushing the stem, unsnapping the gauntlet) revealing a hierarchy of values. His final choice to unsnap is earned by prior causality, foreclosing silence with visible cost ("it hurt like holy fire"). Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as his hesitation and eventual agency, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a decisive change (stepping onto the stage) with felt cost (his smile hurting), under an accumulative/textural lens that holds. The program discovery incites escalation, and threads reweaving as wings reconfigure options. Orientation is clear early, with who, where, and when anchored by ~120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse constrains choices (e.g., threads tightening around wrists) and charges the final image (glass panes clearing to reveal a stage). Sensory details are vivid and selective (smell of crushed silverleaf, pulsing light), woven through action with POV bias, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative/textural lens, from finding the program to unsnapping the gauntlet, narrowing options with cost legible (shadows spilling, pain of smiling). Dominant stake (silence vs. speech) tightens through threads and reconfiguration, foreclosing a path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images and actions (e.g., moth-banners as performance, unsnapping as transformation) without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("allegiance had never been to the silence") that reweights prior material, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure (e.g., "sound like a thousand needles dropping"). Voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful compression and elision taught early, paying off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and sentence openings. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful (e.g., "sky split like rotten silk"), without loops or scaffold issues. Read-aloud ear test passes, though some density may slightly challenge immediacy in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of knight, alchemical orchard, and performance tropes feels inevitable, transformed through specific choices (e.g., threads as manacles of light). Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure image recharges prior material with authenticity.</comment>
