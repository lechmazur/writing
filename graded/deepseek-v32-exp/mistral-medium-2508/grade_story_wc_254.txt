<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices that earn her transformation. The shift from seeking certainty to embracing fluidity is rooted in prior causality, with cost legible in the lake's thaw and her rewritten self.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual repricing as the atrium unfolds and Elira transcends boundaries, cost felt in the elders' fear realized and the lake's answer. Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with orientation anchored early and causality intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the quartz colonnade and frozen lake constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are filtered through Elira's POV, integrating action and atmosphere seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elira's agency under the accumulative lens, as her interaction with the quartz hum rewrites her and fractures the ice, with cost unmistakable in the unfolding atrium and transformed poets.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of boundaries and transformation emerges through images and events, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the lake's answer and paraphrased world. Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and rhythmic control under pressure. Elision is purposeful, and perceptual signature is character-specific, avoiding head-hopping while modulating with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and supports theme, and sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of poetry, transformation, and boundaries, with risk-taking in the accumulative style heightening stakes. Specific details like the cloud-shadow poet and quartz colonnade feel indispensable.</comment>
