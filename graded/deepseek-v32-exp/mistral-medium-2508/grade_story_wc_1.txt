<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and rooted in her adaptive nature, intensifying with the brother revelation. Interiority is concrete, but contradictory impulses could be more simultaneous in scene. The final renunciation is earned with visible cost when she lets the ledger fall.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Liora releases the ledger and steps into light, reconfiguring purpose with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong with pattern-building. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (canyon, frost) is vivid and selective, mirroring internal states and constraining choices. The frost patterns charge the final image and shape Liora's tactics. Sensory details are purposeful and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose/truth) escalates through Liora's agency in discovering the ledger and her brother's role. Cost is legible when she forecloses a path by dropping the ledger. Accumulative lens drives deepening with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images (frost, pauses, light) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and silence, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Lyrical prose is consistent and voice-motivated. Elision (e.g., pauses) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful in peak beats. Read-aloud test passes with clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of glass artist, ledger, and frost patterns feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details transform familiar tropes through character-driven choices.</comment>
