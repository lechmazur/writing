<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's characterization is deeply embodied with contradictory impulses (trembling hands vs. steadfast gardening), and her motivation to grow "unlikely things" roots in post-war trauma, compelling higher-stakes choices like the blood offering. Elias applies immediate pressure, and their relationship crucible forces a stance shift. The final renunciation of lockedness is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her accepting the second gauge tooth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative lens, with the final image of "the shape of an open door" reconfiguring meaning. Cost is legible in Lena's whispered command and the gleam of gauge teeth. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the harbor's rhythm pulsing as a promise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fire escape and harbor setting constrains choices (perch for moonlight, limited pots) and charges the final image with the basil straightening. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "moonlight silvering the water like a blade"), filtered through Lena's POV. Spatial choreography is coherent, with the ladder and pots tracking cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as density increase: the wilting basil, nicked thumb, and Elias's arrival deepen the stake of emotional healing. Protagonist agency drives the tightening—Lena's blood offering and acceptance of the second gauge tooth—with cost legible in the soil and shared moment. The final pulse reweights options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images (gauge teeth as keys, rosebush thorns) without direct statement. Subtext operates in gesture (Elias's sleeve brushing thorns) and implication. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to unlocking trauma through the "open door" image, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature in Lena's poetic noticing (e.g., "moonlight slanted here, sharp enough to carve shadows"). Dialogue is natural and subtextual ("Plants like iron"). Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in the hum and harbor breath, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated (e.g., "harbor breathed"). Read-aloud ear test passes with natural variation; no artifacts obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes post-war healing with lock-picking imagery in a non-obvious way, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in quiet emotional resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is transformed through specific details like the bitting gauge tooth and fire escape gardening, avoiding template plots.</comment>
