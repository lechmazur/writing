<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Summoner's motivation is clear and rooted in prophecy; interiority is embodied through actions like tracing water and unfolding the wing. Micro-choices under pressure reveal values, but lacks deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Earned stasis at closure with visible cost (cold searing, weight lessening).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is Earned Stasis with cost legible in "the prophecy’s weight had lessened." Orientation is clear early; causality is tight with one meaningful tightening. No plot amnesia or teleporting props.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposeful, with brook and origami wing constraining choices and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; details are filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hushing prophecy) is signaled early; escalation driven by summoner's agency under Accumulative lens, with cost visible in the cold searing and prophecy's transformation. One meaningful tightening forecloses options, but pressure could be more intense.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence calming fear emerges through images and motifs, not statement; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer with "the prophecy slept." Subtext operates in gesture and implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and rhythmic, modulating with pressure. No head-hopping; purposeful compression and elision are taught and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, clarity maintained in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mapping silence with origami wing feels inevitable; tropes are transformed through specific details. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; emotional truth is specific.</comment>
