<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. His final stand is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in death. Interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing as the cog endures, reweighting the narrative conflict with felt cost. Causal drive lens holds, with orientation anchored early. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, constraining choices (e.g., rising water, tunnels as vault). The cog charges the final image, and details are filtered through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under causal lens: Veyra's threat prompts Elias's hiding and confrontation. Cost is legible in his death, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of competing narratives emerges through events and images, not statement. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer with the cog "ticking," reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, and closure image is clear. No loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic preservation and personal rebellion feels inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
