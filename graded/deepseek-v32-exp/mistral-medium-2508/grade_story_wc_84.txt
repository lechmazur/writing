<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is clear and rooted in her sharp-eyed perception and hunger for belonging, driving her to take the chip. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion in lines like "her chest tightened" and the final handhold. The pilgrim's lesser development is acceptable in single POV, and their shared relief at the end earns the connection with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly: Lena's drone retrieval of the chip directly triggers the observatory's activation and constellation revelation. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost in the "dazzling, terrible relief" of connection. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the chip as a persistent constraint shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory details like "stone domes silhouetted" and "brilliant dimness," constraining choices as the observatory's structure enables the climax. The drone and chip function as micro-settings that alter tactics, charging the final image of the constellation etched between shadows.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding belonging escalates through Lena's agency in pulling the chip, narrowing options and forcing the pilgrim's reaction. Cost is legible in their shared relief and the reconfiguration of loneliness into connection, under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of missing pieces emerges through action and image, not statement, with subtext in the chip's pulse and the shared sky. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in "the shape of two people... finally seeing the same sky," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Lena's poetic, selective noticing. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, e.g., "her fingers stilled on the controls," and purposeful compression in the ending reinforces rhythm without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "sky threaded with the first stars" is consistent and purposeful, and propulsion remains clear through peak beats without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of drone tech and ancient mysticism feels inevitable, with specific details transforming tropes. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes, and the core concept of missing pieces is fully integrated through character and closure.</comment>
