<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The reaper's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. His heartbreak and desire to give fears shapes drive key turns, and the final choice to name monsters is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as the reaper's actions lead to monsters rising and his continued walk, with cost legible in his regret and the consequences. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like cracks in stone and scattered light that constrain choices and charge the final image. The observatory at dusk functions as a micro-setting that pressures tactics and enhances atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the reaper's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as he crystallizes fears and names monsters, narrowing options with cost felt in his regret and the echoed screams. The dominant stake of giving names to fears tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory, sacrifice, and naming emerges through events and images without direct statement, offering a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext operates in echoes and sacrifices, with complexity and emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful elision and no head-hopping, enhancing the narrative's texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with clear propulsion and no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the crystallization scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The concept is highly original, synthesizing tropes of reapers and fears through specific choices in character and world. Risk-taking in style and theme heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
