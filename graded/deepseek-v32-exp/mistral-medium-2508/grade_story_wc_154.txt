<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lena's characterization is deeply rooted in her past as a translator, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure; her "shrewdly innocent" trait enables her to decrypt grief, and her final action with the boy is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure coheres with a single scene; orientation is clear early, and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final image of glowing smudges reweights meaning with undeniable cost, mirroring Lena's role.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium and objects like the brain coral fragment are vividly specific, filtered through Lena's POV, and constrain choices—the coral's ridges ground her, and the setting charges the final image with atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake in healing grief escalates through Lena's agency, from decrypting the cast to unknotting the boy's photo; under the Accumulative lens, density increases with each interaction, and cost is legible in her physical pain and emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of translating pain emerges organically through images and actions, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the coral's weight and glowing smudges, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical yet controlled, reflecting Lena's expertise and stress, and dialogue (e.g., "I unknot them") is natural and advances plot with subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic but clear, with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts obscure closure, though minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "labyrinthine grooves mirroring the atrium’s archways") slightly reduces propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of translator tropes through specific, grounded choices in character and object use; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
