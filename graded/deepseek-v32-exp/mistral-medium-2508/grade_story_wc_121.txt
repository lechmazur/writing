<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to conquer his fractured self is clear and intensifies under pressure, embodied in micro-choices like tracing the rune and lunging. The merging scene shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, and the final wholeness is earned by prior causality with visible cost (tablet crumbling, gravity settling). No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Decisive Change under a Causal lens: the viaduct continues instead of resetting after Elias merges with his other self, with cost legible in "the weight of gravity finally settling." Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity, reinforced by the tablet's role shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The viaduct functions as a micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image (vanishing after use). Sensory details like "wet stone slick with rain" are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's POV to mirror internal states without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens, from tracing the rune to lunging at the other self, narrowing options and culminating in a merger with cost (tablet destruction). The dominant stake of self-conquest tightens meaningfully, foreclosing the loop with felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of self-unity emerges through events and images like fractured timelines merging, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Elias walking into dawn, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, using poetic compression ("darkening brightness") that heightens pressure without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping; voice modulates with emotional intensity, and any elision (e.g., procedural generation) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "fractured into jagged shards of light" is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes fractured timelines and self-conquest with specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure (procedural viaduct) heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
