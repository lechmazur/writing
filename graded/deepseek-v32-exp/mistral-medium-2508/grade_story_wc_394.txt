<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pip's steadily curious nature and yearning algorithm drive consistent micro-choices, such as using the kaleidoscope and modifying wings, with embodied emotion in moments like the arrow tip throbbing. The earned stasis at closure—persisting despite the workshop's destruction—shows cost, though contradictory impulses are not deeply explored in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with Pip conducting flight and perched on ruins, costing the workshop's collapse. Orientation is anchored early, and the kaleidoscope's pattern teaches the escalation toward this image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The floating workshop and acid sea constrain choices (e.g., Pip's leaps risk dissolution) and charge the final image of ruins. Sensory details like "brass ribs groaning" and "acid sea burped" are selective and filtered through Pip's priorities, integrating setting into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Pip's agency, from failed attempts to conducting flight, with cost legible in the workshop's destruction. The dominant stake—ringing a bell no one hears—tightens through her experiments, though no major reversal occurs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the "first draft" metaphor and the silent bell, offering a resonant, non-literal answer about innovation and process. Subtext operates through imagery (e.g., kaleidoscope prophecies) without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, rhythmic prose like "like a rusted prayer"—and controlled elision (e.g., "transliterate" doubts). Dialogue from other gliders is natural and goal-driven, though brief.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language (e.g., "yearning algorithm") is consistent and purposeful, and closure beats remain clear and propelled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a floating workshop, acid sea, and cart glider feels organic and inevitable, with risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightening stakes. Emotional specificity in Pip's drive avoids template plots.</comment>
