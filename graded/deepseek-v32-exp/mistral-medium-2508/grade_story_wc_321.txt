<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is strong with consistent traits and embodied emotions; her resilience and competence drive key choices under pressure, such as aligning the ferry and merging timelines. However, her internal conflict is minimal, leaning towards unwavering competence rather than contradictory impulses, which slightly limits depth. The final choice to merge timelines is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the ghosts solidifying and the hourglass filling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a conceptual repricing as the ferry merges timelines, reconfiguring meaning with felt cost (ghosts remembering both lives). The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through patterns and imagery. Orientation is clear early, and causality is maintained through Lira's actions, such as using the hourglass to stitch timelines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices, like the grotto's starlight patterns guiding alignment. Sensory details (bioluminescent algae, liquid silver water) are purposeful and integrated into action. The environment constrains tactics and charges the final image of the steady sky, making it indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the accumulative lens, with the radio warning tightening pressure and her merging act narrowing options. Cost is legible in the ferry shuddering and ghosts solidifying. However, the stakes, while clear, could have deeper personal friction beyond professional duty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transience and resilience emerges through images like the hourglass and merging lanes, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in Lira's dialogue ("Course is relative") and the final image of rising sand deepen complexity, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic diction reflecting Lira's perceptual signature ("constellations shifting like schools of fish"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, advancing plot. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., timeline names) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing atmosphere without muddle. Sentences advance story efficiently, e.g., "The water around them turned to liquid silver."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of commuting and timeline-hopping, transformed through specific details like the hourglass and grotto. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise feels inevitable in hindsight, supported by character-driven choices.</comment>
