<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's characterization is deeply embodied, with micro-choices like pressing her palms revealing hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation—letting the photograph go—is earned by prior somatic practice and internal conflict, with cost legible in the image of roots. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lena's release of the photograph reconfigures her stance with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds, reinforced by the cypress and sea imagery. Orientation is clear within 120 words; cost is unmistakable in the final leaf and empty pocket.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the arboretum and cliff constrain choice (e.g., the cypress branch catching the photograph) and charge the final image. Sensory details (salt wind, olive leaves) are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding cliché. Recurring objects like the stone wall mirror internal fractures.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict between grief and resilience) escalates under Accumulative lens through Lena's agency—releasing the photograph is a decisive tightening. Cost is legible in the somatic pain and imagined future. No coincidence; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: persistence of life versus loss is answered non-literally through the leaf and roots image. Subtext operates in gestures (smoothing the photograph, plucking the leaf). No moralizing; the ending reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply internal, with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "ghost of foghorns"). Voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping. Minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven. Elision (e.g., drone strike backstory) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("pearl of stillness") is consistent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with emotional beats, and closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in the non-obvious synthesis of trauma therapy, natural setting, and geopolitical violence. The somatic method and arboretum refuge feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
