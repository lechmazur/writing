<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's interiority and micro-choices under pressure are concrete, with embodied emotion (numb arm, pain as music). His final decision to give the bolt is earned by prior causality and contradictory impulses, foreclosing silence with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where safety is reweighted as choice, with cost legible in "the fortress answered." Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraint (silence) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (cobalt fortress, snow) pressures choices and charges the final image; the piano bench bolt as micro-setting constrains action and reweights meaning at closure, with selective sensory detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cost of safety vs. silence) escalates through Elias's agency under Accumulative lens; his choice to give the bolt narrows options with unmistakable cost (fortress trembles, guests react).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (silence, numbness) without moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via image and action, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful elision (e.g., "frostbitten hope") taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language ("snow... like notes on a broken scale") is coherent and propulsive, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes silence and safety with specificity; tropes are transformed through grounded choices (e.g., bellhop role, unpardonable silence), and risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
