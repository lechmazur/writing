<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and consistent, with interiority shown through concrete actions like hesitating before giving the spiral. Her final choice to write for herself is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the dream and the twig on her pillow. Contradictory impulses act in scene when she admits "It's not mine to give" but leaves it, demonstrating internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, with Liora's understanding of rejoining secrets culminating in her writing for the "space between the words." Cost is legible in the twig on her pillow and the dream dissolution. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with persistent constraints shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "damp wood" and "glistening domes" filtered through Liora's POV. The lotus temple and installation constrain her choices, and the thrush's nest spiral charges the final image. Micro-setting alters tactics, as the environment pressures her to rejoin secrets.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Liora's agency under the accumulative lens, moving from giving a client's secret to her own, deepening the stake in rejoining secrets. Cost is unmistakable in her dream and the physical twig, foreclosing paths with felt price. Dominant stake is signaled early and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as the orbs and the thrush's shadow, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Liora's writing and the dream, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures like the artist's steady hands and the monk's whisper.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature evident in phrases like "the clouds unraveling like yarn." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as with the artist's murmured lines. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure, with rhythmic control and purposeful elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent, such as "points of light that needed someone else to draw the lines," and propulsion is clear. Read-aloud test passes smoothly, with concise advancement of story and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of ghostwriting and public art, with specific details like the thrush's nest spiral transforming familiar tropes. Risk-taking in quiet narrative heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
