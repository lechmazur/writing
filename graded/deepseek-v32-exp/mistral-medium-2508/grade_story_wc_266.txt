<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and rooted in her history as a ferry guide, with interiority shown through concrete actions like pressing the punch into her palm. The final choice to stay is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her release of the tool. However, the epiphany moment feels slightly abrupt, though supported by reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible when Liora lets the punch go and joins the vigil. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with reflections deepening stakes. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the ridgeway and ticket punch constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "damp sand" and "vigil fires" are filtered through Liora's POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict between going and staying) escalates through dialogue and reflection, driven by Liora's agency. Cost is felt in her renunciation, foreclosing the path of crossing. Under the accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events, such as the unstamped tickets and the ridgeway, offering a non-literal answer on courage in pause. No moralizing; subtext operates in dialogue and silence, with resonance built from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, perceptual signature in selective noticing, and rhythmic control. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, advancing theme without head-hopping. Elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language like "lantern swinging like a metronome" is purposeful, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes ferry guides and vigil with a fresh angle on courage, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
