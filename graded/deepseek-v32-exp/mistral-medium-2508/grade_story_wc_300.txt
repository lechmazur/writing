<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inspector's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions like trembling fingers and hesitation. Her final choice to press the pearl is earned by prior causality, showing a decisive change from inspector to bearer of light with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The quick test is satisfied with contradictory impulses in scene and earned renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in "the weight of every confession became her own," reconfiguring the bunker as a womb. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through confessions and crystal pulses, leading to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is anchored early, and causality is intact with no breaks. The cost is legible on-page, and the lens is consistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "shattered quartz" and "bioluminescent crystal" throbbing, filtered through the inspector's POV. The caves and shells constrain choices and charge the final image, altering tactics. Economy is strong, with details integrated into action. The quick test is met as environment shapes the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake in finding the latent radiance escalates through accumulative density of confessions and crystal hums, driven by the inspector's agency. Her decision to press the pearl narrows options and forecloses her old path with cost. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, and cost is unmistakable in her transformation. The quick test is satisfied with agency-driven escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from confessions and images, exploring dissolution of walls between hearts without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in "The walls were never real," reweighting prior material. Subtext operates through implication and gesture. The quick test is met with a non-literal resolution that avoids abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and close third-person with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "acquiring abandoned hopes." Voice is poetic and rhythmic, modulating with pressure without head-hopping. Diction remains within the inspector's lexicon, and elision is taught and paid off. The quick test is satisfied with distinct voice and control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet clear, with varied rhythm and high information density, e.g., "veins of bioluminescent crystal that throbbed." No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Sentences advance story and atmosphere purposefully. The quick test is met with zero artifacts and clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic and mystical elements, transforming tropes via specific confessions and the pearl as method. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in structure and theme. Emotional truth avoids generic templates. The quick test is satisfied with non-obvious synthesis and heightened stakes.</comment>
