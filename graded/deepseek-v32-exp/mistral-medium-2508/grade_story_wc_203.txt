<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. His final decision to unmake the mechanism is earned by prior causality, showing a credible renunciation with visible cost as his hands shake.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—the shattered laugh and silence—under a causal drive lens that holds. Orientation is clear early, and the cracks as seams persistently shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting constrains choice and charges the final image; the circus office's sensory details, like dust and smells, are integrated into action, and the cracks directly enable the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the causal lens, from discovering the mechanism to unmaking it, with cost legible in the ghosts' fading and the weightless burden unwound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on liberation from performance without moralizing, reinforced by the final unwinding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice remains coherent under pressure, and elision (e.g., dust analysis) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and atmosphere, e.g., "dust motes hung suspended like tiny, forgotten acrobats."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes ghost-seeing technician and paused circus mechanism with specificity and risk, feeling inevitable in hindsight; originality heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
