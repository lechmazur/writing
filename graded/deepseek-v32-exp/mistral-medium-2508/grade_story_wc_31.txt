<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's obsession with the color of sound is concretely embodied through actions like wading into the shallows and using the key, with micro-choices under pressure revealing his hierarchy of values. The final choice to light the lantern is earned by prior causality, foreclosing his passive search with visible cost in the transformed world. However, internal contradiction is underdeveloped, with no simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where Elias's realization that sound's color is "made" reweights the premise, with cost legible in the waves' shimmer. The Accumulative lens holds, taught by pattern of discovery, and the library as crucible shapes the final image. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the door opening into the frozen festival serves as a meaningful cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The sunken library constrains choice by housing the key and door, charging the final image where Elias's lantern light threads new hues. Sensory details like "brine and old promises" are selective and POV-filtered, with spatial choreography coherent in the wading and door discovery. The setting evolves causally as the tide pulls the wreck deeper after the transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Elias's agency in finding the journal, key, and door, culminating in the lantern-lighting that reweights the stake of discovery. Cost is unmistakable in the dissolution of the figure and library, foreclosing his old path. However, the stake tightens primarily through accumulation rather than a decisive turn that narrows options earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the key's inscription "Luminous vows are not spoken, but shown" and Elias's silent vow at the end offer a resonant, non-literal answer to truth-seeking. Subtext operates in the figure's signed message and the frozen lanterns, avoiding moralizing. The conceptual repricing at closure reweights prior material without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "lantern swinging like a metronome." Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in the climax's cadence. The figure's signed dialogue carries subtext, and elision in the transition to the frozen sky is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences like "the colors bled into the air like ink in water" doing multiple jobs. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats; propulsion is clear through to the shimmering waves. Read-aloud test passes with natural modulation, and diction remains within the POV's lexicon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes the lamplighter's quest with the concept of synesthetic discovery in a sunken library, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and mystical tone heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The transformation of the "color of sound" from found to made through character choice avoids template plots.</comment>
