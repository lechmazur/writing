<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lysara's motivation is clear and rooted in grief for her brother, with embodied emotions (e.g., "hands trembled") and micro-choices under pressure (reaching for the jar). Her final decision to plant the seed is earned by prior causality, showing credible endurance with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise with cost (manuscript blank, seed gained), under a causal drive lens that holds throughout. The hour-long inversion creates a persistent constraint that shapes tactics, and cost is legible in the smudged print and swallowed scream.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory details (e.g., "serpentine grotto," "ozone scent") reflect POV urgency. The grotto's inversion and threshold directly constrain choices and charge the final image with the seed, integrating setting into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes (finding combinations for her brother) escalate under causal lens through agency (entering grotto, pressing manuscript). Cost is unmistakable in the threshold collapse and manuscript loss, tightening options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of seeking lost knowledge and grief emerges through particulars (brother's vision, seed in ashes) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the seed's potential, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature ("prism-mind," "clandestinely luminous"). Voice is lyrical and consistent, modulating with pressure; no head-hopping, and elision (e.g., manuscript's whisper) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm (e.g., "air ripped—not like fabric, but like a held note"), with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of magical realism with specific concepts (prism-mind, seeds of combinations) feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the premise is transformed through character-driven choices.</comment>
