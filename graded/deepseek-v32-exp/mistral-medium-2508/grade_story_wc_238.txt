<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in guilt and desire for reconnection, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to plant together is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the orchard's loss. Interiority is concrete, and flaws complicate choices, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (planting saplings after the orchard's destruction) under a Hybrid lens, with felt cost legible in the final image. The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and orientation is clear early. The ending reweights options with persistent constraints shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sheet music archive and orchard function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, filtered through Mara's POV. The environment subtly mirrors internal states and evolves with the plot, supporting the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency with the perfume, under the Hybrid lens, leading to a meaningful tightening where reconnection forecloses other paths. Cost is legible in the orchard's loss and the emotional weight of the apology. The dominant stake (apology and reconnection) is signaled early and deepens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect apologies and reconnection emerges through events and images without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the saplings and humming orchard, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV (Mara) is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Purposeful compression and poetic diction are taught early and pay off at closure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and no figurative muddle in peak beats. No loops or scaffold artifacts; diction is consistent and voice-motivated. The final image is charged without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The concept of a gossip-column exorcist and imperfect miracles is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in style and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details and emotional truth avoid template plots, with bold choices that cohere.</comment>
