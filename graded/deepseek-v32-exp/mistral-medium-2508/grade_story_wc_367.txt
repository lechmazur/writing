<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's characterization is deeply embodied with contradictory impulses—her laughter as a weapon, prophetic slips—and micro-choices under pressure, such as adjusting the wick, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the cyclical duty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise under an accumulative/textural lens; the cyclical resolution reconfigures meaning with felt cost in Liora's ongoing bargain. The lens holds without ambiguity, and the persistent constraint of the ritual shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse functions as micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Liora's POV to mirror internal states and pressure actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Liora's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in her prophetic slip and the storm's hunger. The dominant stake—guiding shadows versus dawn—tightens through her willed actions, foreclosing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical duty and control emerges implicitly through images and actions, resisting moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the charged poise of Liora's endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice exhibits a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, with stable POV and purposeful elision; the poetic diction reflects Liora's worldview without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates high information density and propulsion without loops or artifacts; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity and momentum in peak beats like the light's refraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality lies in a fresh synthesis of lighthouse keeper tropes with otherworldly stakes, transformed through specific character choices and risk-taking in tone; the concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
