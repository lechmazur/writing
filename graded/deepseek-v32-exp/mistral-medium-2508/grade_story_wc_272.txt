<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure leading to an earned renunciation. Her motivation shifts credibly from painting to embracing fragmentation, with visible cost in the final letting go. The final choice is rooted in prior causality, satisfying the quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Elara becoming the canvas. The accumulative lens holds, reinforced by pattern breaks like the tarot redesign. Orientation is clear early, and the lighthouse's final exhale makes cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image—walls closing in force Elara's action, and the library's groan recognizes her unmaking. Sensory details (salt, parchment) are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens, as walls close in and she redefines the tarot. Cost is unmistakable in her release of the box, foreclosing prior paths. One meaningful tightening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from fragmentation imagery, with the ending offering a non-literal answer through Elara's integration into the dark. Subtext operates via tarot symbols and library whispers, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct—poetic, perceptual signature biases notice toward decay and transformation. Elision (e.g., rhetorical questions) is taught and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language ("luminescent ache") coheres and heightens pressure without muddle. Read-aloud test passes smoothly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality lies in the non-obvious synthesis of lighthouse, library, and tarot into a fragmented reality concept. Risk-taking in accumulative structure pays off with inevitability, and the core premise feels fresh and indispensable.</comment>
