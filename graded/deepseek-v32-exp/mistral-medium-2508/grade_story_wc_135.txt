<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. His interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion like trembling from weight, not cold. The final choice to pass the valve is earned by prior causality, showing a meaningful change with visible cost in the silence embraced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elias passes the valve, reconfiguring meaning with felt cost in the absence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through fragments to a decisive image. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the harbor and valve constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful, like "slick cobblestones glistening," filtered through Elias's POV. The environment shapes tactics and supports the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation is driven by Elias's agency in collecting fragments and listening, reweighting stakes with cost. The dominant stake of silence deepens through his actions, leading to a legible price in the embrace of absence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to silence and memory without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like passing the valve, and the final image reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in Elias's lyrical, selective noticing. Voice modulates with emotional pressure, and rhythmic control heightens clarity. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle.
