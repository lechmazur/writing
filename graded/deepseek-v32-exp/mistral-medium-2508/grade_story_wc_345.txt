<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora's motivation evolves credibly from seeking respite to building it, with embodied interiority in key moments like hesitating to ring the bell. Kael's altruism is consistent and drives turns, though his ghostly nature slightly limits depth. The collective effort culmination feels earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure lands with resonant reconfiguration as "We stay" shifts from escape to building, cost legible in the planet's belief. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of collective action tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—floating arches, starlit fruit—and actively constrains choices, such as the cracks guiding Liora's actions and the bell charging the finale. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, enhancing atmosphere without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal quest to collective endeavor under accumulative lens, driven by Liora's agency in ringing the bell and tracing cracks. Cost is felt in the community's labor, though conflict remains low-key, fitting the tone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of building respite emerges organically through images like the chalk messages and watering bell, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material with a non-literal answer, though the "nebula of respite" concept is occasionally explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice; dialogue is minimal but natural. Elision in moments like the dream sequence is taught and paid off, maintaining coherence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and dense, with varied rhythm and no significant loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("ribs of a god") enhances without muddle, and closure image is clear and propelled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost story and collective effort tropes, transformed through specific details like the chalk messages and floating arches. Risk-taking in quiet escalation pays off, though not groundbreaking.</comment>
