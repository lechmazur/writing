<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The scribe's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses acting in scene (fear vs. nostalgia). His final choice to release the dream is earned by prior causality, culminating in the crack and chimes with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in the broken forecourt and elders' disapproval. Orientation is clear early, and causality is intact from petrichor trigger to orrery's release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image: the crystal forecourt cracks under his touch, and the sanctuary's hush thaws. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency: petrichor nostalgia unravels him, leading to cracking the crystal and retrieving the orrery. Cost is legible in the fracture and sound, foreclosing his prior silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images and action, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to silence vs. sound. Subtext in whispers as echoes of unfinished work avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "fractured whispers"). Poetic prose and rhythmic control under pressure heighten effect without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "quill like a bird"). Minor potential overwriting in peak beats doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of creator's redemption through specific details (crystal forecourt, glacial hush). Risk-taking in lyrical style pays off with inevitability in hindsight, transforming the abandoned dream trope.</comment>
