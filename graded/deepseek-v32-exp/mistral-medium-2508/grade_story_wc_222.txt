<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lirien's characterization is strong, with clear motives rooted in her master's legacy and a chivalrous code. Her interiority is concrete, shown through embodied actions like numbed fingers and calm dialogue under pressure. The final choice to leave the map and mend the sky feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the sky's reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot is tightly causal, with Lirien's mission driving the swap and confrontation, leading to a decisive closure where the sky begins to mend. The hybrid lens (causal/accumulative) holds, and cost is legible in the Keeper's realization and the spire's song. Orientation is clear early, with no disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is integral, with the ice spire and wrong sky constraining choices (e.g., slick ice scaling) and charging the final image of mending. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, like "black ice piercing the belly of the wrong sky," filtered through Lirien's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are dominant early (mending the sky/retrieving the lid), escalating through the swap and confrontation driven by Lirien's agency. Cost is unmistakable in the sky's transformation and Keeper's emotional shift, tightening under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of amending and embracing the unknown emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in dialogue (e.g., "time is a thing to be amended"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the mending sky and Lirien's open arms.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable single POV and perceptual signature (e.g., "stars moved like schools of fish"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in the exchange with the Keeper. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "laugh was the sound of cracking ice," accelerating with scene needs without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Story offers a fresh synthesis of thief tropes through specific world-building (wrong sky, ice spire) and character-driven choices. Risk-taking in lyric prose and conceptual repricing pays off, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
