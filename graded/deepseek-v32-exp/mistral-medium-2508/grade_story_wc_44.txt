<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in scholarly curiosity and defiance. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like "pulse quickened" and micro-choices under pressure, such as whispering "Relearn" and turning the key. The final choice to step through the light is earned by prior causality, foreclosing her old path with visible cost in the key turning to ash. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Decisive Change under a Causal lens, with Elara stepping through the light into a new world, reconfiguring options. Cost is legible in the key dimming to ash and the automaton's warning. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality is tight with because/therefore linkages from key discovery to action. The drive lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the observatory's brass dome and floating isle constraining choices as a lock. Sensory details like "cold metal" and "grinding voice" are filtered through Elara's POV. The key and automaton charge the final image, and world rules remain consistent. No generic placeholder or white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding the shadows) escalates under the Causal lens through Elara's agency, from inquiry to risking entry into the light. Cost is unmistakable in the key's destruction and her entry into the library of doors. Pressure tightens with the automaton's warning and the second keyhole, foreclosing options with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge and hunger emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in the automaton's dialogue and the final reconfiguration of "relearn the shape of hunger." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature in Elara's deliberate, scholarly voice. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as with the automaton's lines. Rhythm and diction heighten pressure without obscuring clarity, and no head-hopping occurs. Elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; metaphors like "stars pulsed like embers" are coherent. Register matches POV, and closure image is sharp. Read-aloud test passes with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes rune scholarship, reality-bending, and automaton lore into an organic whole, with tropes transformed through specific choices. The premise offers a fresh angle, and risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth avoids templates, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
