<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. Her final choice to restore the files is earned by prior causality, foreclosing her path with visible cost. Minor hairline slip: her emotional progression is strong but could show more contradictory impulses in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost (termination flag), and the causal drive lens holds without contradiction. The persistent constraint of the recurring numbers shapes tactics and the final image, with orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vivid and purposeful, with sensory detail filtered through Lena's POV. The patch and archive environment constrain choices and charge the final image, integrating seamlessly with action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lena's agency under the causal lens, with one meaningful tightening from discovery to restoration. The cost is legible on-page in her termination and the restored memories, narrowing options decisively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to memory and loss without moralizing. Subtext operates through the patch and numbers, with the final image reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature that reflects Lena's professional bias and emotional state. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision (e.g., the numbers' meaning) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is cohesive and purposeful, with clear propulsion and no muddle in peak beats like the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of corporate dystopia and personal memory, transformed through specific details like the neural lace and digital limbo. Risk-taking in structure and closure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
