<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Chen's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his belief in open secrets and directing flow. His final choice to leave is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the lighthouse going dark. Interiority is concrete, such as his thoughts on fortunes, and micro-choices under pressure reveal his values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the lighthouse's silence and Chen's departure. The hybrid drive lens (causal and accumulative) holds, with persistent constraints like the fortunes shaping tactics. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, as the lighthouse's isolation and the beacon's turn pressure Chen's escape. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, like the "ink still damp" and "wind carried the sound of an outboard motor," filtered through Chen's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Chen's agency under the hybrid lens, from writing fortunes to handling the microdot and escaping. Cost is legible in his foreclosed life at the lighthouse. One meaningful tightening occurs when the fisherman's daughter warns him, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of open secrets and transposing life emerges through events and images, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the dark lighthouse and continuing fortunes. Subtext operates in fortunes like "The tide will bring what you've already lost."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Chen, with a distinct perceptual signature in the lyrical, rhythmic prose. Elision is taught and paid off, as in the fortunes' recurrence. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present, like the fisherman's daughter's warning.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "the smoke curling like the question marks in his fortunes." Sentence rhythm varies naturally, supporting momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse keeper, fortunes, and spycraft feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the hybrid structure. Tropes are transformed through specific choices, like Chen's orchestration without being a spy. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
