<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his father's message, with interiority showing contradiction between skepticism and compelled action. His final choice to carry the truth is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the climax where he turns the valve wheel and accepts his role. Embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure are strong, such as his pulse jumping at the wheel's weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly from inciting incident to closure, with orientation anchored early. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing as Elias reweights the truth, carrying it with felt cost; the final image of him stepping into dawn reconfigures meaning. The valve wheel's role and father's confession create coherent linkage without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices, with the tunnel and valve wheel constraining action and charging the closure. Sensory details like "damp like a sleeping beast" and "scent of wet wool" are selective and POV-filtered. The environment shapes tactics, such as the sump water moving after the wheel turn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the truth—escalates through causal agency: Elias's appraisal and turning of the valve wheel force a confrontation with Luz, narrowing options. Cost is legible in the geyser scene and his decision to carry the wheel. Pressure coheres under the causal lens, with no coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of carrying truths emerges organically from events and images, like the valve wheel as "rosary stones," without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, such as the ghost shift representing swallowed histories. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Elias's acceptance, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, blending lyrical description and tense urgency. Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., "drowsy, alert second" during climax. No head-hopping; elision like the father's backstory is taught and paid off in closure. Rhythmic control enhances momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, as in "ribs of rusted track" and "fabric tearing." Sentence-level propulsion accelerates in peaks, and clarity is maintained even in dense beats like the apparition scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality lies in fresh synthesis of ghost lore with industrial decay, transformed through specific details like the valve wheel and swallowed thread. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with emotional specificity avoiding templates.</comment>
