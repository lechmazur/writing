<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Keeper's loose grip on reality is consistently embodied, and their renunciation of identity is earned through ritual, with visible cost in closure. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrases. No other characters, so relationship bullets don't apply.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is Earned Stasis with legible cost as keeper becomes "a witness, a fold, a breath." Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with pattern of refuge visits reinforcing theme. Orientation is clear early, and cost is on-page in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and constrains choice—the refuge enables witnessing, and library decay charges the final image. Recurring origami swan evolves in meaning. Micro-setting (refuge, river) actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative lens, escalation through density increase reweights stake of witnessing without judgment. Keeper's agency in ritual deepens cost of lost self. No explicit conflict, but internal stakes are felt and culminate in closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence and acceptance emerges through images and events, not statement. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer with "The silence was the answer." Subtext in objects like swan and refuge enriches without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature. No dialogue; elision is purposeful and paid off in closure. Rhythmic control under pressure, e.g., "their edges blurring," enhances texture without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and enhances atmosphere without muddle. High information density, e.g., "regenerative silence," advances story and character.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh angle on witnessing and silence. Specific details (origami swan, refuge) feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
