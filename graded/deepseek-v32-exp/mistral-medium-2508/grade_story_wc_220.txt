<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rook's motivation is clear and rooted in past trauma, with embodied emotions like "claws flexed" under pressure. His final choice to enter the dome is earned by prior causality, foreclosing his old life with visible cost. Interiority is concrete, though contradictory impulses are not strongly simultaneous.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration in the dome scene, cost legible in "the world outside was a scar." Orientation is clear early, and the cylinder's riddle drives a coherent structure with meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the scrapyard and dome constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "groaning metal" are purposeful, and micro-setting elements like the leaf integrate into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of connection escalates through Rook's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost unmistakable in his transformation. The riddle's path narrows options, and the final entry forecloses alternatives with felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of distance as wound/bridge emerges organically through images like the leaf and cylinder, with subtext in implication. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, lyrical rhythm, and controlled diction. Voice modulates with pressure, and elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is clear and purposeful, even in peak beats like the dome entry.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic tropes through specific choices like the bloodhound and phonograph, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
