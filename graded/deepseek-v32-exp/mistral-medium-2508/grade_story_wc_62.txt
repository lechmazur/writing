<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The carver's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. His internal conflict is shown through simultaneous impulses, and his final choice to carve hollows is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, and the spectral mentorship forces a stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the hollows carved and the daughter's initiation. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with patterns (butterflies, ribbon roll) intensifying to reconfigure grief. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the ending image reweights prior material without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse constrains choice and charges the final image, with sensory details (cracked glass, wet soil) filtered through POV. The setting pressures tactics via the butterflies' migration and the greenhouse as a lantern, and micro-setting (chisel, ribbon roll) alters options and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with the spectral mentorship and butterfly arrival deepening stakes. The cost is legible in the cracked stone and the hollows carved, forcing a trade-off from names to absences. One meaningful tightening forecloses an option with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images (hollows, butterflies) without direct statement, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to grief. Subtext operates in gesture and silence, and the final reconfiguration (carving hollows as a vessel) reweights prior material with complexity, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and elision (e.g., spectral hands) is taught and paid off. Dialogue, though sparse, is natural and goal-driven, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("wings like stained glass") is coherent and purpose-driven, and sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravestone carving, spectral mentorship, and butterfly migration feels organic and non-obvious, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure effect is inevitable in hindsight, with authentic emotional specificity.</comment>
