<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Poet's interiority is vividly rendered with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure; his transformation of the rope feels earned through prior texture-focused observations, and the final choice to carve the ladder carries visible cost in the burning hands and resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual repricing via the ladder image, reconfiguring choices with felt cost in the resonance and burning hands; accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, and orientation is clear early with grotto and rope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is immersive and tactile, with the grotto and rope actively constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the poet's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through poet's agency in engaging with the rope and energy beings; cost is legible in the resonant snap and transformation, under the accumulative lens that deepens the dominant stake of discovering texture and choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of impossible choices and texture of time emerges organically from events and images; the final ladder offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing, supported by subtext in the rope's evolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively poetic, with a perceptual signature focused on texture and pattern; rhythmic control under pressure heightens the narrative without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm with no loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the resonance scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Story offers a novel synthesis of concepts, with the ladder symbolizing an ingenious transformation of tropes; risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
