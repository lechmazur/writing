<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's grief is embodied through concrete actions and micro-choices, such as shifting from crafting wilted lilies to cranes, revealing a credible arc from mourning to generative teaching. Her internal conflict is dramatized without stock phrasing, and the final renunciation of burying grief in metal is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her transformed hands and open curtains.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Lena opens the observatory curtains, reweighting grief with cost legible in the "first stirrings of a seed." Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the pattern of motifs (stencil, cranes) pays off cohesively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image: the observatory's dome crack reveals the crane, and the curtain opening reconfigures possibility. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as the "copper so thin they trembled," avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens is driven by Lena's agency, from finding the crane to teaching others, with cost felt in her hands no longer aching. Dominant stake (internal grief) tightens through a meaningful deepening that forecloses isolation and opens connection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images like the artificial flower and origami cranes, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to grief without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures, such as leaving cranes for others, inviting reflection on transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical yet controlled prose under pressure. Rhythmic modulation supports emotional beats, such as the cadence shift when Lena "began to shape not another lily, but a crane."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language, like "grief coiled tight as the wire," is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of jewelry making, origami, and observatory setting, transforming grief tropes through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
