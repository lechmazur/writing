<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., fingers trembling). Final choice to leave the timer running is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in emotional reaction and seasonal change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as the echo is captured and timer left running, with felt cost in the warbled sound and seasonal turn. Inferred accumulative/textural lens holds, with patterns of light and sound building to climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory (marble cavern, cold air, light reflections), constraining choices and charging the final image. Environment pressures the protagonist through the ending season, integrating with action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing wonder) escalates under accumulative lens through protagonist's agency (reverse-engineering against time). Cost is legible in emotional weight and imperfect echo, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and wonder emerges through particulars (echoes, timer) without moralizing; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via the captured echo, reweighting prior material with emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (poetic, reflective voice). Prose rhythm and diction control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive with high information density; no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, even in peak beats (e.g., echo warbling), maintaining clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original premise of harvesting echoes is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in concept that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
