<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his desire to understand the building's whispers, intensifying to compel high-stakes choices like signing the contract. His internal conflict is embodied in hesitation before signing, and his transformation into the new tutor is earned with visible cost. Veyra's enigmatic presence consistently pressures Elias, creating a crucible relationship that alters both characters' states.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Elias becomes the new tutor, foreclosing his previous path with cost legible in the cycle's perpetuation. The causal drive lens holds tightly from curiosity to interrogation, with orientation anchored early. The persistent constraint of the seal and lies shapes tactics and the final image, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the antique desk and seal constraining choices and charging the closure. Sensory details like ink-stained fingers and wisteria vines are purposeful and filtered through Elias's POV. The rooftop garden during meteor showers pressures lessons and reweights the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from learning to interrogation, driven by Elias's agency in signing the contract and demanding answers. Cost is unmistakable as he inherits the tutor's role, narrowing options under the causal lens. The dominant stake is clear early and tightens meaningfully with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of lies as agreements emerges through events and imagery, not statement, with subtext in gestures like the seal's warmth. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Elias's cyclical role, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Complexity embraces ambiguity in the cost of knowledge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Elias's curiosity. Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot, as in Veyra's dry laugh. Rhythmic control under pressure is strong, though minor ornate phrasing doesn't obscure clarity. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "steam curling into forgotten letters" is purposeful and coherent. Sentences advance story and atmosphere seamlessly, and closure is undulled by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of magical realism and cyclical knowledge feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific choices like the seal's interrogation purpose.
