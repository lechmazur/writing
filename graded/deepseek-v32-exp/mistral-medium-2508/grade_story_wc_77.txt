<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lysander's motivation is clear and rooted in his cursed state, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His final choice to trick fear is earned by prior causality, with visible cost when he unspools the filmstrip. Minor weakness: the whispering advisor is off-page, but Lysander's agency drives the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal drive with clear linkages from inciting incident to closure, where Lysander's decisive change (pulling the filmstrip) reconfigures his relationship with fear. Orientation is anchored early, and cost is legible in the funhouse shuddering and mirrors weeping silver. The lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (burnt sugar, copper pennies) that pressure choices and charge the final image. The funhouse environment and mirrors act as micro-settings that constrain Lysander's actions, such as the rippling mirror that yields to his touch.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of overcoming fear escalates through Lysander's agency, culminating in his lunge through the thing to pull the filmstrip. Cost is unmistakable on the page with the funhouse's dissolution and his reflection winking. Under the causal lens, pressure tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of fear and self-deception emerges through events and images, not direct statement, with subtext in lines like "Fear isn't the dark. It's the hand that thinks it's holding the flashlight." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Lysander, with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in the exchange with the thing wearing his face. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with figurative language that serves pressure and clarity. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts obscure causality; sentences advance story and atmosphere seamlessly, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes cursed photographs and psychological horror with fresh specificity, transforming tropes through grounded choices. Risk-taking in style and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
