<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and micro-choices that reveal internal conflict. His final renunciation is earned by prior causality, though minor abstraction in peak emotional beats slightly reduces impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual repricing as Elias burns the ledger, with felt cost in his emotional release. The accumulative/textural lens holds, and the vandalized self-portrait as a map provides a persistent constraint that shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The archive setting is vividly rendered and constrains choices, with objects like the tapestry and key charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's POV to mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the accumulative lens, with stakes tightening through discoveries like the tapestry message and pillar inscription. Cost is legible in the burning of the ledger, foreclosing options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images and events, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the promise of memory and fire. Subtext operates in gestures like the key and ledger, avoiding moralizing while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Elias's interiority. Elision in reflection is taught and paid off, though minor register consistency in peak beats prevents higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with strong propulsion, though slight overwriting in metaphorical phrases like "volcanic tenderness" causes minor muddle. No major artifacts or loops harm clarity.</comment>
