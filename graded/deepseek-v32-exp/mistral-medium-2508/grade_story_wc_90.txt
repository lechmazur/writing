<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lien's characterization is deeply embodied and consistent, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., her trembling fingers during the final stitch) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her motivation to mend the tear is rooted in grief and endurance, intensifying through repeated attempts. The final choice to step through is earned by prior causality, with visible cost as she unravels. Interiority avoids stock phrasing, and emotions are concrete, such as her body humming with lightness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Plot under the Accumulative/Textural lens builds through patterned repetition of stitching, leading to a decisive change when Lien steps through the tear. Closure lands on-page with felt cost: her unraveling and the ship's disappearance. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The persistent constraint of the ship's failing gravity shapes tactics, and the cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices: the Eulogy's recycled hull and faltering gravity affect Lien's actions. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like the "faint shimmer of long-dried tears" charging the final image. The photograph as a micro-setting alters tactics and resonates at closure. Atmosphere supports the ghostly tone without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (opening the locked dimension) escalates under the Accumulative lens through Lien's agency, with cost legible as she unravels. The tightening from failed attempts to success with helping hands deepens pressure. Protagonist's endurance forecloses paths, and the final push carries a visible price. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of redemption through sorrow emerges implicitly from particulars like stitching and tears, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the child and green grass, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, such as the AI's whisper. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Lien's mindset. Voice controls rhythm under pressure, e.g., "The needle went in again. The thread held." Purposeful elision (e.g., the origin of the needle) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle; metaphors like "ship of bones" are consistent. Line-level craft supports momentum, and closure image is clear. Read-aloud ear test passes with purposeful syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes fresh concepts (ship of bones, shadow work) with emotional specificity, avoiding tropes. The premise is transformed through grounded choices, and risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight, with ingenuity in the stitching mechanism.</comment>
