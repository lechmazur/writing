<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's curiosity and rule-breaking are consistently embodied through actions like tracing charts and discovering the phrasebook; her final choice to lead the jump is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the crew's shifted skepticism and her new role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the ship breaking free from the loop, cost legible in the engine roar and starlings scattering; causal lens holds strong from discovery to resolution, with the hopscotch pattern as a persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice—the hopscotch board's glow is key to resolving the loop—and sensory details like "shifting shadows" and "trapped starlight" are selective and charged in the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Liora's agency under the causal lens, from noting patterns to convincing the captain; cost is unmistakable in the engine failure and crew's wonder, tightening stakes meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of light guiding the lost emerges through particulars like the phrasebook and hopscotch, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer in "the future felt luminous" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with lyrical precision ("clouds curled like ink on old parchment"); dialogue advances plot naturally, and elision is taught and paid off in the pattern discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high density and rhythmic control without artifacts; figurative language like "stranded luminance" is coherent and peaks in the closure beat, propelling momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of airship, starling murmurations, and magical hopscotch feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in lyric realism heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
