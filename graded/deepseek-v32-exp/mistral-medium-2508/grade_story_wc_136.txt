<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His final renunciation of solving mysteries is earned by prior causality, with visible cost when he admits ignorance about his sister.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elias accepts uncertainty, with felt cost legible in his whispered admission.

<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the starlit vault and cracks in pavement constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like mist and rusted metal are purposeful and filtered through Elias's POV, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the causal lens, from following cracks to confronting the truth. Cost is unmistakable when he relinquishes control, narrowing options and reweighting stakes with emotional depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of truth and grief emerges organically through events and imagery, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in the phantom train and platform deepens complexity.</comment>
