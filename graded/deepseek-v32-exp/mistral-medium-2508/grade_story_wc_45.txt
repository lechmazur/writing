<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Liora's forgiving skepticism is consistently embodied and drives key choices, such as not screaming at the tooth and bargaining with the changeling; her yearning to understand motivates the plot, and the final stance of "setting the world" is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the humming needle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from discovery to bargain; closure is a decisive change with resonant reconfiguration as the brother returns and the needle hums, indicating cost; orientation is clear within 120 words, and the well's constraints shape the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, from the "waxy green" hedge to the pulsing flowers; the garden and well constrain choices and charge the closure, acting as micro-settings that pressure Liora's actions and reweight the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding and restoring order escalates through Liora's agency, from offering the tooth to proposing the bargain; cost is legible in the changeling's transformation and the humming needle, tightening options under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of healing cracks emerges organically through the bone-setting metaphor and the image of turning wounds into stars; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice that modulates under pressure; perceptual signature is selective and character-specific, as in "a cleft in certainty," and dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language like "the garden sighed" is consistent and effective, and rhythm varies naturally without obscuring clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of changeling folklore with personal healing feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical magical realism heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the core premise is transformed through specific details like the bone-setting metaphor.</comment>
