<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's blithe nature and curiosity are consistently embodied through micro-choices like untangling the knots with calm determination. His final reset of the chessboard is an earned endurance that forecloses a path with visible cost, rooted in prior causality. No stock phrasing or diagnostic self-awareness undermines the characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise as Elias resets the chessboard, reconfiguring stakes with felt cost in the revelation of Hester's truth. The Causal lens holds via because/therefore linkages from knot-unraveling to escalating visions. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible in the pushed-away hand image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobalt silo and marigolds constrain choices by shaping the unraveling's atmosphere and charging the final image with the clicking door. Sensory details like "damp earth and rust" are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding generic placeholder setting. The silo's groaning ribs actively pressure Elias's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency in untangling each knot, narrowing options under the Causal lens with unmistakable cost in the widow's revealed motive. The dominant stake of discovering intentions tightens through each unraveling beat, forcing a trade-off that forecloses paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of intentions as knots emerges through concrete events like the tapestry's visions, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the chess metaphor and the final reset, reweighting prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Elias's poetic, soil-darkened voice. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in lines like "the knots shifted—not unraveling, but breathing." No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "breathing" knots is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the unraveling, maintaining clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of supernatural mystery and character-driven revelation feels inevitable, with risk-taking in poetic style heightening stakes. The tapestry concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in Elias's worldview.</comment>
