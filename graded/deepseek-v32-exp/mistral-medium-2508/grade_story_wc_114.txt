<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with embodied emotion (trembling hands, flinching at sounds) and micro-choices under pressure. Her final decision to step into the storm is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost as she dissolves into the wind.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost felt in her vanishing footprints and the storm's arrival. The Accumulative drive lens holds through imagery and internal reflection, and orientation is clear early with who, where, and when anchored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the weather station and storm atmosphere pressuring choices (e.g., barometer's fall, illustration on table). The environment constrains tactics and charges the final image of Liora stepping into the storm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (to warn or not) escalates under the Accumulative lens through density increase in internal and external signs. Protagonist agency drives the climax with cost legible in her dissolved weight and the station's fate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of certainty vs. margins emerges from events and images (e.g., smudged illustration, occupying margins) without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Liora's silence and the storm's inevitability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful elision (e.g., "Perhaps she had never said it at all") that pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, even in peak beats like the climax, advancing story and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in a fresh synthesis of the oracle trope with specific setting and moral calculus. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
