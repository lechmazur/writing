<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The bell tuner's patience and deliberate actions are consistently embodied, with micro-choices like steady footsteps revealing his values under pressure. However, interiority lacks contradictory impulses, and emotional depth is more endurance than conflict, limiting peak characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost felt in the endless work ("the work was not done—it never would be"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with the archway's settling and child's laughter reweighting stakes through gradual sensory accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices—the cobblestones warm underfoot, the archway groans—charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding generic description while mirroring internal states through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the Accumulative lens through the tuner's agency (walking, striking the fork), deepening as the town responds. Cost is legible in the ongoing duty, though the escalation is more textural than causal, with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of balance as a sustained act emerges organically from images and actions, not statement. The ending's non-literal answer ("Balance... was a thing you kept") reweights prior material without moralizing, supported by subtext like the whispering voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic rhythm and perceptual signature ("his breath steadied, his steps growing surer"). Purposeful elision and compression serve the accumulative design, and minimal dialogue feels natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though occasional density in peaks ("the wild hush of a place holding its breath") slightly risks clarity without harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh specificity—revival via sound rhythm—feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional truth avoids sentimentality.</comment>
