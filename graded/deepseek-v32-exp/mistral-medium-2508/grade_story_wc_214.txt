<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in spiritual curiosity and patience. His internal conflict between societal dismissal and personal belief is embodied in micro-choices, such as tracing stars and ignoring alarms. The final choice to accept the star's light is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his raw laughter and departure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost: Eli's transformation and the station's rebirth are legible in the final image. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory details and emotional shifts. Orientation is clear early, and causality is maintained without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "metal ribs groaning" and the lantern glass constraining choice and charging the final image. The station's isolation pressures Eli's actions, and the environment evolves causally with the starlight veins.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Eli's agency under the accumulative lens, from tracing stars to empathizing with the meteor. The cost is legible when he risks being broken and gains transformation. Dominant stake (connection in stillness) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as stillness yielding growth and vulnerability as strength. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though the line "strength wasn’t in armor" is slightly explicit but earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, reflective voice that modulates under pressure. Perception is character-specific, and minimal dialogue feels natural. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity and momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The concept of a cosmic janitor finding connection is a fresh synthesis, transforming tropes through specific details like the lantern glass. Risk-taking in quiet narrative heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
