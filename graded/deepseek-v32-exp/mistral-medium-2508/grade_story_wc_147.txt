<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and rooted in guilt, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. Her final renunciation is earned by prior causality, and the cost is visible in her changed perspective. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as overriding the instinct to flee.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost, under an accumulative/textural lens that holds. The persistent constraint of time and oxygen shapes tactics, and orientation is clear early. Cost is legible in the final image of her selling gear and moving inland.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the underwater temple and perfume vial constraining choices and charging the final image. Details are selective and purposeful, integrated into action and perception, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with time pressure and the dying signal tightening stakes. The cost is unmistakable in her use of the perfume and subsequent transformation, foreclosing options with visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and acceptance emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures like unsnarling the chain. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Prose is lyrical and consistent, reflecting Liora's state, and any elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and vivid imagery. No loops or scaffolds obscure closure; figurative language is cohesive and enhances peak beats without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of "gathered hush" is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style heightening stakes. Emotional specificity avoids templates, and the premise is fully committed to without derivative echoes.</comment>
