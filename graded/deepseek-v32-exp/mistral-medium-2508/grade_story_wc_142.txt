<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elira's dual allegiance is concretely embodied through micro-choices like recalibrating her breathing and spraying graffiti, with internal conflict driving her stance crystallization. The final choice to build a "third world" is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the city's movement and her pressed chip.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in "the city was learning to move before the walls could close in." The hybrid causal-accumulative lens holds, and the foundation chip's reprise charges the ending. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (graffiti on plywood, clocktower transformation) and charges the final image with the raft city's fluidity. Sensory details like "acrid tang of frying dough" are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elira's agency under the hybrid lens, from spraying the mural to planning the clocktower, narrowing options with cost in the dawn surveyors' threat. The stake—saving Lumina—tightens through reorganizing actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of building bridges emerges from particulars like graffiti encoding messages and the clocktower sundial, with the ending offering a non-literal answer through "caught between two worlds, but building a third." No moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a poetic, perceptual signature ("drunken dream," "chaotic pulse"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, and elision (e.g., graffiti mechanics) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, and syntax varies naturally under pressure, e.g., "The mural complete, she pressed the foundation chip."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of gentrification resistance through graffiti-based reorganization feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the raft city setting and hybrid structure. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world.</comment>
