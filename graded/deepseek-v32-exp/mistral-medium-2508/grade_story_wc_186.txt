<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices (e.g., tracing star paths) revealing hierarchy of values. Retrocognition trait is integrated as a genuine flaw that compounds loneliness, earning the final endurance. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; interiority remains character-particular and contradictory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration where the beacon's flare reveals "the shape of the past" with conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored early; star paths and prism fractures form a taught pattern that pays off at closure. Cost is legible in the final image of "thistle-blown moment" and the custodian's renewed purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image: the glass pavilion's hum guides action, and the prism's fractures shape tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., "salt wind," "worn glass"), filtered through POV bias. Micro-setting (star paths) functions as an environmental pressure that alters options.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens, with one meaningful tightening as she presses the prism, igniting the beacon. Dominant stake (proving coincidences have meaning) is signaled early and deepens through cost—her loneliness and the physical effort. Resolution is earned through her alteration, foreclosing despair with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of meaning in fractures emerges through particulars like the prism mending and star paths aligning, without direct statement. Subtext operates in gesture and image (e.g., "shard of hush" pulsing). Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material, embracing complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and consistent, modulating with emotional intensity (e.g., "humming" to "singing"). Purposeful compression (e.g., "thistle-blown hope") is taught and pays off. No head-hopping or register drift; diction remains within the custodian's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated (e.g., "silence so deep it made her teeth ache"). Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the climax, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality lies in the non-obvious synthesis of retrocognition, post-collapse setting, and "shard of hush," transforming familiar tropes through specific detail. Risk-taking in lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry. The combination feels inevitable in hindsight, with authenticity of vision.</comment>
