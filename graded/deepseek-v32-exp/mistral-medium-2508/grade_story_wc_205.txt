<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his poet-revolutionary background; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, and his final choice to use the shard is earned by prior causality, showcasing micro-choices under pressure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal hybrid lens with clear orientation; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the shard's destruction reweights time's beauty, with cost legible in the dust image and the archaeologists' shifted perspective, adhering to scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with the asteroid cathedral and time-strands constraining choices; the storm and mirrors charge the final image, and sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early with the archaeological dispute; escalation is driven by Elias's agency using the shard during the storm, leading to a legible cost (shard destroyed) that tightens options under the hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the vase shard and time-strands, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on memory vs. excavation; subtext operates through imagery and implication without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is consistent, and dialogue (e.g., with Taelis) is natural and goal-driven, advancing plot without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control; no loops or scaffold artifacts, and figurative language ("time-strands glow like embers") is coherent and purposeful, enhancing momentum without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes sci-fi and archaeological themes with fresh specificity; tropes are transformed through grounded details like visible time-strands, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
