<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The fisher's cool-headedness and grief are embodied through specific actions under pressure, such as voicing silence and digging, with his final choice to let go earned by prior causality and visible cost when the garden blackens. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. Micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values, and the endurance forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with the fisher's silence commanding the goddess and the constellations snapping into place, costing the blackening of the garden and the release of his daughter's echo. The drive lens holds consistently, and orientation is clear early with the sound wave garden and restless constellations. Cost is legible in the final image where the echo is let go.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The sound wave garden and rail spike function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like the hum of the earth and the smell of river reeds integrated into action. The environment pressures tactics, such as digging where the soil refuses to hum, and the rail spike's evolution from hook to tool deepens the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the fisher's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with his voicing silence and digging tightening the stakes toward confronting the goddess. The cost is visible when the garden screams and blackens, foreclosing the option of holding onto his daughter's echo. Pressure coheres through pattern breaks and cadence shifts, reweighting the emotional stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of grief and letting go emerges through images and events, such as the rail spike trembling and the final release of the echo, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the fisher's endurance and the feral lullaby, reweighting prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the world through the fisher's professional and emotional lens. The prose has rhythmic control under pressure, with purposeful compression and elision (e.g., "voiced silence") taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold issues; figurative language like "teeth made of broken echoes" is coherent and serves the atmosphere. Sentence rhythm varies naturally with the emotional intensity, and there are no artifacts obscuring causality or closure in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements—sound wave garden, sleepwalking constellations, voicing silence—feels fresh and organic, transforming tropes through specific grounded choices. Risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the emotional specificity avoids generic templates, making the closure inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
