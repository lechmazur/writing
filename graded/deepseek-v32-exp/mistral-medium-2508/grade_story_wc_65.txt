<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's motivation as an ignorance cartographer is clear and consistent, driving her actions from start to closure. Her internal state is embodied (e.g., "fingers numb but her mind alight"), and the final choice to complete the map is earned through prior causality, with cost felt in the spire's response. However, contradictory impulses are not deeply explored in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with on-page cost in the spire's song and the world feeling "softer at the edges." The Accumulative lens holds, building through imagery and mood. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure is coherent with a single shard, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The obsidian spire and frozen lake are integral, constraining choices (e.g., the ice as a record) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Liora's POV. The setting actively shapes tactics and closure, elevating the score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes of seeding innovation escalate through Liora's agency under the Accumulative lens, from hesitation to bold strokes. Cost is legible in the risk of overstepping and the spire's transformative response. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ink lifts and settles, foreclosing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of innovation through listening, not control, emerges organically from events and images (e.g., kingfisher metaphor). The ending offers a non-literal answer ("planting a question") without moralizing, reweighting prior material with resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and rhythmically controlled. Elision (e.g., predictive modeling) is taught and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift, even under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and vivid imagery (e.g., "ink spread like a bloom"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; information density is high. Rhythm supports emotional beats without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The concept of ignorance cartography is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical approach heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details (e.g., comet ink) anchor universals, and closure integrates fully.</comment>
