<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's characterization is deeply embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing her hierarchy of values—salvaging purity from wreckage. Her internal conflict about letting go is shown through concrete actions, like handling the locket, and her final endurance feels earned. The widow's grief is similarly specific, avoiding stock phrasing. Minor hairline slip: the mother's memory could be more dramatized, but it doesn't undermine closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lena accepts the cyclical nature of grief, cost legible in "the dead, for once, were quiet." Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through imagery and emotional density. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the glacier's presence persistently shapes tactics. No causality breaks; the widow's revelation and Lena's reflection interweave seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glacier shrine and melted snow globe are indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image with tactile specificity. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, like the candles' light "pooling in the glass like liquid gold." Atmosphere mirrors internal states without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lena's agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from the widow's grief to her own salvaging, with cost unmistakable in the widow's "hope" and Lena's unresolved past. Dominant stake (emotional truth) tightens through a meaningful deepening. No coincidence; turns arise from character choices. The final image reweights options with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—the snow globe, locket, and glacier—offering a non-literal answer to salvaging light from wreckage. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, like the widow's tears rearranging the glass. No moralizing; the ending resonates through image and implication. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature that reflects Lena's world-weary yet hopeful stance. Syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional pressure, e.g., "The glacier sighed." Dialogue, though sparse, feels natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing multiple layers without padding. Figurative language is consistent and clear, e.g., "voices the color of old silver." No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Read-aloud test passes with varied syntax and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of ghost-whispering, glacier setting, and melted snow globe feels fresh and inevitable, transforming familiar tropes through specific, grounded details. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity and conceptual integrity are maintained throughout.</comment>
