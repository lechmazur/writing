<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure; the conjurer's motivation to understand grief through mathematics drives key turns, and his final acceptance of ambiguity is earned with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as his attempt to preserve versus the realization that some things can't be, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost ("some equations weren’t meant to balance"), under the Accumulative/Textural lens held throughout; orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of ambiguity shapes the final image. Cost is legible in the damp imprint and clouded eye, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the cavern orchard and mosaic stepping stone constraining choices (e.g., dovetailing eyes) and charging the final image; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, enhancing atmosphere. The environment actively pressures tactics, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, through actions like dovetailing eyes and whispering incantations, leading to a deepening that reweights stakes with cost (e.g., illusion dissolution). The dominant stake of coping with loss tightens meaningfully, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of ambiguous loss emerges organically through images and events, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer ("remembered—not as they were, but as they might have been"); subtext operates in gestures like the glass eyes weeping, avoiding moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from particulars, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and purposeful elision (e.g., the wife's note) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffolds; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with no muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level rhythm supports the accumulative design, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of concepts like mathematics of emotion and taxidermist's eyes, transforming tropes with specific choices; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The non-obvious integration feels inevitable, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
