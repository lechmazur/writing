<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation to transmute pain into art is clear and consistent, driving her choices. Her perceptively calm demeanor is embodied in micro-choices, such as waiting for the light shift, and her final act of taking the photo is earned by prior causality. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with no stock phrasing. The closure choice forecloses a path with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost when the photo is taken and its impact implied, reconfiguring the town's grief. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with patterns of imagery escalating to the final image. Orientation is clear early, and the closure cost is legible in lines like "the click echoed softer than the factory’s ghost-whistle, but it carried farther." No causality breaks or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the lavender field and factory ruins constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "scent of crushed lavender and old iron" are filtered through POV, and the environment guides the archivist's tactics. The setting evolves consistently, and spatial choreography is coherent. Quick test passed as environment alters tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of collective healing escalates under the accumulative lens through the archivist's agency, culminating in the photo that reweights pain into art. Cost is legible in the transformation and implied community impact. One meaningful tightening occurs as she waits for the light shift, foreclosing other options. Escalation is driven by protagonist choices with visible cost, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of transforming pain into art emerges coherently from events and images, not direct statement, with subtext in gestures like the photographs forming a "constellation." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final photo, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and avoids sentimentality. Quick test passed with undeniable resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature, evident in phrases like "like a breath held too long." Rhythm controls pressure, and any elision is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present. No head-hopping or register drift. Quick test satisfied with cohesive voice under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, as in "photographs fan like wings," without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats. Quick test met with zero loops and clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept is original, synthesizing archival work with collective healing in a non-obvious way that feels inevitable. Specific details like the dove gray case and photograph arcs heighten stakes without gimmickry. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulative design pays off with coherence. Quick test passed with fresh synthesis and risk that enhances clarity.</comment>
