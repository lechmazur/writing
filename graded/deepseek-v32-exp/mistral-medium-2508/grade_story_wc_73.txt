<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's grim optimism is consistently embodied through her persistence and final choice; interiority is concrete with dice and pain as anchors; the decision to not step through the door is earned by prior causality and reconfigures her understanding with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost felt in turning back; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pattern buildup; orientation is clear early; the chipped die as persistent constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The infinite staircase constrains choices and charges the final image; sensory details like gray haze and dice clatter are selective and POV-filtered; micro-setting (dice) alters tactics and supports theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens: density increases with dice throw and pattern break; agency drives the turn (running sideways); cost is legible in forfeiting the smooth die and continuing the climb.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of perpetual motion as choice emerges from events and images; ending reweights prior material without moralizing; subtext in dice and door offers resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (mathematical, introspective); voice modulates under pressure; no head-hopping; elision (e.g., backstory) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold issues; figurative language ("gray haze peeled back like fabric") is coherent and purposeful; clarity maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mathematical recursion and psychological quest; tropes transformed through specific details (dice, staircase); risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; emotional truth in missed opportunity.</comment>
