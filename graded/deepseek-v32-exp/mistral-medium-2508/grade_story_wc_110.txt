<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. Her eavesdropping and drawing arise from consistent traits and past experiences, earning her final clarity with visible cost. The couple's brief presence applies immediate pressure, and Lena's contradictory impulses (e.g., not meaning to eavesdrop but acting) are dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost as Lena achieves clarity and the couple understands without words. The accumulative lens holds, building through imagery and emotional density. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of the lens shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt and rain-soaked setting are vivid and purposeful, influencing choices through acoustics that carry sound and light reflections. The lens functions as a micro-setting, constraining perception and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Lena's POV, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lena's agency under the accumulative lens, as her eavesdropping leads to the decisive act of drawing, reweighting the stakes of communication. The cost is legible in the couple's relieved reaction and Lena's internal shift. One meaningful tightening deepens the emotional stake without multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions, such as the lens warping light and doodles conveying truth, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to honesty and perception. Subtext operates in silence and implication, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material without statement, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; Lena's lyrical, reflective voice controls rhythm and diction under pressure. Purposeful compression and elision (e.g., the couple's muffled dialogue) are taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with poetic but clear figurative language that accelerates emotional beats. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts obscure causality; sentences advance story and atmosphere efficiently. Read-aloud test passes with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The concept of non-verbal communication through doodles and a cracked lens is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in quiet narrative heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specific details (e.g., the concert ticket) avoid derivative premises.</comment>
