<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is clear and rooted in loss, with interiority shown through concrete actions like tracing the censer foot. Her internal conflict between past and present is embodied, and the final lightness feels earned by prior causality. Micro-choices under pressure, such as answering the phone and building maps, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in "the weight in her chest felt lighter." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through patterns of calls and maps. Orientation is anchored early, and the structure coheres with a meaningful tightening that reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "rusted antennae" and "salt wind" filtered through Lena's POV. The censer foot functions as a micro-setting object that constrains choice and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear, and details integrate into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of navigating loss is signaled early and escalates under the Accumulative lens through cryptic calls and map-building. Protagonist agency drives escalation, with cost legible in the final lightness. One meaningful tightening forecloses options and reweights stakes without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of loss and solace emerges organically through images and actions, not statement. Subtext operates in gestures like the censer foot "listening" and calls guiding reverse migrations. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in Lena's lyrical, biased observations. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Voice modulation under pressure is controlled, and elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, advancing story without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief and navigation tropes through specific details like the censer foot and reverse migrations. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with emotional specificity avoiding templates.</comment>
