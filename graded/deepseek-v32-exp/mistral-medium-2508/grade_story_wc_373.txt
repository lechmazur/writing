<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is clear and rooted in revenge for her father, with interiority shown through concrete actions like clutching the fob. Her micro-choices under pressure, such as laughing to crack Veyne's composure, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation—walking away without violence—is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in her carrying the memory. Contradictory impulses act in scene, balancing calculation with emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change: Lena captures the sound of trust breaking, and Veyne faces the tide's justice, costing her peace but enabling rest. The causal drive lens holds tightly, with events linked by because/therefore logic (e.g., false starts lead to Veyne's realization). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of market rules shapes tactics. Cost is legible in "the harbor would take what it was owed."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "salt-bleached planks" and "tar and stolen rum" filtering through Lena's POV. The pirate market pressures choices through its rules, altering tactics. The fob as a micro-setting object constrains choices and charges the final image with reweighted meaning. Economy of detail ensures momentum without postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of revenge is signaled early and escalates under the causal lens through Lena's agency, using false starts to corner Veyne. The tightening occurs when she laughs, triggering the trust-breaking moment with unmistakable cost. Protagonist-driven escalation narrows options, and the cost is legible in Veyne's downfall and Lena's internal burden. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of debt and trust emerges implicitly from events and images, such as the fob dangling "like a noose." Subtext operates in gesture and implication, like Veyne's smile not reaching his eyes. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Lena's peace with "the breaking," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in Lena's poetic, gritty voice. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext (e.g., "You're late" / "So was my father"). Rhythmic control under pressure varies syntax purposefully, and any elision (e.g., the tide's justice) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats; metaphors like "promise curdled into a lie" are coherent and purposeful. Read-aloud flow is smooth, and closure image remains sharp without artifact obstruction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of revenge tropes with unique elements like hunting the "sound of trust breaking." Specific, grounded choices in character and setting transform familiar material, and risk-taking in the quiet, conceptual closure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
