<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and rooted in her sensory map abilities, with interiority shown through concrete perceptions. Her final choice to step through the seam is earned by prior causality, and the relationship with the man adds depth without overshadowing her agency. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, though the cyclical spontaneity trait is more stated than deeply conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with tight because/therefore linkages, from finding the shard to the seam's redirection. Closure is a decisive change as Liora steps through, rewriting her map with felt cost. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the shard as a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid with sensory details like "rusted girders" and "ozone," selectively filtered through Liora's POV. The repair bay and shard constrain choices and charge the final image, integrating environment into action. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve with the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes around discovering truth escalate through Liora's agency, from pocketing the shard to facing the seam. Under the causal lens, pressure tightens with each beat, and cost is legible in the map's reconfiguration. The final choice forecloses paths with visible cost, driven by protagonist action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of weaving truths emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures like the shard's transformation. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the map's endless nature, avoiding moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, such as the seam's pulsing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Liora's sensory maps. Voice is poetic yet controlled, with rhythmic prose that modulates under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision (e.g., seam redirection) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful, as in "groaning like bones," and clarity is maintained even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports the narrative drive without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of parallel worlds and sensory mapping, transforming tropes through specific choices like the shard's evolution. Risk-taking in structure and prose heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
