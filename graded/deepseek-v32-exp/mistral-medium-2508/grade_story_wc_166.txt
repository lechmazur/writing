<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and rooted in elective exile; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., trembling fingers). Micro-choices under pressure, such as pressing moonstone dust, reveal hierarchy of values. Final choice to fledge is earned by prior causality with visible cost of separation from the sea.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she becomes "the gap itself"; cost is legible in "the sea would rise and fall without her." Inferred accumulative/textural lens holds, with pattern of silence and gaps teaching early. Orientation is clear within first 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective (e.g., "blackened pond where waterlilies curled like clenched fists"); twilight garden and pond constrain choice by supplying reflection for the ritual. Sensory detail is purposeful and charges the final image of the verse as a map.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transformation through fledgeing escalates under accumulative lens via density increase in the ritual process. Protagonist agency drives escalation (e.g., dipping fingers for Orion's reflection), with cost unmistakable as the ink "bit deep" and her skin is "no longer hers alone."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of exile and home emerges through events and images (e.g., "exile was just another word for a door left ajar"); subtext operates in implication without moralizing. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material, such as the cosmic verse as a confession.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and single with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "the stars above leaned closer"). Voice is poetic and controlled under pressure, with purposeful compression and rhythmic variation. No head-hopping; elision taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated (e.g., "like a blade unsheathed"). Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, supporting accumulative intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (tide dancer, moonstone dust, cosmic ink) feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; specific details like "spontaneously anchored" dust transform familiar tropes.</comment>
