<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his quest for unused love, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. His transformation is earned through prior causality, and the relationship with the woman, though brief, forces a choice that alters his state. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; interiority is concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost: Elias becomes the keeper of sparks, reconfiguring meaning. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through imagery and emotional depth. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the cost is legible in the final image of his shadow whole and the viaduct blooming.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the viaduct and jasmine scent constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, integrating into action. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment pressures Elias's discovery of the jade and his revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding unused love escalates through Elias's agency with the jade and camera, narrowing options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible in his shadow splitting and reuniting, foreclosing his prior state. One meaningful tightening occurs when he presses the jade, revealing the truth with felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images and events, not statement, with subtext in breaths and shadows.

Emotional aftereffect is concrete and earned through specifics like the river's embers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful compression and elision taught early. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in the woman's revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythm and no loops or artifacts.
