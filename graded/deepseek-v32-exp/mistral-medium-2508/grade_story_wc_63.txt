<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in guilt, with concrete interiority shown through embodied emotions and micro-choices like carving names and adjusting the clock. His final decision to continue carving is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the villagers' reactions and his ongoing struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost as the village notices the chime's change and Elias persists; the accumulative/textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early. The cost is legible in the final image of villagers pausing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the tidal obsidian ridge and clock tower constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details like "salt-spray" and "wet iron and kelp" are filtered through POV and enhance atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the accumulative lens, with his carvings and clock adjustments deepening stakes; cost is legible in the villagers' regrets and the splintering rake handle, though the escalation is subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of incremental absolution emerges through events and images like the carved names and lagging chime, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext operates in gestures and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is controlled and rhythmic under pressure, with purposeful elision and no head-hopping; prose reflects Elias's mindset consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and cohesive, and rhythm supports the story without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the quiet, reflective tone heightening stakes; the core premise is transformed through specific detail and character choice.</comment>
