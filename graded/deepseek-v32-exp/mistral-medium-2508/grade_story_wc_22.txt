<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Coachman's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through concrete actions like cradling seed pods and mimicking birds. Micro-choices under pressure, such as scattering seeds and whispering old words, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, though contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration under accumulative/textural lens; the garden's persistence reweights meaning with felt cost in the final image. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. Persistent constraint of the land's hunger shapes tactics throughout, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the jetty and battlefield constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "slick with twilight" and "taste of salt and sorrow" are filtered through POV, integrating environment into action. Spatial choreography is coherent, and micro-setting elements like seed pods alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of land reclamation escalates through coachman's agency under accumulative lens, with cost legible in the transformation from sorrow to sweetness. Meaningful tightening occurs as seeds are scattered, foreclosing options and deepening the theme. No coincidental resolutions; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of renewal after death emerges organically from images and events, such as seeds pushing through rot and poppies leaning toward the sea. Subtext operates in implication, like the "slow, green vengeance," without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the garden's memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical syntax and rhythm that heighten pressure. Voice is consistent, with purposeful compression in phrases like "the jetty exhaled." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, as in "syllables curling from his throat like smoke." Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of renewal tropes through specific, grounded choices like the coachman's dead language and bird-call method. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with transformation via lived detail.</comment>
