<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's characterization is deeply embodied with contradictory impulses (stillness vs. scream) under pressure; her final choice to teach whittling is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the raw scream and shared bouquet, foreclosing passive grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the scream and remade hush; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through patterned silence and action; orientation is clear early, and constraints (grief, silence) shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (wind turbines, farmhouse) constrains choice and charges the final image; turbines as "indifferent gods" and the bouquet as micro-setting evolve under pressure, with sensory detail selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens is driven by Lena's agency (scream, teaching whittling), tightening stakes from passive grief to active coping; cost is legible in the scream's rawness and the burned happiness tin.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of remaking silence emerges from events and images, not statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("hush felt like a choice") that reweights prior material without moralizing, supported by subtext in gestures and objects.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and rhythmic ("slow, indifferent gods"), modulating under pressure; dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has zero loops or scaffold, high information density, and clear propulsion; figurative language is purposeful and consistent, with no muddle in peak beats like the scream; rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in fresh synthesis of post-dystopian grief and personal remaking; specific details (whittling, happiness tin) feel inevitable, and risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
