<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through concrete actions like tracing the prism. His final choice to destroy the prism is earned by prior causality, demonstrating a credible endurance with visible cost when he walks away empty-handed. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as his initial belief in echoes versus the shocking realization that objects give back emotions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Elias destroys the prism, causing the frost to melt and symbolizing release, with cost legible in the "clean, sorrowless streams." The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory details to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early, and the plot coheres without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The quartz arbor and car window frost constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like "fractured rainbows" and "cold bite" being selective and purposeful. The environment pressures Elias's communion and resolution, integrating seamlessly into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the accumulative lens, from communing to the vision and prism destruction, narrowing options with cost visible in his trembling hand and the prism's shatter. The dominant stake of proving object absorption deepens meaningfully, foreclosing a path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of echoes and letting go emerges naturally through events and images, such as the prism's destruction reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in the frost patterns and prism's hum, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature evident in Elias's selective attention to silence and frost. The prose has rhythmic control under pressure, and any elision (e.g., the vision) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax, with no loops or artifacts obscuring clarity. Figurative language like "skeleton of light" is cohesive, and momentum is maintained through concise, purposeful sentences that advance story and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of objects absorbing and returning emotions is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and specific details like the quartz arbor create a memorable perspective.</comment>
