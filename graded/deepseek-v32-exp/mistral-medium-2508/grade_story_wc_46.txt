<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Liora's motives are clear and rooted in grief and tradition; her embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure feel earned, though some reflection borders on summary rather than simultaneous contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost in the girl's "white knuckles"; the Accumulative lens holds, reinforced by the mist's retreat and the sea glass's pulse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The grotto's serpentine mist and sea glass function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes around preserving light escalate through the girl's arrival; Liora's agency in passing the sea glass narrows options with visible cost, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of becoming light emerges through particulars like the pearl of stillness and sea glass; the ending offers a non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature in noticing light and stillness is consistent, and elision in memories is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts obscure closure, though some metaphors are rich but coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of light and stillness tropes through specific character and setting; risk in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
