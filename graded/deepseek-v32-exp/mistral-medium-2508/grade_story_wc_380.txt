<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final endurance (Earned Stasis) is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the dissolution of tools. Minor hairline slip: internal conflict could be more contradictory in scene, but overall strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost on-page ("the stone shook itself apart... wildflowers had crumbled to ash"). Inferred hybrid lens (dominantly causal) holds without contradiction, and orientation is clear early. Persistent constraint of gravity shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory-selective, with the salt crystal chamber constraining choices and charging the final image. Micro-setting (stone, wildflowers) functions as environment that alters tactics. POV bias filters details purposefully, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under causal lens, with cost unmistakable in the loss of stone and flowers. Dominant stake (recovering memories) tightens through meaningful turn in the chamber, foreclosing options. Pressure coheres and grows until final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with ending offering resonant, non-literal answer (memories are stored, not deleted) that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in implication, avoiding moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic and character-specific, with elision (e.g., gravity's nature) taught and paid off. No head-hopping; prose reflects focalizer's mind state.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with clear propulsion and no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purpose-driven, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Minor density in metaphors but clarity maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise offers fresh synthesis of gravity pockets and memory excavation, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific, grounded choices transform tropes through character and world logic.</comment>
