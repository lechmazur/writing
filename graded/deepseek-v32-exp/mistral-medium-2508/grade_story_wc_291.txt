<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's face-blindness and methodical nature are concretely embodied, driving his choices; his internal conflict and awakening empathy are earned through specific micro-choices, such as whispering Liora's name and sealing the memory, with visible cost in his "methodical heart a little less still."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost as Elias carries Liora's memory; causal lens holds tightly from the ribbon's arrival to the vision, and the quarry's history as a wound persistently constraints tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The quarry setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "damp walls" and "mist curled like a held breath" filtered through Elias's POV; it pressures his investigation and mirrors internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency with the lance under the causal lens, narrowing options to witness the echo; cost is legible in the lance sealing the memory "like a brand," foreclosing vengeance for witness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of witnessing versus vengeance emerges through echoes and images, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the sketch and ribbon, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is rhythmic and controlled under pressure, with purposeful elision like "the dark whispered back" taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "the quarry kept its secrets" is coherent and heightens peak beats without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of face-blind artist and supernatural cold cases feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric prose and echo mechanics heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes through specific detail.</comment>
