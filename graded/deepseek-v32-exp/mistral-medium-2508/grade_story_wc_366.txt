<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elias's motivation evolves credibly from reticence to engagement, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. His final decision to stay is earned by prior causality, such as the ritual with the sea glass and letters, demonstrating a decisive change with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with Elias's choice to stay reconfiguring isolation into connection. The cost is legible in lines like "the skiff would rot at the dock," and the lens holds without ambiguity, supported by patterned escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lantern room setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details like "rust and old wax" filtered through Elias's POV. Recurring objects like the sea glass and stones evolve tactically, deepening atmosphere and stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate meaningfully under the Accumulative/Textural lens through Elias's agency, such as burning letters then engaging with the stones. The cost is felt in his renunciation of departure, narrowing options and reweighting safety as connection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions, such as the sea glass representing "safety wasn't the absence of storms," without moralizing.

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with a stable POV and rhythmic control under pressure, as in "the stones humming like a choir of held notes." Purposeful elision and perceptual signature enhance coherence without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language, such as "like a man tracing a scar," is precise and advances momentum, avoiding obscurity at closure.</comment>
