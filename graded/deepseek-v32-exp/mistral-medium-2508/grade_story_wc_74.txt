<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The painter's motivation to prove kindness is remembered is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied actions like the "methodically hopeful" exhale. His final choice to sleep is earned by prior causality, and micro-choices under pressure reveal his values. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; contradictions like insomnia versus steadiness are handled in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost (brush worn down, smog thinned), under an accumulative/textural lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the structure builds patternically to a decisive change. The cost is legible in the final image, and persistent constraints like insomnia shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is essential, constraining choices (greenhouse as refuge) and charging the final image with sensory specificity (smog, jasmine, moonlight). Details are filtered through POV, and the environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism. The brush and fig tree function as micro-settings that alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving kindness is remembered) escalates under the accumulative lens through the child's laughter, which deepens pressure and leads to the painter's sleep. Agency is clear in the decision to write the laughter, with cost legible in the brush's wear. One meaningful tightening forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images (lost languages, brush gift) without direct statement, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to kindness and memory. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, and the ending reweights prior material without moralizing. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature that reflects the painter's mindset. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and elision (e.g., the calligrapher's absence) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction and rhythm control heighten pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, advancing story without muddle. Sentences propel momentum, and the closure image is sharp. Read-aloud test passes with natural variation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of insomnia, lost languages, and kindness, with specific details that feel organic. The premise is non-obvious, and risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test: the arc is inseparable from its particulars.</comment>
