<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and rooted in her illness and devotion, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., refusing to wither and working on the orchard). Interiority is concrete, and her final endurance is earned with visible cost. The relationship with Tomas adds depth, and flaws are present without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (Tomas taking up the work) and resonant reconfiguration (sapling's response and diary line), with felt cost under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, shaping tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details (e.g., "stone pillars breathed," copper wire warmth) that constrain choices (sapling's location) and charge the final image. The temple orchard and living pillars are integral to pressure and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Elira's work against elders) is signaled early, with escalation driven by her agency (wrapping copper, confronting Tomas) under the causal lens. Cost is legible in her death and the sapling's response, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of symbiosis and respect through bending emerges from events and images (e.g., copper wire as marriage, final diary line) without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, offering a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (poetic, attentive to nature) and rhythmic control. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (e.g., Elira's correction to Tomas), and elision is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful (e.g., "brittle hinges," "leaves trembled"), and clarity is maintained even in peak beats, supporting propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality lies in the specific synthesis of living architecture and interspecies symbiosis, feeling organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and details are particular to voice and setting.</comment>
