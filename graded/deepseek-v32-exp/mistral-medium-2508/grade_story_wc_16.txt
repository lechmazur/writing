<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in penance, with interiority shown through embodied emotion (trembling quill) and micro-choices under pressure. Her final action of singing is earned by prior causality, demonstrating contradictory impulses of recklessness and calculation. The cost is felt in the inkwell's destruction and her personal renewal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the archive alive and Elara stepping forward, reconfiguring stakes under a Hybrid lens. Causality is tight, with her actions leading to the inkwell's shattering and chorus restoration. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the shattered inkwell and transformed archive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The archive setting constrains choices through time pressure and supplies resources (scrolls, inkwell), charging the final image with sensory vividness. Details like "crushed violets" and "indigo mist" are purposeful and POV-filtered, evolving with the action to mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring truth escalates under Hybrid lens through time pressure and Elara's agency, culminating in her singing choice that narrows options. Cost is unmistakable in the inkwell's destruction and the archive's transformation, foreclosing the path of destruction with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of truth as a bridge emerges through events and images like the inkwell revealing obligations, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the chorus playing, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in silences and implications.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful compression in peaks. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., harmonic gaps) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, avoiding muddle in peaks. Sentences advance story efficiently, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of language as promises and the inkwell's truth-revealing properties, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming tropes through specific details.</comment>
