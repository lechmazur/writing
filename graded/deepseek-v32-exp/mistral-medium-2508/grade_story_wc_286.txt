<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The potter's phototropic kindness and embodied micro-choices under pressure (e.g., embedding the lantern glass) create a credible arc; his final understanding of resistance as remembrance is earned through prior causality with visible cost in leaving the bowl.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the glowing bowl and potter's walk away, anchored by early orientation and fractured timelines shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (sun patterns guide navigation) and charges the final image; sensory details like "hives split open like old wounds" are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding genericism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by potter's agency under accumulative lens (bee's thrum, glass embedding) tightens stakes; cost is unmistakable in the forfeiture of the bowl and realized understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of resistance as remembrance emerges through particulars (lantern glass, bee) without moralizing; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via the glowing bowl and potter's insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; lyrical compression ("the air thick with the ghost of honey") is taught and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with no loops or scaffold; figurative language ("glaze shimmering like the last breath of a dying star") is coherent and purposeful, maintaining clarity under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fractured timelines and craft transforms tropes; risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
