<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot with embodied emotions like "her voice raw with smoke and wonder." However, internal contradiction is minimal, and the final choice, while earned, lacks deep conflict or flaw-driven struggle, limiting complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with cost—stars returning symbolizing hope—under an accumulative/textural lens. Causality is clear from Liora's actions to the climax, and orientation is anchored early. The mosaic's message "Defy the weight" charges the ending without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "blossoms that glowed faintly" and "dust that smelled of crushed lavender," constraining choices and charging the final image. The fortress acts as a micro-setting that pressures Liora's actions and enhances atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes of defying hopelessness escalate through Liora's agency, such as lighting the fireworks, with cost legible in the sky's transformation. Under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres through density increase, but the conflict resolves neatly without persistent constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of light as memory emerges through images and events, not statement, with subtext in lines like "Light isn’t just for seeing. It’s for remembering." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though it leans slightly explicit at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, reflected in rhythmic prose like "petals like embers caught in slow motion." Perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., the mosaic's discovery) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise and vivid with strong imagery, varied syntax, and no loops or artifacts. Read-aloud rhythm is effective, though minor density in metaphors like "vines of liquid fire" slightly risks clarity but doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The combination of fireworks designer and cursed fortress feels fresh, with tropes transformed through specific details. Synthesis is non-obvious, but risk-taking is moderate; it lacks the indelible originality for higher bands.</comment>
