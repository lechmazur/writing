<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyssa's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure tracing her realization that the books want release. Her final decision to give the pendant is earned by prior causality, foreclosing her role as guardian with visible cost in the unraveling world. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as hesitation before embracing uncertainty, scaling the cost to the length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, with closure as a Conceptual Repricing where the garden unravels into a "vast, breathing page," reweighting reality with felt cost in Lyssa's laughter and the weight lifting. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the pattern of thinning walls and homesick books pays off at closure. No causality breaks; the pendant's hum and figure's arrival tighten options coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—frozen garden, mist, skeletal trees—and constrains choices, such as the pendant half-buried in thawing soil prompting Lyssa's key decision. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, like "hungry cold" between stars, charging the final image of unraveling. Micro-setting (the book, pendant) actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release vs. preservation of knowledge) escalates under accumulative lens through density increase, from whispered books to the figure's demand. Lyssa's agency in giving the pendant drives a meaningful tightening, foreclosing her old life with cost legible in the world's dissolution. No coincidental resolution; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—homesick books, boundaries of light—offering a resonant, non-literal answer at closure: "the other side of light" like a friend. Subtext operates in gesture and image, such as the spiral pendant symbolizing cyclic consumption, without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from Lyssa's struggle with uncertainty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, rhythmic prose reflecting Lyssa's stressed perception ("time had gone slippery"). Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., short, stark sentences at climax. Purposeful elision (e.g., "since the fire") is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, e.g., "mist inhaled" accelerating the climax. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and closure image is sharp without muddle. Read-aloud test passes with elegance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of homesick books and boundaries of light feels inevitable in hindsight, transforming tropes through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the final reconfiguration carries authentic emotional truth. No derivative echoes; freshness is indispensable.</comment>
