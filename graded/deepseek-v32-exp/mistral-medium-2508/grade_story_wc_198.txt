<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and embodied in the struggle to hush the prophecy; internal conflict shown through micro-choices like playing to unmake sound; earned endurance with cost in the lingering note and return to the grotto.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the prophecy's hum and note; accumulative/textural lens holds throughout; orientation is clear within first lines; persistent constraint of prophecy shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices (grotto resists, prism weeps rainbows) and charging the final image; sensory details like damp stone and mist are purposeful; micro-setting (saxophone) actively used in beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of hushing prophecy escalates under protagonist agency through playing and resistance; cost is legible in the prophecy's linger and return; one meaningful tightening occurs with the face emergence and final phrase.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence and struggle emerges subtextually from events and images; ending offers a non-literal answer ("some hungers were never meant to be filled") that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and poetic rhythm; purposeful elision (e.g., prophecy in code) is taught and paid off; no head-hopping; voice modulates with pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language (e.g., "breath curling like smoke") is coherent and supports atmosphere; clarity and propulsion maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of prophecy, silence, and music feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative structure and quiet climax heightens stakes; specific details (e.g., prism atrium) avoid tropes through grounded execution.</comment>
