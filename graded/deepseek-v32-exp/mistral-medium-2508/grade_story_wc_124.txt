<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's characterization is concrete with embodied emotion and internal conflict; his final choice to leave is earned by the causal revelation about the flowers feeding on his grief, with visible cost in his departure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost as Elias leaves the greenhouse; causal lens holds tight with because/therefore linkages from uncorking the vial to realization and action; orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the greenhouse and ultraviolet light constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details are selective and filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the causal lens, from unsealing the vial to realizing the flowers' true nature, with cost legible in his abandonment of the greenhouse and past.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory and grief emerges organically through events and images; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer as Elias stops "walking through doors" of scent without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic with stable POV; perceptual signature is character-specific; rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats like the realization scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is original with a non-obvious synthesis of grief and supernatural elements; risk-taking in lyrical magical realism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
