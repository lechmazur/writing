<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lysan's motivation to preserve wisdom is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority (feeling the parapet's pulse) and micro-choices under pressure (consecrating the parapet). Her endurance is earned with visible cost ("weight in her chest eased"), and the half-mask symbolizes her honesty without overt exposition. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws are balanced with competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Lysan holds the clearing "long enough," a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear early (who, where, when), and the lens holds without ambiguity. The parapet's song fading and borders steadying provide a decisive change with felt cost, shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details (crushed mint, warm metal) filtered through POV. The kinetic parapet and pavilion constrain choices and charge the closure, as Lysan's interaction with them alters tactics and outcomes. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve with the scene's pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving wisdom) escalates through Lysan's agency in consecrating the parapet, narrowing options under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in her effort and relief, foreclosing paths with visible trade-offs. Pressure coheres and deepens without coincidence, driven by protagonist choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through events and images (whispers vs. fire, wisdom in spaces), with a resonant, non-literal answer in the ending's "echo of wisdom." Subtext operates in silence and implication, avoiding moralizing. The final image reweights prior material without statement, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; prose is lyrical and consistent, modulating with emotional intensity. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (e.g., voice from pavilion), and elision is purposeful. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is integrated without muddle (e.g., "like breath through reeds"). Sentences advance story and atmosphere; clarity is maintained even in peak beats. Read-aloud test passes smoothly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of prophecy and wisdom preservation, with specific world-building (kinetic parapet, clearings). Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, and risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with no derivative echoes.</comment>
