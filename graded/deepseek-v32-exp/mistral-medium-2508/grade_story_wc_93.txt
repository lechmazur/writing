<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and rooted in her curse, with interiority shown through concrete actions like tracing sand and placing rocks. Her final endurance is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in her bleeding hands and understanding of her role. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as knowing shifts before they happen, driving her choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (earned stasis) with felt cost when Liora accepts her duty to keep placing rocks. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through patterns and dust to a decisive change. Orientation is clear early, and the promise's revelation reweights prior material without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is integral, with the tidal bluff and aurora pressuring choices and supplying resources like the dust and rocks. Micro-setting elements constrain actions and charge the final image, as seen when the dust shivers and the sequences glow. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Liora's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Liora's agency under the accumulative lens, from searching to harnessing the dust, with cost legible in her bleeding hands and the world tilting. The dominant stake (fulfilling the promise) tightens through her actions, foreclosing other paths and leading to the eels' return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images and events, such as the dust remembering stars and patterns as anchors, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the promise's meaning, reweighting prior material with complexity. Subtext operates in gestures like the unraveling reflection and the eels' etched spirals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical prose and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is consistent, with purposeful compression and elision taught early, such as in the pattern of knowing shifts. No head-hopping; diction matches Liora's worldview and stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "pulsed like a dying heartbeat," without muddle in peak beats. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, advancing story and atmosphere with concision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines through a specific synthesis of elements like eel herding and star dust, transforming tropes with grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight. The premise is fresh and fully committed, with emotional specificity.</comment>
