<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, rooted in his desire to restore voice to the city. His micro-choices, like inviting Lira in, reveal his values with visible cost. Interiority is concrete, such as when his breath catches at the girl's arrival, showing embodied emotion without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change: Elias disappears, but the phrase spreads, reconfiguring the resistance with cost (his sacrifice). The causal lens holds from broadcast to girl's arrival to collective action. The final image of dust waiting and listening charges the ending with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices: the ember alcove serves as a hideout, and the mist "listens," affecting tactics. Sensory details like "scent of damp paper" and "radio's glow" are selective and purposeful, integrated into action. The alcove and radio charge the final image with atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from solo broadcasts to shared risk with Lira, driven by Elias's agency in letting her participate. Cost is legible when he leaves everything behind, narrowing options. The dominant stake of free expression tightens through a meaningful turn that forecloses his safety but amplifies the message.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of resistance through storytelling emerges organically, with subtext in dust whispering and radio pulses. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the spreading phrase, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars like Lira's declaration about blue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Elias, with a distinct poetic voice that modulates under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as when Lira whispers, "The dust told me." Elision is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language, like "mist coiled thick as regret," is coherent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates during climax, such as Lira's broadcast, without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of dystopia, music, and magical realism feels inevitable, with specific details like the dust speaking transforming tropes. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is fresh and fully committed, avoiding derivative patterns.</comment>
