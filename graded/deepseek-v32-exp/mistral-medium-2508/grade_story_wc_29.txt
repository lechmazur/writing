<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her cautiously hopeful heart. Her final choice to continue engaging with the signal is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost when the dean seeks her. Interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing, and flaws complicate choices without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with because/therefore linkages, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the signal changes and the university's divisions feel like scars. Orientation is anchored early, and closure lands with cost legible in the air thrumming with something unspoken. The inferred lens holds without ambiguity, and persistent constraints shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the radio station and astronomical charts constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Liora's POV, such as the static hissing and charts smudged with frequencies. The environment pressures decisions and evolves causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving agency against cosmic forces) is signaled early and escalates through Liora's interference, driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens. Cost is legible on-page when arguments falter and the signal wavers. One meaningful tightening occurs as her actions force a change in the signal, with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through events and images, such as the signal's pattern mirroring social fractures, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the shifted signal and scars metaphor, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in rhythmic control and diction that matches Liora's expertise. Dialogue, when present, is natural and goal-driven. Purposeful compression, like the description of the signal, is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language, such as "static hissed like a nest of angry stars," is coherent and voice-motivated. No artifacts obscure causality or closure, and diction remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of cosmic signals and human social dynamics, transformed through specific details like the frequency alignments. Risk-taking in blending genres heightens stakes without gimmickry. The non-obvious angle feels inevitable in hindsight, with emotional specificity avoiding templates.</comment>
