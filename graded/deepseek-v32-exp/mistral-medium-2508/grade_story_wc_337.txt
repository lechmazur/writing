<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elias's characterization is deeply specific, with calloused fingers and silence accumulation embodying his trade and internal state. His final choice to let the net unravel is earned through prior causality, showing contradictory impulses between restoration and release. The cost is felt in his transformation into a "door," foreclosing his old path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration under an accumulative lens, as Elias's unraveling leads to spirits freed and prisms shattered. The cost is legible in the townsfolk's changed perception and Elias's new role. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary and fisherman's net function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image, with sensory details like "splintered rainbows" and "stench of kelp" filtered through Elias's POV. The net's unraveling directly shapes the climax, making the setting indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the accumulative lens through Elias's agency, as his decision to not fix the net narrows options and forces a trade-off between illusion and relief.

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the net as a "lie" and Elias becoming a "door," offering a non-literal answer on acceptance without moralizing. Subtext operates through imagery and silence, with complexity in the drowned's relief resisting tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature evident in phrases like "accumulated silence."
