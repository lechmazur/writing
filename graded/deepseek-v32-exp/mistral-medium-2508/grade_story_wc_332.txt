<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied with clear motivation; the librarian's hesitation and final choice to let the dream stay are earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the dream's dissolution. Internal conflict is shown in scene, not summary, and micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation forecloses a path with felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot operates under an accumulative/textural lens, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the librarian's choice to preserve the dream's ephemeral beauty carries conceptual cost. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The cost is legible in the "footstep, half-erased by the tide," and persistent constraints like light timing shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the archipelago and black sand constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are filtered through the POV, and the environment pressures actions, such as the light refraction for vitalizing. The watercolor palette as a micro-setting alters tactics and reweights the closure, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled with the dream's capture, and escalation is driven by the librarian's agency through failed and successful vitalization attempts. The choice to let the dream stay narrows options with a visible cost in its fading. Under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres and tightens with a meaningful deepening that forecloses a live option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of preserving ephemeral beauty emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in the dream's hunger and the librarian's conflict. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the "luminous absence," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature; the poetic voice modulates with emotional intensity but remains consistent. Rhythm and diction control under pressure, such as in the climax where prose compresses without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping or unmotivated elision; all experimental choices are taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats like the dream's whisper. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and clarity is maintained throughout. No artifacts harm closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines through a non-obvious synthesis of dream-capturing with light, transformed by specific details like the watercolor palette and archipelago. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, and the closure effect is legible with conceptual cost.</comment>
