<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. Her internal conflict is shown through contradictory impulses, such as her bleak exhilaration during the climax. The final choice to hunt rather than fix the past is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal-accumulative hybrid lens with coherent linkage; closure is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights potential with cost. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the geode's role shapes tactics. The ending image of Lena stepping into the dark charges the closure with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the observatory and storm constraining choices. The geode functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early with Lena's hunt for potential, escalating through her agency under the hybrid lens. The climax involves a tightening choice that forecloses an option with felt cost, as she becomes the perturbation rather than changing the past.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of potential and choice emerges through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the geode's reprise, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the geode's pulse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature. Voice is consistent and rhythmic under pressure, with purposeful compression. Elision in the climax is taught and paid off, enhancing clarity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied rhythm, advancing story without artifacts. Figurative language like "lightning stitching the ruins" is coherent and purposeful. No loops or scaffold issues; closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes familiar elements into a fresh, non-obvious whole with risk-taking in structure and theme. The geode and perturbation theory transform tropes through specific choices, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
