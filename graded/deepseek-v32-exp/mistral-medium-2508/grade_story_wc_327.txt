<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Veyra's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with internal conflict shown through her hunger to translate everything. Her final choice to continue despite danger is earned by prior causality, and the cost is felt when she becomes part of the echo. Embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure are strong, with no stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural drive lens holds throughout, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (Veyra's transformation into an echo) that carries conceptual cost. Orientation is clear early, and causality is intact with no breaks. The closure lands on the page with felt cost in the final image of the diamond cracking and the starlings' new language.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with the canyon, bone towers, and starlings constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Veyra's POV, enhancing atmosphere. The environment actively pressures tactics, such as the echoes wrapping around her ankles.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Veyra's agency under the accumulative lens, with the stake of translating the language tightening through her use of the diamond. The cost is legible when the echoes turn alive and consume her. One meaningful deepening occurs as the language's revival leads to irreversible consequences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, exploring the dangers of harnessing forbidden knowledge without moralizing. Subtext operates through implication, such as the diamond's curse reweighting meaning at the end. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the starlings' new language and Veyra's echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Veyra, with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control under pressure. Perceptual signature is character-specific, focusing on sensory and textual details. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied syntax, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful and enhances clarity, such as "the grit of consonants" and "silks of vowels." Rhythm supports escalation, and peak beats remain clear without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes elements freshly, with the cursed diamond, echo canyon, and starlings as cipher feeling organic and transformative. Risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without gimmickry. The closure reconfigures prior material with inevitability and conceptual cost.</comment>
