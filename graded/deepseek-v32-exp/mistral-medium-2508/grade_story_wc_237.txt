<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lian's motivation to transform scars into stories is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices like trembling fingers and the deliberate shedding of the quill. Her internal conflict between fear and transformation acts simultaneously in scene, and the final choice to reweave scars is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the silvered lines softening into light. The characterization avoids stock phrasing, and flaws like past experimentation with forbidden symbols compound into a credible endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural drive lens holds consistently, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration where Lian's transformation reweights meaning, cost legible in the scar reweaving and quill shedding. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure coheres through symbolic escalation, taught early with the storm's threat. The final image of the storm learning her language charges the poise without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The floating rock platform and storm environment pressure choices, constraining Lian's actions as she carves runes on the rock and faces the gathering storm. Sensory details like "the valley exhaled" and "scent of ozone" are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV. The quill and scars function as micro-settings that charge the final image of transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming scars escalates under Lian's agency, with one meaningful tightening as she sheds the quill tip and whispers the rune's name, narrowing options. Cost is unmistakable in the scar reweaving and the quill's surrender, driven by accumulative pressure. The storm's return complicates but does not resolve, maintaining coherence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges through particulars like the quill shedding and scars singing, with subtext in gestures and the crow's feather. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing, as Lian realizes the space between storms is where change happens. Earned wisdom arises from concrete struggle, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, lyrical rhythm, and purposeful compression, such as the elision of rune meanings taught early. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, e.g., "her breath hitched," and diction remains within Lian's lexicon. No head-hopping or register drift, and internal thought is consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "the world held itself too tightly" is coherent and voice-motivated, though slightly dense in peaks. No artifacts obscure causality, and closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of rune magic, personal transformation, and lyrical style feels organic and inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific choices like scars as flawed glass. Emotional truth is specific, and risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry. The premise offers a fresh angle on healing, with authenticity of vision.</comment>
