<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Leeward's motivation to "dub" the storm is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions like "fingers twitching" and micro-choices such as leaning into the orchard's sway. His restlessness transforms from fear to thrill, earned by prior causality and visible cost in the closure. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise as the sea's voice and Leeward's laughter crystallize options, cost legible in "the thrill of the next note." Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with pattern taught early and resonance building through strikes. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices, such as the orchard tilting forcing Leeward to adapt his strike, and charges the final image with the sea's response. Sensory details are vivid and selective, e.g., "damp bark," "salt-stiffened cloth," filtered through POV. The floating orchard acts as micro-setting, altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Leeward's agency under accumulative lens, each strike increasing density and reweighting stakes, with cost legible in his transformed restlessness. Dominant stake of turning obstacles into instruments tightens through responses from clouds and sea. No coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of resonance between man and nature emerges through images like clouds as "unplayed sheet music" and the sea's song, without moralizing. Ending offers a non-literal answer with "Obstacle had become instrument," reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in implication and gesture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with distinct perceptual signature in Leeward's interpretation of clouds as music. Voice is poetic and controlled, with rhythmic prose that modulates under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and sentence openings. Minor figurative muddle in "sound bloomed like a bruise" but not contradictory; no loops or scaffolds. Read-aloud test passes with momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of tide prophet and musical resonance feels inevitable, with specific details like the pear tree mallet. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Concept integrates organically with character and conflict.</comment>
