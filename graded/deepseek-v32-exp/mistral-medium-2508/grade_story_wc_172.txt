<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elias's contradictory impulses—amoral philanthropy and secret sentimentality—are concretely embodied in his trembling fingers and the egg's placement, earning the final choice through prior causality of the drought. His micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost, such as foregoing museum preservation for symbolic earth-burial. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; interiority remains character-particular and conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost in the image of the egg sealed in salt, reweighting Elias's legacy under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words (salt flat, Elias tracing cracks), and the persistent constraint of the drought shapes the final act. The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and the cost is legible in "the salt would remember its shape."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The salt flat constrains choice by dictating where the egg can be placed and charges the final image with its brittle crust and fissures that "cradle something fragile." Sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "warm as a secret," "scent of old rain"), filtered through Elias's POV. Environment evolves causally with the approaching storm, altering tactics and deepening atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Elias's internal conflict between destruction and preservation) escalates through his agency in placing the egg, a deepening that forecloses his path of pure scarcity with visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift from "masterpiece" to "counterpoint" reweights options. Cost is legible in the egg's dissolution and Elias's refusal to calculate, charged by the storm's approach.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of legacy and redemption emerges through particulars like the egg and cracks, with subtext in gestures (e.g., listening for "echo of a wingspan"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the salt preserving the egg's shape, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from Elias's struggle, avoiding abstraction or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, biased diction ("slow violence," "fractured grace") that reflects Elias's mind under pressure. Rhythmic control varies with emotional intensity (e.g., short sentences in climax). No head-hopping; purposeful elision (e.g., drought details) is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language ("vein, a map") is coherent and voice-motivated. Sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously, e.g., "The salt flat stretched like a wound." No register drift or artifice; clarity and propulsion are maintained through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of amoral philanthropist, extinct bird's egg, and manufactured drought feels inevitable in hindsight, transformed through specific grounded choices. Risk-taking in the quiet, symbolic closure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, and the core premise integrates organically with character and conflict.</comment>
