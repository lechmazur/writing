<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion. The final acceptance of limits is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the collapse and her stillness. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her desire to hold meaning versus accepting impermanence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (earned stasis) as she accepts limits, with cost legible in "proof, at last, of the limit." Inferred accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, and the tree library constraint shapes tactics. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the tree library pressuring choices through the demolition timeframe and charging the final image. Sensory details like "scent of sap and mildew" are selective and POV-filtered. The environment constrains choice and supports the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of capturing the infinite versus accepting limits escalates under the accumulative lens through time pressure and her agency in crafting the ceiling. Cost is unmistakable in the collapse and her subsequent stillness, foreclosing paths with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of limits and impermanence emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in gestures like painting "nothing." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the portrait of "the space between breaths," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful elision taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "like trying to catch smoke in a net." Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs, and clarity is maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable, with a fresh angle on artistic struggle. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core concept of discovering limits is transformed through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
