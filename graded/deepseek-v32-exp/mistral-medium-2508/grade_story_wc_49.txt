<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply embodied with contradictory impulses (avoiding songs versus embracing truth) that drive the climax; her final choice to sing is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her burning throat and chest tightness, foreclosing her avoidance path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in "the weight of what she’d almost let die"; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density leading to the arbor's revival, and the persistent constraint of forgotten songs shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The verdant arbor constrains choice by its dying state, forcing Mira's action, and charges the final image with revival; sensory details like "brittle tendrils" are selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV without generic placeholder setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Accumulative lens, from realizing the need to sing to the physical strain of singing; cost is unmistakable in her throat burning and the arbor's response, tightening stakes with a meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of tradition versus stories emerges implicitly through Mira's arc; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in "some things are too precious to lose" without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the revived arbor and her new role.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a lyrical perceptual signature ("painting the air in liquid gold"); voice modulates with emotional intensity under pressure, and any elision (e.g., song memories) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with clear propulsion in peaks like "the air shivered in response" and no artifactual muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of tinkerer aesthetics and song magic feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and specific details (e.g., copper-winged automaton) avoid derivative premises.</comment>
