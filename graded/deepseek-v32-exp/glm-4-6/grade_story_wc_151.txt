<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elliot's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority, but lacks contradictory impulses or significant change; the closure is more endurance than transformation, with minimal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost in ephemerality and cyclical return, anchored early and coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the golden arcade and chalk codes constraining choices and charging the final image through POV-filtered detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, escalation is driven by Elliot's agency in drawing codes, with cost legible in chalk fading and cyclical satisfaction; stakes are internal but coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of meaning in liminal spaces emerges through images and rituals, with a resonant, non-literal ending that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature; no head-hopping, and rhythmic control supports pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid with varied rhythm, no loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of futuristic nostalgia and pseudonym creation feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
