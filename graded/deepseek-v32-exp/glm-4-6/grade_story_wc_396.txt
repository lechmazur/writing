<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shael's characterization is deeply integrated with the plot; their calm intuition and empathy are embodied through specific actions, such as handling the crystal fragment and mirrors. The final choice to reconstitute the crystal is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the weighted breath and personal burden. However, internal conflict is underdeveloped, with minimal contradictory impulses shown in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with clear linkage: Shael's use of mirrors leads to the crystal's reformation, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing closure where equality is shown, reweighting the premise with cost (ice floes calming). Orientation is anchored early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity, with cost legible in the final image of intertwined futures.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful; the lighthouse orchard and ice floes pressure choices (e.g., shifts threatening balance), while vintage mirrors and crystal fragment constrain actions and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Shael's POV, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of maintaining balance escalates under the causal lens through Shael's agency with the mirrors, tightening options until the crystal reforms. Cost is visible in the weighted breath and reconstitution, foreclosing paths. However, escalation is somewhat linear without major reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of empathy and balance emerges organically through images and actions, not direct statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with equality shown without moralizing. Subtext operates in the visions and reconstitution, though it leans slightly toward abstraction in the closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, intuitive voice that modulates under pressure. Perceptual signature is strong (e.g., "calmly intuitive" filtering observations), and elision (e.g., weighted breath) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and varied syntax; no significant artifacts, loops, or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, though minor overwriting occurs in descriptions (e.g., "fourteen hundred facets"). Clarity and momentum are maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality is high with a fresh synthesis: shadow-laced peacekeeper, empathy mapping, and crystalline fruits transform familiar tropes through specific world-building and character choices. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
