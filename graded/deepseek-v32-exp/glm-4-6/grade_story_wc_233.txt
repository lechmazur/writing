<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The queen's disenchantment and motivation are clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion (e.g., "eyes shadowed by the weight of a crown"). Her final choice to embrace her celestial nature is earned by prior causality from the dreams and grotto discovery, with visible cost in the kingdom fracturing. However, the transformation feels slightly abrupt in execution, though supported by the narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (queen reclaiming her true self) and felt cost (kingdom fracturing), under a causal drive lens that holds throughout. Orientation is anchored early, and the persistent constraint of recurring dreams shapes tactics. The final image reconfigures stakes with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details (thunder, mist, fireflies) filtered through the queen's POV. The cobalt grotto constrains choice and charges the final image, acting as a micro-setting that pressures the climax. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve with the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (identity vs. duty) is signaled early and escalates through the queen's agency under the causal lens, culminating in a choice that forecloses a path with cost. The climb and grotto discovery tighten options, and the cost is legible in the kingdom's fate. Minor weakness: escalation relies heavily on internal realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of identity and self-discovery emerges organically through events and images (e.g., bleeding starlight, ember grotto), without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the queen's awakening, reweighting prior material with complexity and avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control, using poetic diction that reflects the queen's mindset. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (seneschal's revelation). Minor overwriting in peaks does not obscure clarity, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with purposeful figurative language that advances atmosphere. No significant loops or artifacts; sentences propel the story forward. Minor register drift in "lacy menace" is voice-motivated and effective.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of celestial guardian tropes with a queen's disenchantment, transformed through specific details and character-driven choices. Risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without gimmickry, though the premise echoes familiar motifs.</comment>
