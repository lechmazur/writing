<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The poet's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing the postcard with trembling fingers. The "shyly unstoppable" trait is shown through persistent writing, and the final reach for the blossom is earned by centuries of longing. However, minor lack of contradictory impulses in scene prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as the blossom dissolves pain, cost legible in "the pain he’d hoarded for ages began to dissolve." Accumulative/textural lens holds strong with imagery buildup. Orientation is clear early, and causality is seamless, with the postcard's glow leading to the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the shell constraining choice as a sanctuary and the blossom charging the final image. Sensory details like "pearlescent walls" and "reef-shadow joy" are filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by poet's agency under accumulative lens, as he follows the melody to the blossom, with cost legible in the pain's transformation. Stakes around transforming pain are dominant and tighten meaningfully, though the positive cost slightly reduces tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transforming pain into beauty emerges organically through images and events, with subtext in the postcard and blossom. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though slight explicitness in "pain wasn’t something to be erased" holds it back from higher.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic perceptual signature, e.g., "off-key wind" and "reef-shadow joy." Rhythm and diction are controlled under pressure, and purposeful elision in lyrical mode pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language like "nebulae trapped in paper" serving purpose. No loops or scaffolds, but minor overwriting in peaks, e.g., "photosynthesize pain into beauty," slightly reduces clarity without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in fresh synthesis of immortal poet, galaxy postcard, and blossom armistice, with specifics like the shell setting. Emotional truth avoids clichés, and risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
