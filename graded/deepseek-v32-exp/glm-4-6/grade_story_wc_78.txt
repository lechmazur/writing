<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prophet's motivation to transform obstacles into music is clear and consistent, driving all actions; interiority is embodied through selective perception and micro-choices under pressure, though internal conflict is minimal, leaning on steadfast endurance rather than contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in the prophet's solitary composition as survival; orientation is immediate, and causality flows through pattern-building without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices—e.g., hollow fruit and driftwood become instruments; sensory details are purposeful and filtered through the prophet's bias, charging the final image of the spinning orchard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes of survival through music escalate via accumulative density under protagonist agency; cost is felt in the transformation of loneliness and storms into harmony, with a cadence shift at the swell and silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transforming adversity into art emerges organically from images and actions, not statement; subtext in music as prayer/rebellion offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic, rhythmic prose; perceptual signature is clear in the prophet's interpretation of clouds and sounds; no head-hopping, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent and supports pressure; sentences advance story and atmosphere seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing solitude, music, and survival with inevitability; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels earned.</comment>
