<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, with interiority shown through embodied actions like tracing coffee rings. Her change from erasing to reading scars is earned by the plant telepathy and realization, with visible cost in her apology to Samuel. Contradictory impulses act in scene, and the final choice is causally driven.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change in Maya's practice, supported by accumulative/textural lens through patterns of imagery. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in her apology and new commitment. The frosted hourglass and coffee rings charge the final image with persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the tower, coffee rings, and hourglass filtering through Maya's POV. Sensory details are selective and urgent, and objects like the coffee rings constrain choice by revealing patterns that drive her realization, charging the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake in Maya's internal conflict escalates through plant telepathy, leading to a tightening choice to apologize and change practice. Agency is clear, with cost felt in her admission and new approach. Escalation is driven by protagonist under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of reading scars rather than erasing them emerges organically from images and events, without moralizing. Subtext in plant whispers and coffee rings deepens meaning, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal reweighting through Maya's new practice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and close to Maya, with distinct perceptual signature in lyrical prose like "meteor hush." Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present. No head-hopping, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, advancing story without muddle. Sentences propel momentum, especially in peak beats like the realization scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and non-obvious, blending scar healing with plant telepathy in a synthesis that feels inevitable. Emotional truth anchors risk-taking, and specific details like the displaced miracle concept heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
