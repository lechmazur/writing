<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The interpreter's contradictory impulses of confidence and uncertainty are embodied in scene, and the final choice to embrace imperfection is earned through prior causality with visible cost. Micro-choices like unbending the nib and rewriting demonstrate a hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as an Earned Stasis with felt cost (loss of certainty for meaning), and the Causal lens holds tightly through because/therefore linkages. The gravitational anomaly acts as a persistent constraint that shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly and exotic pen function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the interpreter's professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens, with a clear tightening from writing to erasing to rewriting. The cost of losing the garden of doubt is legible on the page and reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the garden of doubt and the pen's work, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to finding meaning in imperfection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. The voice is poetic yet precise, and any elision (e.g., the pen's history) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, even in peak beats like the rewriting sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The concept of editing history through celestial signals is a fresh synthesis, transformed through specific details like the dead star residue. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
