<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the investigation with concrete micro-choices like heating the stamp. Interiority is embodied through trembling fingers and fervent determination, though lacks contradictory impulses under pressure. Final documentation of findings is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in his renewed purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal drive holds strong with because/therefore linkages from investigation to revelation. Closure is a decisive change—the city's intentional construction—landing with cost in the corrected historical narratives. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the blackout constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with the watery dome and candlelight, constraining choices via the blackout and hydroelectric failure. The stamp and maps recur to charge the final image, integrating sensory detail through POV bias. Spatial choreography remains coherent, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—tracing honest origins—escalates through Elias's agency, tightening as hypotheses form and evidence mounts. Cost is legible in his feverish determination and the conceptual price of rewritten history. Under causal lens, one meaningful deepening reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge preservation emerges organically from events, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of light finding its way, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in stillness and the library's whispered truths.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—logical yet perceptive—filtered through Elias's profession. Voice modulates with pressure, e.g., "dappled resolve," and prose rhythm supports emotional beats. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language like "light eventually finds its way" is purposeful. Sentence-level rhythm accelerates with discovery, maintaining clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh twist on post-apocalyptic preservation, transformed through specific details like the octopus stamp and waterproofing techniques. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in the quiet, conceptual closure. Avoids derivative templates.</comment>
