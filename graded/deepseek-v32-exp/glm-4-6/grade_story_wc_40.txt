<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The scholar's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices revealing his hierarchy of values. His final renunciation as witness is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the closure. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing) as the scholar understands decay, with felt cost in the silence. The accumulative/textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early. The crystal's constraint shapes tactics, and the ending reweights meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The library setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail, constraining choices through the crystal and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the atmosphere supports the theme without generic clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the scholar's agency under the accumulative lens, with the crystal's responses deepening stakes. The cost is legible in the realization of decay, foreclosing options with a visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to language's end without moralizing. Subtext operates through the crystal's memories, and the ending reweights prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that reflects the scholar's mindset. Prose rhythm and diction are controlled under pressure, and any elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The premise offers a fresh synthesis of silence and decay, transformed through specific details and character choice. Risk-taking in the quiet ending heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
