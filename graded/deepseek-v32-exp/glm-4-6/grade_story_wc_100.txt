<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's characterization is strong with clear motivation rooted in his profession and personal history; his inadvertent stubbornness drives the plot and is embodied in his obsessive repair attempts. Interiority is concrete, such as his muttering "Impossible" at 3:17 AM, showing contradiction between weariness and determination. The final realization about his own lack of permanent rest is earned through his journey, with cost felt in the chasing stillness. Minor weakness: stubbornness is occasionally stated rather than fully shown, but it doesn't undermine closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight causal chain under the Causal lens, from package arrival to diving expeditions to lens repair, with clear because/therefore linkages. Closure is a Decisive Change with cost: the lens guides souls, but Marcus's own rest remains elusive, legible in "stillness that kept chasing him." Orientation is anchored early—undertaker, post-ceremony, basement—and the drive lens holds without ambiguity. No plot amnesia or teleporting props; all set-ups pay off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Settings are vivid and purposeful, from the aged leather box to the underwater library, with sensory details like "fish darted between bookshelves" creating atmosphere. The environment constrains choices: the library's impossible spaces are essential for the lens repair, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Marcus's professional focus, and spatial choreography is coherent. No generic placeholder or white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled—giving rest to lost souls—and escalate through Marcus's agency under the Causal lens, from initial curiosity to life-threatening dives. One meaningful tightening occurs when he occupies impossible spaces, forcing a trade-off with personal cost. Cost is legible in his divided existence and the enduring chase for stillness. No coincidence resolves conflict; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of rest and guidance emerges organically through events and images, like the lens transforming into a portal, without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures, such as Mrs. Hargrove's peaceful appearance. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: Marcus helps others find permanence but not himself, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost. No thematic echo or sermonizing; ambiguity lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct weary, professional voice reflected in syntax and perception. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven, like Mrs. Hargrove's whisper advancing closure. Purposeful compression in the underwater scene maintains clarity, and psychic distance shifts intentionally. No head-hopping or register drift; voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic, with high information density—e.g., "fractured like frozen lightning" does multiple jobs. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story momentum. Minor overwriting in dense metaphors (e.g., "like curious librarians") but not pervasive enough to harm clarity. Read-aloud ear test passes with varied openings and paragraph lengths.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and non-obvious, synthesizing undertaker lore with supernatural distress signals in an organic way. Tropes are transformed through specific choices, like the underwater library as a knowledge source. Risk-taking in the impossible spaces method heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth and specificity avoid derivative templates; closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
