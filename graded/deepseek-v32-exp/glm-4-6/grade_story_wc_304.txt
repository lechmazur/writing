<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, e.g., "her own breath catch." Micro-choices under pressure reveal values, but lacks contradictory impulses, limiting peak score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the voyager's deeper repose and the mortician's enduring purpose. Accumulative lens holds; orientation is clear early with who, where, when anchored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the skyborne grotto and aurora creating atmosphere. The emerald chip as micro-setting charges the final image, but environment doesn't strongly constrain choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing memory) escalates through protagonist's agency in sifting static and infusing the chip. Cost is legible in the emotional catch and effort under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preserving memory against oblivion emerges through events and images, not statement. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer with the captured spark reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Poetic voice remains consistent under pressure; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, though slightly lush in peaks, but clarity is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing memory capture with mortal transition. Emotional truth and risk-taking in quiet closure feel inevitable and coherent.</comment>
