<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Courier's jittery nature is consistently embodied and transforms into purposeful vibration, earning the final change through pendant use and hermit encounter. Interiority is concrete with micro-choices under pressure, though the transformation feels slightly neat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with closure as resonant reconfiguration; cost is legible in courier's altered movement and understanding. Orientation is clear early, and pendant's constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Aurora-lit ridgeway and pendant function as micro-setting that pressure choices (storm forces shelter) and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens through density of encounters (snow hare, hermit) and pendant's response, driven by courier's agency. Cost is felt in foreclosed jittery path, though stakes remain internal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wonder-weaving emerges organically from particulars like pendant vibrations and hermit's speech, with ending offering non-literal resonance. No moralizing; subtext in imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct lyrical voice and rhythmic control; dialogue with hermit is natural and goal-driven. Minor purple prose but consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats like the hermit encounter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes relic courier with unique magic system, transforming tropes through specific lived detail. Risk-taking in accumulative structure pays off with inevitability.</comment>
