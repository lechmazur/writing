<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The gardener's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices. His protected vulnerability and pragmatic approach drive higher-stakes actions, and the final community adoption earns his endurance with visible cost. However, slight perfection in his character limits deeper flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (community adopting mirrors), under an accumulative/textural lens that holds. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening. The cost is legible in the gardener's nightly labor and maintained system.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and purposeful (e.g., rusty fire escape, luminous harbor), with the environment constraining choices like mirror placement. The bitting gauge tooth as a micro-setting charges the final image. Specificity is high, but minor reliance on visual senses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (addressing spiritual darkness) is signaled early, escalating through the gardener's agency under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in his efforts and the community's response, with one meaningful deepening. However, escalation is gradual without high tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images (light in darkness, community persistence), with subtext in gestures and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, and earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and lyrical prose. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and rhythmic control under pressure is strong. No head-hopping or register drift, but dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has varied rhythm and high information density without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, but minor overwriting exists (e.g., "quivering hush"). Clarity and momentum are maintained, with no artifacts harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, transforming tropes through grounded choices. Synthesis feels inevitable, with emotional truth and risk in quiet persistence. However, it lacks bold structural risks, limiting higher innovation.</comment>
