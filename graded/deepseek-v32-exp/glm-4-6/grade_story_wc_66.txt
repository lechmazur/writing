<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal his obsession. His final shift from copying to creating new lyrics is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction is minimal for this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the dust whispering tales, breaking the famine under an accumulative/textural lens. Cost is legible in Elias's effort and the transformation, with the persistent constraint of the famine shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the ember alcove and crystal constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, reflecting Elias's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the accumulative lens, from transcribing lyrics to using the crystal, with cost unmistakable in the renewed magic and faded broadcast. Stakes are clear and tighten meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of renewal emerges through events and images like dust and embers, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in lyrics and symbols enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature consistent under pressure. Dialogue (lyrics) is natural and goal-driven, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, advancing story without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic and artistic renewal, with specifics like the copyist and pirate broadcast feeling inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
