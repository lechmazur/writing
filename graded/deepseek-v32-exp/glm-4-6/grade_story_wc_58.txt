<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority; his motive to write obituaries for the living drives credible micro-choices, and his final reflective state earns its cost through prior causality. The gardener, though off-page, is vividly rendered through Elias's projection, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as Elias integrates loneliness and presence, with cost legible in "profoundly lonely and breathtakingly present." The accumulative/textural lens holds, and orientation is anchored early without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The shadowed garden constrains choice and charges the final image, with sensory details like "barren roses" and "skeletal apple trees" filtered through POV. The setting's role in mirroring absences is indispensable to the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency in writing the obituary, deepening the stake of understanding healing under the accumulative lens. The cost is felt in his loneliness, foreclosing other paths with visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of healing through integration of absences emerges organically from particulars like the garden signs and carpet thread, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm and diction reflect Elias's reflective state, and any elision (e.g., the gardener's backstory) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, though minor overwriting in metaphors like "geography of healing" slightly muddles peak beats. No major artifacts or loops harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise of writing obituaries for the living is freshly synthesized with the garden of explained absences, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
