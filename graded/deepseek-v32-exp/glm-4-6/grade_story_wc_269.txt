<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied interiority (e.g., tapping rhythms, genuine smile). His change from passive witness to active participant is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens, with cost legible in Elias's realization and decision to walk. The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sea level monitoring station constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid, purposeful sensory details (e.g., creaking, salt smell). Specificity is high and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency in assembling pieces and tapping rhythms, under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in his transformed role. Stakes are clear and deepen meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of transformation and cycles emerges naturally from events and images, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext in the atlas page and rhythms enriches without moralizing.</comment>
