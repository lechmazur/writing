<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris's skepticism is consistently embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., tracing the window, following footprints), and his transformation is earned, though the shift from doubt to belief feels slightly rapid, slightly diminishing the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with felt cost ("his doubt crack" and "felt more alone than ever") under an accumulative/textural lens; the tower's role as catalyst is persistent, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rainwashed tower constrains choice (footprints guide ascent) and charges the final image; sensory details (e.g., "bronze quiet") are selective and purposeful, fully integrated with POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Aris's agency under the accumulative lens (placing the amber), with cost legible in his altered state; stakes tighten meaningfully, though the internal conflict resolution is swift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of homecoming as alignment emerges through particulars (amber, footprints) without moralizing; the ending reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "bronze quiet"); voice remains coherent under pressure, and elision (e.g., pilgrimage details) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, even in peak beats (e.g., "doubt crack like the tower stones").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of skeptic, artificial pilgrimage, and fly amber feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in lyric accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
