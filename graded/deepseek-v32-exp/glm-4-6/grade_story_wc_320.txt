<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as discarding assumptions to tune the signal. The final realization is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the signal fading. However, internal contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced, limiting peak impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, as Elias's understanding that the signal comes from the fragment reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the fragment as a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and purposeful, with the abandoned radio tower city and gorge pressuring choices through isolation and atmospheric energy. The Hollywood star fragment functions as a micro-setting that constrains action and charges the final image, integrating sensory detail with POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency in tuning and discarding assumptions, under the accumulative lens, with a meaningful tightening when he realizes the signal's origin. Cost is legible in the signal's fade and his gained insight, though the stakes remain introspective without external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as silence as information and beginnings in endings, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Elias's realization, reweighting prior material with purposeful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature that reflects Elias's profession and mindset. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision (e.g., signal description) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no significant loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though minor overwriting in descriptive passages slightly reduces propulsion without harming closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story synthesizes elements like celestial signals and Hollywood fragments into a fresh, inevitable whole, with risk-taking in lyrical style that heightens stakes. Specificity in details and transformation of tropes avoid derivative premises, supporting coherence and originality.</comment>
