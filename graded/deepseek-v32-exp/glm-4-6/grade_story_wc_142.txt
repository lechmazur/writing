<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with interiority showing her dual allegiance evolving into a woven resilience. Her actions under pressure reveal values, and the final endurance is earned with visible cost. Minor summarization in middle beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strong with Mara's agency driving plot; closure is a resonant reconfiguration as the community adapts without losing its soul, cost legible in the continued struggle. Orientation is clear early, and structure coheres with meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image; the raft carnival's sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven through action. The environment pressures tactics, such as the graffiti network using the carnival's aesthetics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear with preservation vs. privatization; escalation is driven by Mara's agency through the graffiti network, narrowing options. Cost is legible in the community's unified response and the developers' curiosity, though some escalation feels gradual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events—adaptation and community resilience—with subtext in graffiti and the finale. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the final image of Mara continuing her work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is strong in Mara's pattern-noticing. No head-hopping, and elision (e.g., graffiti mechanics) is taught and paid off. Dialogue absent, so focus on narration's consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, advancing story without major artifacts. Rhythm varies purposefully, though minor overwriting in descriptive passages prevents a higher score. No loops or scaffold issues harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of floating carnival and privatization resistance, with Mara's graffiti method as a non-obvious innovation. Risk-taking in structure and detail heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
