<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "charcoal-stained fingers trembling"). Final choice to reclaim art is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the cathartic release. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early; causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages (opening painting leads to sketching). Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost ("weight of his decision settling in"). Persistent constraint of the cave shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful ("subterranean crystal cave" pulses with auroral sorrow). Sensory details reflect POV bias and pressure choices; environment constrains and charges the final image of resurrection. No generic placeholder elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict over creativity) escalates under causal lens via protagonist agency (finding box, sketching). Cost is legible in "cathartic release" and weight lifted. One meaningful tightening forecloses exile path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of inescapable callings emerges through events and images (charcoal, cave), not statement; ending offers resonant, non-literal reweighting ("wings not chains"). Subtext in gesture and silence avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control ("auroral sorrow" modulates with pressure). No head-hopping; voice is consistent and purposefully compressed under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated. Sentence variety supports rhythm without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Organic synthesis feels inevitable; specific details (crystal cave, charcoal stick) transform tropes. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure recharges prior material.</comment>
