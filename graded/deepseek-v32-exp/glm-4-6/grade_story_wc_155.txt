<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to rediscover lost joy is clear and consistent, driving her actions; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "smile of pensive mirth"), and the final satisfaction is earned through her agency, with cost felt in energy waning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the light fading and quiet satisfaction; orientation is clear early, and causality from fragment to resurrection is tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with sensory details (e.g., fog, moss-covered wall) that constrain choice and charge the final image; the orchard district actively shapes the resurrection and its dissolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (rediscovering joy) escalate under Accumulative lens through Elara's agency in using her gift, with cost unmistakable in energy drain and transient resurrection; one meaningful tightening deepens emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and joy emerges organically through images and action, not statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the fragment's warmth and Elara's satisfaction, reweighting loss without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (artist's lens); voice is lyrical and controlled, with rhythmic prose that heightens pressure; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and no loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful (e.g., "light began to bleed"), and clarity remains high in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and ingeniously synthesized (painting with light resurrecting memories); specific details (fresco fragment, orchard) make it inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
