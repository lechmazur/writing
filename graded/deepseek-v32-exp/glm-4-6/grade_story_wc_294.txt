<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Jasper's motives are clear and consistent, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure; his polished calm and final renunciation are earned by prior causality, though his emotional range is slightly narrow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the final image of worthless currency; accumulative/textural lens holds with clear orientation and causal linkages from inheritance to wisdom.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Settings like the circus train and money collection are vivid and selective, constraining choices and charging the closure; sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens deepens patterns of cycles; Jasper's agency in investing and leaving the startup drives stakes, with cost visible in failure and return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of cycles emerges through images and events without moralizing; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through particulars like currency and paths.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice maintains rhythmic control under pressure, and dialogue (when present) is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with high information density and varied syntax; no loops or artifacts, and figurative language coheres without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of inheritance, cycles, and tech; tropes transformed through specific choices, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
