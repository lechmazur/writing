<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's interiority is concrete and embodied, with credible emotional progression from crestfallen to remade. Micro-choices under pressure, like aligning the box pieces, reveal hierarchy of values. Final endurance is earned by prior causality, though some abstract phrasing slightly dilutes peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost in the artist's transformation. Orientation is clear early, and the decision to descend into darkness tightens options meaningfully. The mended tarot box serves as a decisive image charging the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image—the library's shelves lean inward, mirroring internal state. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, with the lighthouse beam illuminating the path. Environment actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens, with cost legible in the untangling process. Dominant stake (internal rebuilding) tightens through the decision to embrace darkness. One meaningful deepening forecloses prior despair, though pressure could be more visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images like fractured tarot cards and the mended box, offering a non-literal answer to central questions. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, resisting moralizing. Final reconfiguration reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic rhythm and perceptual signature reflecting the artist's state. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure. Diction remains within character lexicon, enhancing emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in figurative language slightly muddles peak beats. No significant loops or scaffold; sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative design. Closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric style heightening stakes. Specificity in details like the tarot box and library avoids cliché. Transformation is earned through character choice, not gimmickry.</comment>
