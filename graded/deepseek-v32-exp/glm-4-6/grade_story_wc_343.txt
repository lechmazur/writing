<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to earn respect is clear and intensifies, driving his curiosity and discoveries. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotions, such as his breath catching, and his transformation to keeper is earned by prior causality. Micro-choices under pressure, like tracing patterns and noting discrepancies, reveal his values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with cost as Elias becomes the keeper of stranded luminance, foreclosing his apprentice path. Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages from discovery to realization. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible in his new role and plans to present the discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the antique airship and starling murmurations charging the final image and constraining choices. Sensory details like faded chalk patterns and darkening sky are integrated into action, reflecting Elias's POV and enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under causal lens, from examining the hopscotch board to realizing its connection to starlings.

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the hopscotch board and stranded luminance, without moralizing.

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature reflective of Elias's curiosity and observational bias. Voice is consistent and purposeful, with no head-hopping, and prose rhythm supports emotional intensity without register shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or scaffold.
