<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tutor's interior contradiction (lying vs. truth-telling) acts in scene, and her admission is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the weight of her secret. Elias applies pressure, and their status shift is legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive holds with because/therefore linkages from lies to revelation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as truths melt away, with cost legible in the building's sigh and shared familiarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The antique desk seal functions as micro-setting, constraining choice by unlocking the building's language and charging the final image. Sensory details (jasmine, meteors) are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from interrogation to admission, narrowing options with cost legible in the raw truth replacing lies. Dominant stake (secret vs. curiosity) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth and memory emerges from particulars like the seal and lies, with a resonant, non-literal answer in "some lies are just doorways." Subtext operates in gestures and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical yet controlled under pressure. Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety without artifacts. Figurative language ("smooth as aged parchment") is coherent and supports momentum, with no loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes language, architecture, and lies into a non-obvious, organic whole. Risk-taking in the magical realism heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
