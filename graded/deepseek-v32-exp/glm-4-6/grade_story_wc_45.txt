<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eleanor's characterization is concrete and consistent, with internal conflict between wariness and warmth embodied in her interactions. Her final choice to return the tooth is earned by prior causality, showcasing a hierarchy of values under pressure. The child's ancient wisdom in a youthful form adds depth without stereotyping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly from investigation to closure, with orientation anchored early. Closure is a conceptual repricing where the cleft in certainty expands into understanding, cost legible in the garden dimming and Eleanor's transformed perspective. No causality breaks; the ending reweights prior material with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image: the hedge maze demands intuition, and the garden's impossible botany mirrors thematic balance. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as the gate's shifting patterns and starlight-dripping willow, integrating environment with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of interworld balance escalates through Eleanor's agency—her investigation and garden visit lead to a decisive choice with cost (tooth's dissolution, garden dimming). Pressure coheres under causal lens, foreclosing options and deepening knowledge in a single meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of certainty versus flexibility emerges organically through events and imagery, like the tooth's warmth and the child's constellation stones. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting mistakes as part of a pattern through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature blending scientific rigor and wonder. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in the child's cryptic lines. Voice remains coherent under pressure, with purposeful elision and rhythmic control, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "Manacles of starlight." Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs, and closure is clear with no muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of forensic realism and Fae mythology feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like the changeling's tooth. Risk-taking in genre blending heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
