<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies through embodied emotion and micro-choices, such as smudging the illustration. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with contradictions like "auroral sorrow" and "swaying certainties" acting simultaneously. The final renunciation—accepting the burden of her brother's silence—is earned by prior causality with visible cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies detract from the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost: the realization that truth is an absence reweights the premise. The hybrid drive lens (causal and accumulative) holds, with Elara's actions driving revelations. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the final image of the smudged illustration anchors the cost. No causality breaks or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details like "storm-lashed windows" and "thin air" pressuring Elara's isolation. The botanical illustration and sextant recur as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details are filtered through POV bias. The station's environment fundamentally shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding the truth's weight) escalates under the hybrid lens through Elara's agency, notably the smudging action that narrows options. Cost is legible in the "gravitational pull of its absence" and the burden of silence. Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully without coincidence. The final reconfiguration forecloses paths with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images like the Edelweiss and smudges, exploring truth as absence without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures (trembling fingers) and implication, resisting tidy resolutions. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the conceptual repricing of grief. No abstract philosophizing or thematic echo in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in rhythmic, poetic prose. Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., "fever had broken... thoughts muddied," and elision (e.g., "fault-tolerant oracle") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift; internal texture remains consistent. Dialogue is absent, so those bullets are waived.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats; however, minor overwriting occurs in phrases like "auroral sorrow" and "swaying certainties," slightly dampening propulsion. Closure image remains clear and charged. Grammar and punctuation are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of fault-tolerant oracle and botanical illustration feels inevitable and fresh, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the core premise offers a non-obvious angle on grief and truth. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, and the closure commits fully to its implications.</comment>
