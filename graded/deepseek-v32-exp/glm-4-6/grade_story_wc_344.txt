<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; embodied emotions (tears freezing) and micro-choices (working with gears) reveal character under stress. Final choice to repair timepiece and herself is earned by prior causality with visible cost, though some interiority edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly; closure is a decisive change with felt cost (tears, melting library) that reconfigures her identity and environment. Orientation is immediate, and the rhythm of repair logic is consistent, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful; the frozen library and hall of mirrors constrain choices (e.g., mirrors distorting gear reflections) and charge the final image (mirrors reforming with warm glow). Sensory details are filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under causal lens, from handling gears to climax where mirrors shatter; cost is legible in tears and library transformation. Stakes of self-repair are deepened through tangible actions, though one minor tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of repair and self-healing emerges organically through images (gears, mirrors) without direct statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the repaired timepiece and melted books, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (poetic, nostalgic); voice remains coherent under pressure, and elision (e.g., prophecy fragments) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic control and high information density without loops or artifacts; figurative language ("driftwood nostalgia") is purposeful and clear. Minor overwriting in peaks is offset by propulsion toward closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (lunar-eclipse locksmith, frozen library) feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure integrates concept fully.</comment>
