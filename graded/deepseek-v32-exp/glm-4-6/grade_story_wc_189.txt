<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing the cicada to navigate the difficult conversation. The tangential approach reveals contradictory impulses acting in scene, and the final choice to guide the conversation is earned by prior causality with visible cost in Mara's softening expression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the conversation finding its cadence as the tide unifies the pools, landing with felt cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the tidal constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The grotto and tidal pool function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image, with sensory details filtered through Elian's POV. The jade cicada and incoming tide actively pressure decisions, avoiding postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elian's agency under the Accumulative lens, using observational metaphors to deepen the stakes of the unsaid words, with cost legible in the emotional shift and natural flow of the conversation. One meaningful tightening occurs through cadence shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transition emerges through particulars like the tidal pool and cicada, with subtext in gesture and silence, offering a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. No moralizing; epiphanies are earned through concrete experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, poetic yet controlled rhythm, and purposeful elision. Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of transition themes feels inevitable, with specific details (tidal pools, jade cicada) transforming familiar material. Risk-taking in structure and tone heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
