<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving key choices like tracing the button's history. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "heart marked by sorrow felt faint warmth"), and his final resonant reconfiguration is earned by prior causality. However, internal conflict lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, limiting peak intensity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise with felt cost ("heart marked by sorrow felt faint warmth"), reconfiguring Elias's view under the Accumulative lens. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and causality holds through dust patterns triggering investigation. The persistent constraint of the files shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the foster care file room constraining choices (dust patterns guide discovery) and charging the final image (button and drawing pairing). Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, integrating action and emotion without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Elias's internal conflict between sorrow and hope) escalates under the Accumulative lens through agency-driven discoveries (button, notes, drawing), tightening meaning and legible cost. However, escalation lacks a decisive turn that forecloses a live option, keeping it below 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of small kindnesses emerges organically from particulars (button, drawing, notes) without moralizing, offering a resonant non-literal answer at closure. Subtext operates through images and implications, and the final reconfiguration reweights prior material with emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (lyrical, reflective voice) and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping or elision issues, but minor register consistency in peak beats prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, with varied syntax and rhythm supporting emotional beats. No artifacts obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality lies in a fresh synthesis of bureaucratic setting with intimate human connection, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in quiet, internal narrative heightens stakes, but premise echoes familiar templates slightly, limiting ingenuity.</comment>
