<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions like bleeding fingers and collapse showing cost. Her wistful nature is shown through concrete actions, and the final endurance is earned by prior causality, foreclosing paths with visible sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as she feels her brother's presence, with cost legible in her physical strain. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through imagery, and the raveling silence persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the orchard and loom constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like the bamboo rustling and amber bead's pulse are selective and filtered through Elara's POV, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early and escalate under the accumulative lens through her weaving, driven by agency. Cost is unmistakable in her bleeding fingers and collapse, narrowing options and foreclosing paths with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from events and images, such as the silence and weaving, with subtext in the bead's sparkle. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the threaded hope, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic rhythm and perceptual signature reflecting Elara's emotional state. Purposeful compression, like "hush of time's unraveling tapestry," enhances pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though minor density in peak beats slightly affects clarity, but closure remains untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of weaving silence and jigsaw puzzles, feeling inevitable. Risk-taking with lyrical prose heightens stakes, and the core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
