<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elea's motivation to understand thresholds is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion in moments like "featherly determined fingers." Her realization about necessary distances is earned through on-page analysis, but some emotional descriptors lean abstract, slightly reducing concrete interiority under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost ("some distances, once crossed, could never be un-crossed"), under an Accumulative/Textural lens built through pattern and imagery. Orientation is anchored early, and the drive lens holds, though causality is slightly loose in the middle beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (e.g., "fractured light across morning mists") and the micro-setting of wood grain charge the final image by constraining Elea's choices. The drifting prism terrace atmospherically supports the theme, but its direct pressure on tactics is subtle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elea's agency in analyzing wood and logbook codes, deepening her understanding under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the conceptual price of preserving necessary distances, though the escalation is more thematic than action-driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of necessary distances emerges organically through images like wood grain and thresholds, with the ending offering a non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Subtext is rich, but occasional near-statement (e.g., "necessary distances") slightly reduces ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice ("featherly determined"), and perceptual signature is consistent. No dialogue, but prose rhythm supports pressure, though some phrases like "fractured hush" risk over-stylization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with varied syntax, advancing story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "featherly determined heart") doesn't obscure clarity, and no loops or scaffold issues harm momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes butterfly effect, thresholds, and maze imagery into a fresh, inevitable whole. Lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, though the abstract style may not suit all markets.</comment>
