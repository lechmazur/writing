<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Leo's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictions like "confidently uncertain" driving micro-choices. His motivation intensifies under pressure from the grille cloth discovery, compelling a higher-stake choice to abandon the inventory. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in leaving work unfinished.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strong, with because/therefore linkages from the cloth find to the flashback and decisive change. Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), with cost legible in the unfinished inventory and shifted purpose. Orientation is clear early, and no plot breaks harm causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting vividly pressures choices: the quarry trailer's sterility and dynamite vibrations contrast with Leo's past, constraining his emotional insulation. The speaker grille cloth as a micro-setting object charges the final image, with sensory details like "dust and stale coffee" filtered through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose after loss) escalates through protagonist agency under the causal lens, tightening with the cloth discovery and memory. Cost is unmistakable in Leo's choice to leave, foreclosing his appraiser role with a visible trade-off. No coincidence resolves; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—the grille cloth symbolizes meaning in "aftermath," reweighted without moralizing. Subtext operates in images like "broken drums" and the final wind whistle, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to loss. Epiphanies are earned through specific struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "echo valley longing" and amp hum metaphors. Voice modulates under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., memory triggers) pays off at closure. No head-hopping; diction remains character-bound and rhythmic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language like "giant, broken drums" is coherent and voice-motivated. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the climax, and closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of redemption arc through specific details (Vox amp, New Orleans memory) feels inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet ending heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming the "after the applause" concept with grounded character choices.</comment>
