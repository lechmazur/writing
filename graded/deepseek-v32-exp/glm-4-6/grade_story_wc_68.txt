<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sebastian's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in rational rebellion, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as agonizing over his mission and meticulously documenting findings. His final endurance is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the rising flood. However, some interiority edges toward diagnostic language (e.g., "rationally rebellious nature"), slightly reducing immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise as Sebastian emerges with evidence, vowing truth survives, reconfiguring stakes under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and events link logically from cog discovery to charts. Cost is legible in the flooding and state opposition, though the time jump ("Three years after...") slightly weakens causal tightness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—limestone walls, sedimentary layers, flooding tunnels—and constrains choices, charging the final image. Sensory details (acrid air, condensation) reflect POV bias and urgency. The cog as micro-setting actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (truth vs. authority) escalate through Sebastian's agency under causal lens, from cog discovery to chart uncovering, with cost in physical danger and state enmity. The flooding tightens options, but the escalation relies slightly on summary in middle beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of truth preservation emerges organically from particulars like the cog and charts, with subtext in actions and images. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though the phrase "epistemological diversity" edges toward abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct—philosophical, reflective—with perceptual signature in selective details. Rhythm controls pressure, and elision (time jumps) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and sensory specificity. Minor artifacts include a paraphrase loop ("competing narratives gnawed at him" echoing earlier themes) and occasional register drift ("epistemological diversity"), but clarity at closure is unharmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes post-apocalyptic archaeology with philosophical rebellion in a fresh, inevitable way. Tropes are transformed through specific detail (e.g., chronometer cog), and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
