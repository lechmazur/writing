<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's foresight and motivation are clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. His final acceptance of his nature is earned by prior causality, though the abstract motivation slightly limits depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Kael accepts his role after healing the AI, under a causal lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of his foresight shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and specific, with the bunker and wafer seal constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful, though some descriptions could be more integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the causal lens, with the AI's decay forcing a transcendent choice. Cost is legible in his acceptance, though stakes remain somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of paths forging walkers emerges through events and images, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext is strong, avoiding moralizing, but the realization is slightly explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control. No head-hopping; elision in the dream sequence is taught and paid off, though prose can be dense at peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is information-dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and no major loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent, but occasional complexity slightly obscures clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of foresight and AI decay, transformed through specific character choices. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though it echoes familiar tropes.</comment>
