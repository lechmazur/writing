<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Emmie's motivation is clear and consistent, driving higher-stakes choices; her steadfastness is embodied under pressure, and the final decision to preserve the truce is earned with visible cost. However, internal contradiction is minimal, with no strong opposing impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—Emmie captures evidence and reconfigures justice—under a causal lens; the sunrise timeframe acts as a persistent constraint, and cost is legible in the revelation of her father's murder. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality holds through sequenced attempts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and POV-filtered, with the pirate market and watch fob constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details (e.g., "dim lantern light") are selective and purposeful, integrating into action and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Emmie's agency under the causal lens, with each failed attempt narrowing options and raising cost; the diversion tactic and recording capture demonstrate earned reversal, though the final diversion feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from trust and betrayal, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through Emmie's strategic choice; subtext operates in the recording device capturing "trust breaking," avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with perceptual signature reflecting Emmie's urgency; dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision (e.g., failed attempts) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic, with high information density and varied sentence structures; no significant loops or artifacts, though minor phrases like "comforting unease" edge toward telling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the unique synthesis of pirate market, watch fob recorder, and false-start method; tropes are transformed through specific setting and character, with emotional truth and risk-taking heightening stakes.</comment>
