<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The immortal's motivation is clear and rooted in ennui, with embodied emotion like "patience worn to a translucence." His final choice to unmake himself is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in dissolution. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as craving an end despite immortality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change and cost as "he felt himself dissolve," under a causal lens. The magnetic fields and amulet fragment create persistent constraints that shape tactics. Orientation is clear early, and the spatial mutiny's payoff is legible and inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite constrains choices, such as navigating "shifting light-prisms," and charges the final image as it warps around the vortex. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, like "facets humming like a trapped thought," integrating setting into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, tracing the amulet's path and leveraging magnetic fields. The cost is unmistakable in his unmaking, narrowing options to a single, irreversible choice. The storm's peak tightens pressure coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from the immortal's quest, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer to "what happens after goodbye" through the image of "a goodbye that had finally been witnessed." Subtext operates in motifs like absence and cessation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with a perceptual signature focused on cosmic and abstract imagery. POV is stable and single, with rhythmic control under pressure, such as in "the air folded. Not a tear, but an origami collapse." No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and no significant loops or artifacts. Minor overwriting in phrases like "dimensional awareness screaming as it was unspooled" is consistent and voice-motivated, not obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes immortality and spatial rebellion with specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the poetic, high-concept narrative heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure image of "a new scar in space" transforms familiar tropes.</comment>
