<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied micro-choices like tightening controls and extracting the arrow tip. However, interiority lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, limiting depth. The final realization is earned through causality, but the absence of internal conflict prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Kael reconfigures her understanding of resilience, with cost legible in the orchard's exposed vulnerability. The causal drive lens holds tightly from mission to discovery, and orientation is clear within the first 120 words. The arrow tip as a persistent constraint shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with floating rock arches and inverted rivers, constraining choices like navigation by water flow and anchoring to the boulder. The environment charges the final image of the pulsing tree, and sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered. Economy and integration into action are strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the causal lens, from searching to discovering the arrow tip's effect and realizing the symbiotic pact. The dominant stake of finding resilience's source tightens meaningfully, with cost legible in the orchard's vulnerability. No coincidental resolutions; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, with resilience as a learned response to invasive power, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the tree and stolen energy. Subtext operates in echoes and the arrow tip's reweighted meaning, inviting reflection without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending professional observation with poetic rhythm. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., echoes) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift, though dialogue is absent and internal voice could be more idiosyncratic at peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with clear propulsion and no major loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in phrases like "sweet decay and new growth" slightly muddles sense but doesn't harm closure. Figurative language is generally coherent and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravity inversion, bioluminescent flora, and echoes as consciousness feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific details, and risk-taking in the quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth in resilience theme avoids generic templates.</comment>
