<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and intensifies through his ritualistic tracking, with embodied emotions like the heart's quickening adding depth. His final shift to living as a prism is earned by prior causality, though minor lack of contradictory impulses in scene prevents a higher score. The donor heart's resonance serves as a subtle internal conflict, reinforcing his drive without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the accumulative/textural lens, closure is a conceptual repricing with cost legible in Elian's purpose change. The sun trails pattern builds cohesively, and orientation is anchored early. The illumination moment reweights prior material without exposition, satisfying the lens and cost proof test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice, as the morpho wing and tea house environment directly shape Elian's actions and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, with the valley-mist and light trails integrating into the thematic resonance. No generic or static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the accumulative lens through Elian's agency in tracking sun trails, culminating in the illumination that forces a trade-off in his motivation. Cost is visible in his foreclosed quest, with pressure cohering until the final reconfiguration. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the iridescent caution concept and the wing's transformation, offering a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates through image and implication, such as the heart's resonance echoing the donor's attention. The ending reweights prior material with purposeful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and stable, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Elian's watchful nature. POV control is consistent, and rhythmic modulation supports emotional beats without head-hopping. The prose's texture enhances the accumulative drive, with no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, such as "iridescent caution" and "detonated with light," without muddying peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and the closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of donor heart, dye mastery, and morpho wing feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the lyrical style heightening stakes. Specific details like sun trails and iridescent philosophy avoid template plots, and the closure transforms familiar themes through grounded particulars.</comment>
