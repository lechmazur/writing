<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to seal the covenant is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the alignment shiver. However, minor lack of internal conflict or contradictory impulses keeps it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with cost as the world tilts, under a causal lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the time pressure from the new regime shapes tactics, making the ending inevitable and resonant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory detail and constrains choices, such as the palace's decay and celestial alignment affecting Elias's actions. The tile and tools function as micro-settings that charge the final image, though minor descriptive excess exists.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are dominant and escalate through time pressure and celestial alignment, driven by Elias's agency. Cost is legible in the sealing moment, foreclosing other paths under the causal lens without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the bridge between empirical and ethereal, with subtext in actions and a resonant, non-literal ending that reweights prior material. No moralizing, but minor ambiguity in thematic depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature that reflects Elias's mindset. Rhythmic control under pressure and purposeful elision teach the pattern, paying off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing the story with clarity. Minor overwriting in phrases like "the frugal astronomer smiled" creates slight scaffold, but no artifacts harm closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of astronomy and mysticism, with specific details that feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming tropes through character.</comment>
