<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Maya's characterization is deeply embodied, with somatic trauma and gradual healing shown through micro-choices; the final framing of the photo is earned by prior causality, and contradictory impulses (freeze vs. transcendence) act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong; closure with Maya framing the photograph represents a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost in integration of past and present; orientation is early and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The arboretum setting is visceral and constraining, with salt-laced wind and resilient plants mirroring Maya's internal state and charging the final image; environment shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Maya's agency in gardening and confronting trauma under the accumulative lens; the transcendent freeze and subsequent action show cost in resilience, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of integration emerges organically through plant metaphors and the pearl of stillness concept; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is lyrical with a distinct perceptual signature; prose reflects Maya's inner world without head-hopping, and rhythmic control heightens pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is pristine, with varied rhythm and high density; no loops or artifacts, and figurative language enhances without obscuring clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, transforming trauma narrative through unique setting and somatic focus; risk-taking in internal focus pays off with non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
