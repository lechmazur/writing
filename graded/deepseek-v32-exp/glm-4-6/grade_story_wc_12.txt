<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Priest's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; internal conflict shown through embodied emotion like breath catching, but some abstraction limits depth of contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost (fragile victory) under accumulative/textural lens; orientation is clear early, and persistent constraints (loop pedal, silence) shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (chamber, anchor) and tools (palette, pedal) constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details are vivid and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by priest's agency (chanting, painting) under accumulative lens, increasing density; cost is legible as entity recoils and resolve wavers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from events and images (silence, sound) without moralizing; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through fragility of victory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic rhythm; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., rhetorical devices) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high density and varied rhythm without loops or muddle; figurative language is purposeful and supports pressure, clarity intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable; premise is transformed through specific details (loop pedal, rhetorical devices) and risks heighten stakes.</comment>
