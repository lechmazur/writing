<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and intensifies, rooted in her promise and mentor's disappearance. Interiority is concrete through the crystal vial and memories, showing internal conflict as she overrides instinct. The final choice to integrate with the temple is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in her physical destabilization. Minor weakness: emotions in peak beats could be more embodied, but no stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Decisive Change as Marina becomes the new distress signal sender, reconfiguring her purpose with conceptual cost. Causal lens holds strong, with events linked through her actions. Orientation is clear early, and the temple's energy field acts as a persistent constraint shaping tactics. Cost is unmistakable in the integration moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like crystalline spires and flowing water that reflect urgency. The underwater temple constrains choices (e.g., gravitational anomalies, temporal threads) and charges the final image through its consciousness. Micro-setting elements like the diving suit and vial are integrated into action, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of harnessing ephemeral energy escalates under causal lens through Marina's agency, with oxygen depletion and gravitational anomalies tightening options. Cost is legible as she destabilizes physically to unsnarl temporal threads. The final choice forecloses her former path with visible cost, driven by her decisions without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transformation and bridging worlds emerges through particulars like the vial and temple, without direct statement. Subtext operates in the gathered hush and memory touches. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer as Marina becomes the signal sender, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, filtering details through Marina's biases. Voice is poetic yet controlled, modulating under pressure. Minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven. Minor elision in temporal threads is taught and paid off at closure, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language (e.g., "gathered hush transforms into a symphony") is purposeful and clear. Sentence-level propulsion supports escalation, and closure image is sharp with no muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of space exploration, underwater temple, and memory-based transformation feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are subverted through specific choices like the vial as a tool for pathways. Risk-taking in non-linear consciousness integration heightens stakes without gimmickry, supporting coherence.</comment>
