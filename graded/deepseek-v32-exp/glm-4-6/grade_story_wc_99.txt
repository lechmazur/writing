<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kenji's motivation to find the color of unspoken apologies is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion (e.g., "cerulean regret washing over him"). Interiority is concrete, and his final stance crystallization is earned through prior causality, though some impulses could be more contradictory in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost ("cerulean regret... carrying him somewhere new"), under an accumulative/textural lens that holds. Orientation is clear early, and the ghost ship's compass persistently shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details (salt-laced air, wet earth) filtering through Kenji's POV. The islet, bonsai, and compass constrain choices and charge the final image, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is driven by Kenji's agency in tracing the lace and steadying the compass, with cost legible in the regret. One meaningful tightening occurs, but the stake remains internal without deeper external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of regret and possibility emerges through images and events, not statement, with a resonant non-literal answer in the compass pointing to the horizon. Subtext operates in implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and measured, fitting Kenji's character. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, and sentence-level rhythm supports the accumulative design without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the specific synthesis of bonsai, ghost compass, and lace to explore regret, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
