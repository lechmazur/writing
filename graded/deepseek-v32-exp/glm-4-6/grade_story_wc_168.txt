<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elias's characterization is deeply interior and embodied, with contradictions (shame vs. purpose) acting simultaneously. His final renunciation is earned through prior causality, and the cost is visible in the box's warmth and his realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Elias reframes his trauma, felt cost is legible in the realization scene. Accumulative lens holds throughout, with the persistent constraint of the box shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the moonlit ridge and cracked porcelain box constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through POV.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of trauma recovery through specific firefighter lens feels inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet reflection heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
