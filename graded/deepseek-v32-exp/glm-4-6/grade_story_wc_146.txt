<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The bell tuner's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with patient grace, but interiority remains limited, lacking contradictory impulses or deep internal conflict that would elevate the characterization further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the town's rebirth, under an accumulative lens where sound patterns build to a resonant reconfiguration; cost is felt in the transformation, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered through sensory details, with the archway and cobblestones actively constraining choices and charging the final image, integrating environment into the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the outset, escalation is driven by the tuner's agency through accumulating rhythm, and cost is legible in the town's revival, aligning with the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of rebirth through sound emerges organically from events and imagery, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, enriched by subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature focused on sound and light; voice remains consistent under pressure, and any elision serves the closure effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and dense, with strong rhythm and information density, but minor repetitive phrasing (e.g., "infinitely patient") slightly dulls momentum without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, transforming the ghost town revival trope through unique sound-based mechanics; synthesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
