<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and deeply personal, with embodied emotion in breaths catching and spatial imagination driving the quest. The final renunciation is earned through the psychometry journey, showing a credible endurance with visible cost in the bittersweet peace.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with orientation anchored early in the projection booth. Closure is a conceptual repricing—the realization that love is stored in "when"—landing with undeniable cost in the "bittersweet melody" and reconfiguring the premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory details like "scent of aged film and ozone" are selective and POV-filtered. The film strip as a micro-setting constrains choice and charges the final image as a "map" to the archive, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the gazer's active psychometry, under accumulative lens, culminating in a revelation that narrows options. Cost is legible in the "strange and powerful peace," showing a meaningful deepening driven by agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images like "goodbye letters written in motion," with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the conceptual repricing of unused love. No moralizing, and subtext operates in implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "folded spaces between moments." Voice is controlled and poetic, with rhythmic prose that heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, e.g., "silver serpent" coiled film. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies naturally, and figurative language coheres without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of unused love stored in temporal pockets feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like the film outtakes. Risk-taking in conceptual repricing heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
