<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to sculpt identity from experience is clear and drives his actions, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final resolve is earned, though internal conflict is minimal, fitting the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in the weight of revelation and preemptive nostalgia, under an accumulative lens. Orientation is clear early, and the fog as a persistent constraint shapes tactics, but a repetitive phrase in the final third caps the score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the solidified fog and forecourt constraining choices and charging the final image. The observatory and environment are integral to the revelation, but artifact cap applies.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes in preserving memory escalate under accumulative lens through Kael's agency in conjecture, leading to a cost-legible realization. The fog's timeline tightens pressure, but global artifact cap limits score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory and identity emerges through images and subtext, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer. No moralizing, but artifact cap prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and poetic voice, consistent under pressure. No head-hopping, but artifact cap applies due to repetitive phrase in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density, but the repetitive phrase "preemptively nostalgic" creates a template-cadence artifact, especially in key beats, dulling closure slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, with emotional truth in nostalgia and memory, transforming tropes through grounded details. Risk-taking in lyrical style pays off, but artifact cap applies.</comment>
