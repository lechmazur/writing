<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority and micro-choices under pressure, with embodied emotion; the mender's motivation is clear and consistent, though the daughter's "endearingly feisty" trait is told rather than shown, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as the seed trembles, offering Charged Poise under an accumulative lens; orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without contradiction, with the persistent constraint of the orchard shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details filtered through POV; the orchard setting constrains choice and charges the final image, with spatial choreography coherent and atmosphere tightly woven into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stake of mending the relationship is signaled early; under accumulative lens, escalation occurs through the planting action, which deepens and reweights options with visible cost, though external pressure is minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of deciduous vows emerges organically through symbols and actions, with subtext in gestures like planting the ribbon; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though the concept is occasionally explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping, enhancing emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, with clear propulsion and no artifacts obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable and fresh; the quartz-eye mender and cathedral orchard offer a non-obvious angle, with risk-taking in lyric mode heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
