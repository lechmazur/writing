<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. The final transformation is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her shedding identity. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her viewing exile as both curse and salvation, and the closure choice is deeply motivated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the transformation and the garden's magic loosening. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with gaps and patterns driving the narrative. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the structure is coherent with a meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The twilight garden and crystalline dome are vivid, sensory details that constrain Lyra's choices and charge the final image. The setting is integrated into action, with the obsidian stones and starlight amplifying the climax. Micro-setting elements like the moonstone dust speck actively shape tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transcending the Nostalgia Ban escalates through Lyra's dance and the moonstone's dissolution, driven by her agency under the accumulative lens. Cost is visible in the cellular transformation and the loosening of her anchor. One meaningful deepening changes knowledge and options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory, gaps, and transcendence emerges through concrete events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer by revealing what was never known, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in the dance and the luminous script.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature that reflects Lyra's focus on gaps and starlight. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and elision (e.g., in observing gaps) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the dance, and the closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes tide dancing, nostalgia ban, and cosmic verse in a non-obvious way that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in structure and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test passed; specific details anchor universals.</comment>
