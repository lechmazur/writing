<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, with interiority shown through concrete observations and micro-choices under pressure. Her final shift from debunking to excavating truth is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her changed worldview. However, some emotional beats rely on slight tell-y summary rather than full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with logical progression from investigation to revelation via shredded letters. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the diamond's flaw reconfigures meaning, with cost legible in Maya's decision to excavate truth. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and POV-filtered, with the orchard and diamond constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, integrating with action to mirror internal states and support theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth vs. deception escalates through Maya's agency in piecing together letters, leading to a meaningful tightening that forecloses her debunking path with cost. Pressure coheres under the causal lens, though the escalation is somewhat linear without major reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of imperfection as balance emerges organically through events and images, not statement, with the flawed diamond serving as a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext in the letters and Maya's epiphany avoids moralizing, offering complexity and lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—observational and analytical—that reflects Maya's profession and stress. Prose rhythm and diction remain consistent under pressure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops or artifacts obscure causality; figurative language is purposeful and coherent, though minor repetition in descriptive phrases slightly dulls momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of a flawed diamond as a stillpoint in a radioactive orchard is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in theme heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specific details anchor originality.</comment>
