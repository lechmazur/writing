<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and rooted in loss, with embodied actions like charting the lamp's hum, but lacks deep internal contradiction or flaws that complicate choices under pressure, limiting peak impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with Earned Stasis and felt cost of the town's silence, under a consistent Accumulative/Textural lens; the persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice—the lamp and bonsai labyrinth are essential to the method and closure, with sensory detail integrated into action and POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Silas's agency in refining temporal textures, under the Accumulative lens, with cost legible in the silence pressing against the mountain; one meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preservation emerges through particulars like the invented histories, with a resonant, non-literal answer in the final image of refracting time into gold, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, precise diction reflecting Silas's character—and no head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts; figurative language like "prism" and "gilded-leaf" serves clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of refracting time through lamp hum is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable; risk-taking in premise heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
