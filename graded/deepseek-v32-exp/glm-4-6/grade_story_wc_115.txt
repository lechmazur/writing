<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in guilt, with interiority shown through concrete actions like confessing and appraising the wheel. His final choice to turn the valve is earned by prior causality, with visible cost as the weight vanishes. Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. reliance on psychic tapes) act in scene, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost as the weight vanishes, under a causal lens where his confession leads to finding and turning the wheel. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The cost is legible in the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "peeling posters" and "cold stone" filtering through Elias's POV. The valve wheel constrains choice and charges the final image, as turning it releases his guilt, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal conflict over guilt, escalating through his confession and interaction with the wheel. Protagonist agency drives escalation under the causal lens, with cost legible as the burden lifts. Meets 9+ test with unmistakable cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of guilt and redemption emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in the valve wheel as a pressure valve. The ending offers a non-literal answer through the act of turning, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, evident in descriptive prose reflecting Elias's state. The psychic tape dialogue is integrated naturally, and elision (e.g., the confession details) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with high information density, but a generation artifact like "世界感的" (likely a typo for "world of") causes minor clarity loss. No major loops or scaffolds; rhythm supports pressure without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements like the psychic tape appraisal and "factory ghost shift" feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking with metaphysical concepts heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure reconfigures meaning.</comment>
