<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving his actions to capture the lunar morning. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as "dawnlit melancholy," and his final endurance is earned by prior causality. However, lacking strong internal conflict or contradictory impulses in scene prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elias preserves the moment amid era change, with cost legible in the "silent majesty" loss. Causal lens holds strong from motivation to climax, and orientation is clear early. The hourglass grain as persistent constraint shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lunar setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details like "lunar dust" and "spectrum of colors" filtered through POV. Environment constrains choice (summit climb, vacuum challenges) and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing last lunar morning) escalates through agency-driven actions like the chemical breakthrough and outlasting, with cost felt in exhaustion and melancholy. Under causal lens, one meaningful tightening occurs at the climax, but no major reversal limits a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of exploration's end emerges through particulars like the hourglass grain and commercialization, with subtext in imagery. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though "dawnlit melancholy" leans slightly explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, blending poetic and scientific tones. No dialogue, but prose reflects Elias's mind under pressure. Minor register consistency in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has varied rhythm and high information density, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "ethereal light" is controlled and voice-motivated. Slight purple tinge in "dawnlit melancholy" does not harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lunar inspection and heritage elements feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet climax with charged poise, but lacks transformative boldness for highest band.</comment>
