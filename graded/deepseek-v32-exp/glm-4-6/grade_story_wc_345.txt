<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lack of individual character depth and interiority, with no contradictory impulses or embodied emotions for specific characters; collective motivation is clear but underdeveloped, reducing impact on pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong causal drive with coherent because/therefore linkages; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with legible cost in the Gardener's fading and community transformation, and the lens holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vivid, specific setting with floating arches and nebula that actively constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details are selective but could be more integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by collective agency under causal lens, with discoveries tightening stakes; cost is legible in the community's transformation and Gardener's sacrifice, though individual trade-offs are muted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of trust and collective purpose emerges organically from symbols and events; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reinforced by the chalk messages' continuity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with clear focalization on the community, but lacks distinct perceptual signature or voice modulation under pressure; dialogue is minimal and functional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmic with good momentum, though some summary passages reduce density; no major artifacts or loops, and closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi and spiritual elements with specific details like the watering bell network; transforms tropes through grounded community focus, though risk-taking is moderate.</comment>
