<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Jonah's reticence and warmly observant nature are consistently embodied, driving micro-choices like pocketing the sea glass and stacking stones. His internal conflict between loneliness and desire for connection is shown through specific, contradictory impulses in scene, not summary. The final renunciation (stacking stones as a silent message) is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his lifted reticence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with patterns of letters, sea glass, and stones building to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible in the final image of the sea glass scattering light. The persistent constraint of loneliness shapes tactics and the ending, making closure feel inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposeful, with the lighthouse and sea filtering through Jonah's POV to constrain choices (e.g., the lantern room's heaviness pressures relighting). The sea glass as a micro-setting object charges the final image by reweighting meaning. Details are economical and integrated into action, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of emotional safety escalates under the Accumulative lens through Jonah's agency in relighting the lamp and stacking stones. Cost is unmistakable in his longing and the quiet understanding achieved. A single meaningful deepening changes knowledge and reweights options, with no coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of connection through quiet communication emerges organically from particulars like the letters and sea glass, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of scattered light and stacked stones. Subtext operates in gestures and implications, resisting tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature reflective of Jonah's reticent, observant nature. Prose rhythm and diction are controlled under pressure, and any elision (e.g., anonymous sender) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language (e.g., "luminescent ache") is purposeful and coherent, enhancing clarity. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with emotional beats, and the closure image is undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar tropes (haunted lighthouse, anonymous letters) through specific, grounded choices in character and motif. Risk-taking in subtle, accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry. The non-obvious connection between elements feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
