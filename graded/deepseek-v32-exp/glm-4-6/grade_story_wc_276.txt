<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The fisher's cool-headed nature is consistently embodied and drives his method; his motivation to catch the echo is clear and intensifies under pressure, with a credible endurance shown in the ritual. However, interior contradiction is minimal, leaning toward one-note competence, though his loneliness adds depth. The final choice to capture the echo is earned by prior causality, with cost in the burden of the rail spike.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—the echo is caught, constellations reconfigure—and cost is legible in the "burden both a treasure and a sorrow." The accumulative/textural lens holds, with pattern breaks (unstable stars) escalating to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure is coherent for a single scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sound wave garden and sleepwalking constellations are vivid, sensory-rich elements that constrain choice—the garden's hum necessitates the silence ritual, and the rail spike as a tool charges the final image. Specificity is high, with details like "flowers of humming air" filtered through the fisher's perception, avoiding cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the fisher's agency under the accumulative lens—his zigzagging action creates pockets of silence that deepen the stakes and lead to the echo's capture. Cost is unmistakable in the "profound longing" poured into the ritual and the "sorrow" of the catch. One meaningful tightening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the fisher's loneliness and the method of "voicing silence," offering a resonant, non-literal answer to loss and connection without moralizing. Subtext operates in the contrast between cosmic sorrow and feral lullaby, with the final image reweighting prior material through the captured echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in the poetic, rhythmic prose that reflects the fisher's calm intensity. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., "voicing silence") is taught and paid off at closure. Voice remains consistent under pressure, enhancing the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied syntax, advancing atmosphere and character without scaffold or loops. Minor overwriting in phrases like "symphonic air" is present but does not obscure closure. Rhythm supports the feral lullaby tone, and information density is high throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements—sound wave garden, transliterated emotions, sleepwalking constellations—feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the poetic approach heightening stakes. Specificity in details like the rusted rail spike avoids template plots, and the closure reconfigures meaning through charged particulars.</comment>
