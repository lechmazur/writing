<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his role as storm herald, but interiority lacks concrete micro-choices under pressure; emotions are told rather than embodied, and no significant change or internal conflict is dramatized on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure lands with resonant reconfiguration as shadows mingle with dawn light, charging the final image with conceptual cost; orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse and glass wick function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the finale; sensory details are vivid and purposeful, with the wick's light-song integral to the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kaelen's agency in steering light, deepening stakes through accumulative density; cost is legible in the shadows influencing human choices, aligning with the textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of ancient wisdom versus digital ephemera emerges organically through images and actions; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, supported by subtext in the prophetic shadows.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature; voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., the routine's ancient origins) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with strong rhythm and high information density; no major loops or scaffolds, and figurative language coheres without muddling clarity in peak beats like the final shadow formation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh specificity; the storm herald's role and light-steering mechanism feel organic and inevitable, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
