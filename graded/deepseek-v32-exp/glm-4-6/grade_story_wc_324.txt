<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Aria's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her "persistently curious" nature, which compels her to investigate and protect vulnerable voices. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like "the familiar pull in her chest," and her transformation to incidental heroism is earned through causal actions. The final choice to present documents is motivated by prior discoveries, with visible cost in the relief felt at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with cost: Aria uncovers the truth, reconfiguring Margaret's story with relief. The causal lens holds tightly, from investigation to revelation, with no orientation issues. The persistent constraint of Aria's curiosity shapes tactics, and the cost is legible in the "reeling hush" that shifts from sorrow to relief.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is vividly rendered and pressures choices by thinning boundaries between worlds, enabling Aria's work. Key objects like the hearing aid and photograph constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Aria's professional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering truth escalates through Aria's agency, driven by her curiosity and the pulses from the hearing aid. The tightening occurs when she finds documents, foreclosing ignorance with cost in the relief. Agency is clear, and the cost is unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth and justice emerges organically from events, such as the scratched-out photo and hidden documents, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the revelation, reweighting prior material with complexity. Subtext operates in implications, like the sister's institutionalization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, lyrical voice that modulates under pressure. Perception is character-specific, and elision (e.g., the scratched-out features) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; prose rhythm supports emotional beats, as in "the reeling hush of the atrium."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density and varied sentence rhythm. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is controlled and purposeful, e.g., "twilight deepened, creating the perfect atmospheric conditions." Read-aloud ear test passes with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of a contact tracer for hearts is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific details like emotional imprints and the hearing aid. Risk-taking in the mystical premise heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure is fully integrated.</comment>
