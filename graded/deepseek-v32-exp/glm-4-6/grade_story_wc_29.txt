<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her expertise and isolation. Her micro-choices, like repurposing subsonic technology, reveal her values under pressure. The final action feels earned by prior causality, though interior contradiction is minimal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost—"celestial silence" signifies victory after risking her career—under a causal lens. The plot escalates logically from discovery to interference, with orientation anchored early. Persistent constraints like funding threats shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The university radio station constrains choices through secrecy and resources, with sensory details like "dim glow" and astronomical charts. However, the environment doesn't deeply charge the final image, limiting higher band entry.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens, from interpreting signals to executing subsonic interference. The cost—career risk and community division—is legible on the page, foreclosing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through the conflict between deception and evidence, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the restored "celestial silence." Subtext in signal responsiveness to human psychology enriches without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a consistent scientific voice, and perceptual signature is clear in Elara's focused observations. No head-hopping or dialogue, but voice remains distinct under pressure without experimental risks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. No major artifacts like loops or scaffold; sentences advance plot and character efficiently, though minor telling occurs in climax summary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of cosmic tricksters and subsonic interference is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in premise heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and specificity anchors the narrative.</comment>
