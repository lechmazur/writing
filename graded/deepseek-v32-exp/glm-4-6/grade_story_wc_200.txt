<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion like "luminous ache." Micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing the tooth's ridges, reveal hierarchy of values. However, lacks contradictory impulses in scene, and emotional progression is serene without significant internal conflict, preventing higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as collector leaves tooth and moves forward, a Resonant Reconfiguration under accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and lens holds without ambiguity. Persistent constraint of gorge's acoustics shapes tactics, and cost is legible in "heart carried the laughter."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices through gorge's acoustics and tooth as micro-setting, charging final image when pressed into earth. Sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, like "cliffs swallowed sound." Environment actively guides method and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by collector's agency under accumulative lens, with each spirit encounter deepening stakes and cost legible in emotional weight. Dominant stake of healing souls tightens through encounters, but lacks a decisive turn that forecloses options, capping score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of healing through laughter emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in gestures like laughter weaving into essence. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though "luminous ache" veers slightly toward stated theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with poetic, rhythmic control under pressure; POV is stable and voice coherent. Elision taught early pays off in closure, and diction remains within character lexicon without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, though minor purple tinge in peaks like "luminous ache" slightly reduces propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of soul collector and laughter healing feels inevitable, with specific details enriching concept. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes, but lacks bold structural innovation, limiting higher band.</comment>
