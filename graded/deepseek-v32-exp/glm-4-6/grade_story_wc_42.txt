<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his methodical repair ethos, intensifying under pressure to compel high-stakes choices. Interiority is concrete and embodied, such as "chest heaving" with relief, though lacks contradictory impulses in scene. Final choice to restructure the clock is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the station's stabilization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (observatory stabilized) and felt cost (Kael's exhaustion and prior danger). Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages from problem to solution. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraint (orbit decay) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "humming" and "tremors" filtering through Kael's POV. The lunar observatory and biodome constrain choices and charge the final image, though micro-setting elements like the leaf could be more integrated into earlier beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survival) escalates under causal lens via worsening tremors and time pressure, driven by Kael's agency. Cost is legible in the station's near-collapse and his frantic efforts, with one meaningful tightening that forecloses options and leads to resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of harnessing the ephemeral emerges organically from events and images, such as the leaf's fall reweighting meaning at the end. Subtext operates through implication, and the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though it leans slightly overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature tied to Kael's expertise. Purposeful compression and rhythmic control under pressure are evident, with no head-hopping or clarity issues, though some lyrical density may border on overwriting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without major loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, but minor overwriting in peaks (e.g., "luminous ache" repetition) slightly dulls clarity without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending sci-fi with poetic mysticism, offering a fresh synthesis where the leaf sound solution feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in tone and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
