<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is strong with clear internal conflict between her pacifism and her father's violence, embodied in micro-choices like sheathing the knife. Motivation is consistent and drives her actions, with earned endurance in her tranquil blaze. However, some perception details feel slightly over-stated, limiting peak emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an accumulative/textural lens, with cost felt in her daily sacrifices and the weight of her choices. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, though the plot lacks causal turns, fitting the mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the glass dome and roses constraining Elara's choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through her POV, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, stakes escalate through density increase in her routines and the approaching merchants, driven by her agency in renunciation. Cost is legible in her embodied actions, but escalation is subtle without major tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of peace versus violence emerges organically through images and actions, with subtext in objects like the knife and sandbag. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the tranquil blaze concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature in Elara's noticing patterns. Voice is coherent and rhythmically controlled, though no dialogue is present. Elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet clear, with high information density and varied rhythms. No significant artifacts, loops, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and atmosphere efficiently, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes familiar elements with freshness through specific details like plant inculcation and the sandbag scrap. Emotional truth is strong, but some tropes are only moderately transformed, limiting ingenuity.</comment>
