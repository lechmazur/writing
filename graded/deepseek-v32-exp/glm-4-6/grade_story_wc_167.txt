<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through concrete actions like stone-skipping. Micro-choices under pressure reveal values, and the final endurance is earned with visible cost. However, internal contradiction is minimal, and emotional progression is somewhat linear, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (conceptual repricing) with felt cost in the fleeting beauty motif. The accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with patterns in ripples driving revelation. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the final image of transience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory detail (e.g., "milky light," "wet sand") and constrains choice by serving as the glazier's canvas. The prism atrium in mist recurs and charges the final image, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (finding value in mundane), and escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens through ripple interpretations. Cost is unmistakable in the transient nature of insights, but the pressure coheres without multiple reversals, fitting the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars like the ripples and glazier's reflections, offering a non-literal answer to valuing the ordinary. Subtext operates in imagery and implication, with no moralizing; the ending resonates without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects the glazier's worldview. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision (e.g., "noctilucent reckonings") is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and the closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of mundane observation with lyrical insight, transforming a simple act into profound revelation. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the perspective feels memorable and specific.</comment>
