<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation evolves credibly from professional curiosity to personal obsession, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. His final decision to broadcast the song is earned by prior causality, foreclosing his role as a neutral keeper with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The causal drive lens holds firmly, with clues like 2319 and the patch leading logically to the revelation. Closure is a decisive change where Elias becomes an "avenger," with cost legible in the risk taken, and the persistent constraint of corporate deletion shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
