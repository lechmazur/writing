<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her internal conflict and transformation from isolation to self-reliance are earned, though some emotions edge toward abstraction in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elara decides to become a guardian of memory, with felt cost in her acceptance. The accumulative lens holds, and orientation is clear early, though the drive could be more tightly causal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with the tidal library and sundial constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, but slight ornamentation prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in her brittle awakenings. The dominant stake of internal conflict tightens meaningfully, though external pressure is minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, offering a resonant answer to isolation versus independence without moralizing. Subtext operates through motifs like the sundial, but occasional explicit statements slightly reduce nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and stable, with poetic rhythm and controlled POV. The perceptual signature is strong, though dense lyricism at peaks may slightly obscure immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting and synonym churn occur (e.g., "brittle awakenings" repeated). No major artifacts harm closure, and information density is high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality is high with a fresh synthesis of tropes, such as the last Dragon-Kin in a tidal library. Specific details and risk-taking in style elevate the piece, though some concepts feel slightly familiar.</comment>
