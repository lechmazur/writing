<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to translate silence into music is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion (e.g., tear tracing cheek) and micro-choices (striking the fork) revealing hierarchy of values. Interior contradiction between grief and wonder acts simultaneously in scene, and the final earned shift to joy is rooted in prior causality. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing; character feels specific and flawed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) where the scanner's cascade of colors reweights silence into music, cost legible in her tear and laugh. Orientation is clear by ~120 words (capsize survivor in winterglass conservatory). Pattern taught early and paid off; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory constrains choice and charges the final image, serving as micro-setting that supplies resources (flowers for thermal scans) and mirrors internal state. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (frost-kissed panes, orchids under glass), filtered through POV. Spatial choreography is coherent; environment evolves with the experiment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of overcoming silence escalates under accumulative lens through protagonist's agency (persistent experimentation with tuning fork and scanner), leading to a decisive intensification where cost is felt in emotional release. No coincidence; pressure tightens via density increase in thermal patterns and vibrational feedback.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transforming loss into art emerges organically through particulars (thermal scans, tuning forks) without moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the scanner's symphony of warmth. Subtext operates in gesture and image (petals trembling). No thematic echo or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (poetic, sensory-driven voice) and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., storm backstory) is taught and paid off in closure. Diction remains within character's lexicon; free indirect style is clean.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("phantom symphony of chaos") is purposeful and coherent; no register drift or overwriting in peak beats. Closure image is sharp and undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Core premise of heat-mapping silence into music is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry; transformation through specific detail (tuning fork case, thermal scanner) avoids derivative templates.</comment>
