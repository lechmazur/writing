<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistently drives the narrative; his interiority is embodied through specific sensations like the "faint vibration" and "hollow ache," and his final endurance is earned by prior causality. However, the lack of contradictory impulses in scene slightly limits depth, though micro-choices under pressure (e.g., pressing his forehead for stability) reveal values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost—Elias's certainty "settled deep in his bones" reweights the premise. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory density; orientation is clear by ~120 words with the quartz arbor and car anchor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is integral and constrains choice: the quartz arbor provides tactile grounding, and the frost-patterned car window acts as a micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as the "cool, smooth stone" and "fern-like ice."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving objects absorb emotions) escalates under the accumulative lens through Elias's agency—the communion action narrows options and deepens knowledge. Cost is legible in the "battlefield of yesterday’s peace" and the emotional weight he carries.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept, with subtext in the "truthful lies" of reconstructed narratives. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of frost as "a battlefield," avoiding moralizing while reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature evident in phrases like "shifted hush" and "patterns of frost a different stanza." No head-hopping; elision (e.g., the prism's mechanics) is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, but minor figurative density in peaks (e.g., "shadows dance behind a screen") slightly mutes clarity. No loops or scaffold; propulsion remains strong through concrete actions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of emotion-as-repository, executed with specificity through the frost method. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
