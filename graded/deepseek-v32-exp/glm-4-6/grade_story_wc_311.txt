<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reaper's heartbreak is concretely embodied through trembling fingers and hitched breath; micro-choices in naming fears reveal value hierarchy; final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost in chest ache and lighter grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure as Charged Poise with legible cost in "weight of his grief remained, lighter now"; orientation anchors who, where, when early; persistent constraint of duty/grief shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Observatory dome's cracked light enables crystallization method, constraining choice; atlas page and sea monsters recur with reweighted meaning in final image; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of overcoming grief escalates through protagonist's agency in naming each fear; cost is unmistakable in pain becoming "more tangible"; accumulative density increase reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of naming fears emerges from particulars like sea monsters as memories; ending offers non-literal answer through crystallized monsters and stars without moralizing; subtext operates in image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature biases perception (e.g., sea monsters as "echo of sacrifice"); rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has varied rhythm and high information density; no loops or scaffolds; figurative language like "inked agony" is consistent and purposeful; clarity maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reaper mythos with psychological naming ritual; specific details (atlas page, observatory) avoid template; risk-taking in lyrical accumulation pays off with inevitable closure.</comment>
