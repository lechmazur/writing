<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character's migrating identity is concretely embodied through micro-choices like smelting fish, but interiority leans symbolic, lacking individual flaws or irrationality under pressure, which limits depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure via Charged Poise as Elara completes the ritual and passes the creel, with cost legible in the smoothed identity migrations over centuries.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tidal atrium constrains choices through tidal rhythms and gears; sensory details like "gleaming like distant memories" are selective and charge the final image of transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by librarian's agency in smelting and inscribing under accumulative lens; cost is visible in the cyclical identity shifts that preserve wonder.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom in contradictions emerges through smelting and identity migration; ending offers non-literal resonance without moralizing, e.g., "wonder could survive."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is strong in phrases like "wintersun serenity," and elision (e.g., identity shifts) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds, and figurative language like "ponderous grace" is coherent and purposeful in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of migrating identities and mechanical grandeur feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
