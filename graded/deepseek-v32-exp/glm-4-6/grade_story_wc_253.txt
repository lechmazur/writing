<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final act of placing the hummingbird is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the risk of rebellion. Contradictory impulses of compliance and resistance act simultaneously in scene, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens, as the hummingbird among flowers symbolizes ongoing resistance with felt cost. The structure builds through patterned images, and orientation is clear early. The ending reweights meaning without exposition, and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the wind turbines and farmhouse creating an oppressive atmosphere that constrains choices. Micro-setting elements like the dried flowers and carvings charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Elara's POV, enhancing tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of personal freedom vs. state control escalates through the unscheduled inspector visit, driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the risk taken, and the stakes deepen meaningfully through repeated acts of rebellion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of grief and authenticity emerges organically from actions and images, not direct statement. Subtext operates in Elara's narration and secret acts, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer. No moralizing; complexity is embraced through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature in Elara's voice. The poetic tone modulates with pressure, and elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; dialogue, when present, is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is effective and coherent, and sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative build. Closure image is clear and undulled by line-level issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The concept of the happiness mandate is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. Originality lies in the synthesis of dystopian elements with intimate acts of resistance, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in quiet rebellion heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
