<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure driving the arc from grief to reawakening. The final choice to play and not flee is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the statues' crumbling. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her silent grief versus the challenge in her music.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—the city's transformation—under a causal lens, felt through the statues' destruction and mechanisms ceasing. Orientation is clear early, and the locust shell's introduction, while sudden, integrates causally. Cost is legible in the final image of the vine growing from the shell.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the sky-bridge and orchard constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "rust and glass" and the locust shell's "brittle edges" are filtered through POV, and the environment pressures tactics, such as her movement through the statues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from playing the violin to the statues responding and the city pausing. Cost is unmistakable in the statues' crumbling and the world's reawakening. Stakes are clear and tighten through her actions, foreclosing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of reawakening beauty emerges from events and images, not statement, with the locust shell and music offering a non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gestures like the statue's nod, and the ending reweights prior material without moralizing, resonating through the vine's growth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in the poetic, lyrical voice. Rhythm and diction reflect the violinist's state, and elision (e.g., orchard backstory) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Minor repetitions of "resonantly soft" serve as motif but do not obscure clarity. No major artifacts or loops; propulsion is clear, though slight overwriting in peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of dystopian and magical elements, with the locust shell and heart rhythms transforming tropes. Risk-taking in lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable from prior particulars.</comment>
