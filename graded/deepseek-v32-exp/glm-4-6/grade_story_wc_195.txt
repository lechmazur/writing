<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied emotion and earned change; however, interior contradiction is subtle rather than strongly dramatized, limiting the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with cost under an accumulative/textural lens; the unsnapping of the gear reconfigures reality with felt weight, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices (orchard responds to patterns) and charging the final image (greenhouse dissolves); sensory detail is selective and integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through protagonist agency under the accumulative lens; cost is legible in the shattered night and transformed allegiance, though escalation is more pattern-based than causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the gear and allegiance, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to possibility; avoids moralizing but leans slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively lyrical, with perceptual signature and rhythmic control; no head-hopping, and elision (e.g., reality shifts) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high density and propulsion with varied rhythm; minor overwriting ("factually mystical") does not harm clarity or closure, and no loops or scaffolds detract.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes knight, orchard, and marionette elements with non-obvious ingenuity; risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
