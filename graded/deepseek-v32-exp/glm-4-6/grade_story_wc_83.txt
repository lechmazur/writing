<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, with contradictory impulses (exhilaration vs. horror) acting in scene. Interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., "bleak exhilaration" and thumbing the geode. Final choice to descend is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in emotional state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise with cost legible in "anticipatory horror and ecstasy." Causal drive lens holds strong from past trauma to hunt decision. Orientation is clear early; no disorientation. Persistent constraint of grief shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (floating observatory) constrains choices by enabling the mapper use; geode crystal charges the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered, e.g., "cool blue glow" and thermosphere isolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hunt for potential) escalates under causal lens from mapping to descending, narrowing options. Agency drives escalation; cost is unmistakable in emotional trade-off at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grief and potential emerges implicitly from events and images (geode, mapper). Ending offers non-literal answer through Elias's role as "cartographer," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice blends poetic and technical elements rhythmically. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., past trauma) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful; rhythm varies with pressure, e.g., in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes metaphysics and grief in a fresh, non-obvious way. Risk-taking in conceptual blend heightens stakes; turns feel inevitable in hindsight, e.g., geode resonating with hunt.</comment>
