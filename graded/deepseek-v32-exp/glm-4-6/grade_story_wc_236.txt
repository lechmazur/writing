<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority, such as her trembling hands and reliance on sight, driving her motivation to find meaning. Her internal conflict between grief and seeking purpose is dramatized through micro-choices like tracing the screw, and the final shift to hope is earned with visible cost in tears and steadying hands. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara's discovery of the inscription reconfigures her stance with felt cost—tears and scent return. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory details and object examination. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight from screw examination to revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered through selective sensory details like fog and water clock drips, filtered through Elara's POV. The screw as micro-setting constrains choice by driving the climax, and the workshop atmosphere charges the final image of fog lifting. Purposeful detail without ornamentation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake in Elara's internal conflict escalates through her agency in examining the screw, leading to the inscription discovery that narrows options and deepens knowledge. Cost is unmistakable in her emotional release and renewed strength. Under Accumulative lens, density increase reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of ordinary miracles emerges organically from the screw's revelation and Elara's arc, with subtext in gestures and images. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of hidden inscriptions, avoiding moralizing. Earned through concrete particulars and struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a lyrical, perceptual signature reflecting Elara's sensory loss. Voice modulates under pressure, and rhythmic control heightens emotional beats without head-hopping. Purposeful elision in examining occluded views pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "gears lay like scattered constellations" is coherent and voice-motivated. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality lies in the specific synthesis of aromatherapist loss, midwife's screw, and water clock motif, transforming grief tropes through grounded detail. Emotional truth and risk-taking in quiet narrative yield inevitability, though not groundbreaking.</comment>
