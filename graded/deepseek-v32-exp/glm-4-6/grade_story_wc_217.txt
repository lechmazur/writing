<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Poet's motivation is clear and consistent, driving key choices like weaving the feather and string. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with emotions shown through attentive touch and action. The final transformation is earned by prior causality, with cost in accepting impermanence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost in the sculpture's fleetingness. Orientation is clear early, and the snapped kite string triggers a meaningful tightening that leads to the poet's purposeful act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the lagoon and objects like the feather constraining choices and charging the final image. Details are purposefully filtered through the poet's POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding beauty in incompleteness escalates through poet's agency in responding to the snapped string. Cost is legible in the acceptance of transformation and impermanence, under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in the weaving act. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the sculpture's fate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature. Prose rhythm and diction are controlled under pressure, and any elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and no figurative muddle. Minor overwriting doesn't harm clarity or closure, and there are no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like the woven sculpture. Risk-taking in the quiet resolution heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and synthesis is organic.</comment>
