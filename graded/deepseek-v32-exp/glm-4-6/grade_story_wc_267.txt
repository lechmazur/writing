<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bellhop's motivation to understand safety's cost is clear and drives the plot, with embodied emotion (e.g., hands trembling) and micro-choices (pocketing the bolt) under pressure. His final resolve to remain is earned by prior causality, foreclosing escape with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis with felt cost in the "cold, quiet fire" realization, under a consistent Causal lens. The plot escalates through because/therefore linkages (silence prompts investigation, bolt discovery unlocks truth). Orientation is clear early, and the ledger reveal reconfigures stakes without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with the cobalt fortress and snow pressuring the bellhop's actions. Sensory details (e.g., crunch of snow, hum of machines) are selective and purposeful, woven through POV perception. The piano and staircase function as micro-settings that alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens, from noticing the silence to unlocking the piano and discovering the ledger. The cost of erasure is unmistakable on the page, tightening the dominant stake of safety versus sacrifice. No coincidental resolutions; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence as erasure emerges through events and images (piano, ledger), not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the bellhop's resolved endurance, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, such as the "unpardonable silence" representing systemic control.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic prose (e.g., "seraphically mundane") and heightened sensory focus. Voice remains coherent under pressure, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping. Elision (e.g., nerve regeneration backstory) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and vivid imagery, but minor overwriting (e.g., "frostbitten hope") slightly dulls peak beats without harming clarity. Rhythm varies naturally, and there are no loops or scaffold artifacts. Sentence-level propulsion advances story momentum effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes unique elements (silent-choir, nerve regeneration) with specificity, transforming tropes through grounded choices. Risk-taking in poetic diction heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
