<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal his hierarchy of values. The final choice to disintegrate the fragment is earned by prior causality, with visible cost when he sees his wife vanish. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the maze dissolves and Elias is left alone, with felt cost in the emptiness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through imagery and emotional density. Orientation is clear early, and the hyperbolic geometry shapes tactics persistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The living bridge garden constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details woven through action. The hyperbolic geometry pressures Elias's movement, and the environment evolves causally with events, avoiding static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the Accumulative lens, with a meaningful tightening as he battles the garden's shifts. Cost is legible when the photographs crumble and his wife disappears, foreclosing the past with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of time and memory emerges through particulars like the fading photographs and halo fragment, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of empty ruins, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm and diction reflect Elias's stressed state. Purposeful compression and lyrical density are taught early and pay off at closure, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythm. Minor figurative language in peak beats ("shimmering sliver of heaven") is consistent and voice-motivated, without obscuring closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of maze design, mystical elements, and psychological trauma feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in hyperbolic geometry and retrocognitive trapping heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure image is bold and specific.</comment>
