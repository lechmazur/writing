<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The machinist's motives are clear and consistent, with embodied interiority (e.g., hands trembling from anticipation) and micro-choices under pressure. His final decision to recalibrate the floodgate is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost. However, the trait "slyly heartfelt" feels occasionally label-like rather than fully dramatized in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands with felt cost as he decides to harmonize duty and guilt, under a causal lens that holds throughout. The chain and message drive a coherent plot, but the high-band cap applies due to Q7 falling below 8.2, though no closure harm occurs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details (geothermal warmth, dappled light) and the chain constraining choice and charging the final image. The amphitheater's breathing mirrors internal states, but the high-band cap applies from Q7.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early, and escalation is driven by agency under the causal lens, with cost legible in the decision's weight. The chain's revelation tightens options meaningfully, but the high-band cap applies due to Q7.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events, with subtext in the chain as empathy measure. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer, though the final line slightly moralizes without heavy-handedness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with lyrical prose and character-specific perception. Rhythmic control supports pressure, and no head-hopping occurs, but the high-band cap applies from Q7.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with strong rhythm, but minor overwriting occurs, such as "dappled resolve" creating register drift and strained metaphor. No loops obscure closure, but artifacts prevent higher scores.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements feel organic and specific, with the chain and encrypted compassion transforming tropes through grounded choices. The synthesis is inevitable in hindsight, and emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
