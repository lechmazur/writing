<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tomas's motivation is clear and rooted in his burden, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His final action—saving the traveler—is earned by prior causality, and internal conflict is shown through his reluctant duty. The graceless beauty of his actions reinforces his characterization without diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the orchard dims and frost touches Tomas, reconfiguring his role with cost. The causal drive lens holds tightly from blueprint to device use, and orientation is clear early. The persistent constraint of the curse shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the cliffside labyrinth and mechanical birds pressuring choices and charging the final image.

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Tomas's agency under the causal lens, from assembling the device to using his gift, with cost legible in the frost on his fingertips. The dominant stake of saving travelers tightens meaningfully, and the resolution forecloses paths with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the "graceless beauty" of salvation, with subtext in the orchard's approval dimming. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through Tomas's sacrifice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature evident in phrases like "wings that cut the air like razors."

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with vivid imagery and no loops or scaffold issues.
