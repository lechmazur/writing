<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Silen's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. The final unlocking feels earned by prior attempts, though minor theatricality slightly reduces authenticity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (diary opening reconfigures empathy path) under an accumulative/textural lens, cost legible in "trembling hands." Orientation is clear early, and causality holds without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the workshop and tools constraining choices (e.g., frequency generators shaping tactics). Sensory details are selective and charged in the final image of released silence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Silen's agency in frequency attempts, tightening under time pressure from fireworks. Cost is felt in the breakthrough, though one minor repetition in attempts slightly reduces intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of empathy through silence emerges organically from events, with subtext in the unlocking process. Final image reweights prior material without moralizing, offering a resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct (theatrical yet sincere), with a perceptual signature in describing silences. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and density, with minor overwriting in phrases like "theatrical sincerity" but no major artifacts. Closure image remains clear and propelled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and specific, synthesizing silence, frequencies, and empathy with inevitability. Risk-taking in premise heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
