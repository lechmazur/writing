<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The summoner's motivation is clear and rooted in the prophecy, with interiority shown through embodied focus and micro-choices under pressure. His final renunciation of sound for silence is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the transformation of the crane. However, some emotional states are abstractly described, lacking specific contradiction in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the sphere contains the silence, reconfiguring options with felt cost under the Accumulative lens. The drive lens holds consistently, and orientation is anchored early. The persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory detail, and the nocturnal haven constrains choice by providing the stillness needed for the ritual. The brook's murmur charges the final image as it softens post-closure. However, some descriptions edge toward ornamental without tightening pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the summoner's agency under the Accumulative lens, with one meaningful tightening as the crane transforms into a sphere, foreclosing the prophecy with visible cost. The dominant stake of silencing sound is clear, but the middle beats lack a sharp reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images of silence and peace, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the conflict between sound and silence. Subtext operates in gestures like the crane's flight, avoiding moralizing. The final image reweights prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects the summoner's focus. Rhythm and diction control under pressure heighten the accumulative effect. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative but purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. No major artifacts or loops; closure image remains clear. Minor overwriting in mid-beats with stacked metaphors, but without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of mapping silence and using origami is fresh and specific, synthesizing familiar elements into a non-obvious whole. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. The transformation feels inevitable in hindsight, with bold commitment to the premise.</comment>
