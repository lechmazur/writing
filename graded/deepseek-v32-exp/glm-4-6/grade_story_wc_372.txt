<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and trait-consistent, driving the narrative, but she lacks internal contradiction or flaws, rendering her slightly one-dimensional under pressure without genuine struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as the Great Forgetting arrives, and the accumulative lens holds with urgency building through the fading vows; the final image of suspended meaning reconfigures stakes with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The frozen library setting constrains Elara's choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details like "crystalline hush" integrated into action and pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the dimming luminosity and urgency, driven by Elara's agency in measuring vows, with cost legible in their dissolution and her exhaustion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory and meaning emerges from concrete actions without moralizing, with the ending offering a resonant non-literal answer through the preservation of vows.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice remains consistent and poetic, with elision taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and rhythmic, but minor repetition in phrases like "crystalline hush" and "luminous vows" slightly reduces density without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of a frozen library and luminous vows offers a fresh synthesis, though it doesn't radically transform tropes; specificity in details like frequency sampling adds ingenuity.</comment>
