<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mirage painter's motivation is clear and rooted in her unique traits, with the borrowed heartbeat adding depth. Interiority is concrete, though contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene. The final endurance of the mirage's dissolution feels earned, with cost in ephemerality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as the mirage dissolves and affects the girl, reweighting possibility with felt cost under the accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prism parapet and echoing terrace constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details purposefully filtered through the painter's POV. Specificity is high, and the setting evolves with the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation builds through density increase toward the bells' ring, with the painter's agency in creating the mirage. Cost is legible in the dissolution, though the stake is more thematic than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the painter's actions and the final image, offering a resonant exploration of possibility without moralizing. Subtext in the coded lullabies and mirrors deepens the thematic weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and poetic voice. Elision in the lyrical style is taught and pays off at closure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied rhythm, advancing story and atmosphere. No significant loops or artifacts, though minor overwriting in figurative language doesn't harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of mirage painting with a borrowed heartbeat is fresh and organic, synthesized through specific details. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
