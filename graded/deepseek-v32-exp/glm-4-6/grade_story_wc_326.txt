<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in survival guilt, with embodied emotion in micro-choices like tapping the shard. His relationship with Aris forces a stance crystallization, earning the final endurance. Minor weakness: some interiority leans told, but closure choice is credible with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in "survival itself is the wisdom." Accumulative/textural lens holds via ink and heartbeat patterns. Orientation is clear early; persistent constraints (shard, heartbeats) shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image—opal observatory and snow create pressure, while ink patterns and shard are micro-settings that alter tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under accumulative lens, with defragmentation tightening stakes through revealed memories. Cost is legible in the reconfigured understanding of failure. One meaningful deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like heartbeats and ink, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on wisdom from failure. Subtext operates in silence and image; no moralizing, with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled under pressure. Dialogue (though minimal) is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of digital ghost and defragmentation through ink feels inevitable, with risk-taking in quiet closure. Specificity in details (porcelain shard, heartbeats) avoids template plots, heightening stakes.</comment>
