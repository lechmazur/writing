<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies through solemnization acts; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "lucidly watchful"); change from conflicted to resolved is earned through causality, though some abstraction in hope collection slightly limits depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative drive lens holds; closure is a decisive change with cost legible in his transformation into a "conduit"; structure is coherent with one meaningful tightening through hope collection, though the feral nexus's rules are somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices (e.g., wading against the current); sensory details are purposeful and charge the final image; the feral nexus acts as a micro-setting that alters tactics and supports theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (overcoming writer's block) escalates through protagonist's agency in solemnizing hopes; cost is felt in the effort and attention required; under accumulative lens, density increases with each hope collected.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of writing as hope collection emerges organically through events and images; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext in hope shapes (e.g., "orb of acceptance") deepens reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and consistent, modulating with pressure; no head-hopping; elision in mystical elements is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; minor overwriting in phrases like "impossible geometry of longing" but no major artifacts or loops; clarity and propulsion are maintained, especially in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of mystical and creative struggles; tropes are transformed through specific details (e.g., hope shapes); risk-taking in surreal elements heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; originality feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
