<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to collect burdens is clear and intensifies, driving her irreversible calcification. However, interiority lacks embodied contradiction under pressure, with emotions sometimes abstract rather than concretely felt. The final choice is earned by prior causality with visible cost of being trapped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in "boundary-lessly trapped" and cyclical imprisonment. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through layered burdens to a decisive change. Orientation is clear early, and the grotto's constraints shape the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bronze grotto setting is indispensable, constraining choices through its mathematical properties and starlight mechanics. Sensory details like "pulsing metallic veins" are vivid and purposeful, charging the final image of calcified permanence. Environment actively pressures Elara's transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Elara's agency in calcifying, with cost unmistakable in her eternal trapping. The stake of collecting burdens tightens through the transformation, foreclosing her mortal path. Pressure coheres from initial call to irreversible change.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through burdens as measurable weights, offering a non-literal answer to universal understanding without moralizing. Subtext operates in images like "crystalline structures" of guilt, and the ending reweights prior material with conceptual cost. Resonance arises from particulars, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature, blending mathematical precision and poetic rhythm. Voice controls elision and compression, as in "whalebone reverie," without head-hopping. Diction remains character-bound, enhancing pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language like "layered silence" is consistent and purposeful, propelling momentum. Sentence-level craftsmanship supports the accumulative drive without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of fractal weaving and emotional burden collection, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical abstraction heightens stakes without gimmickry. The concept commits fully, transforming familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
