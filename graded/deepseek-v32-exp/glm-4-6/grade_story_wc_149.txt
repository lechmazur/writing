<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ghost bride's motivation is clear and embodied through paradox of mournful elation; botanist's remembrance earned via sensory triggers. Minor weakness: his characterization less developed, but closure choice credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with cost legible when bead drops and she fades. Bead as persistent constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orchard setting vividly atmospheric and sensory, but does not actively constrain choices; bead charges final image, yet environment remains decorative versus tactical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes clear from start; escalation driven by ghost's agency through cameo appearances, culminating in recognition scene with cost of her dissolution. Felt price on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of love and debt emerges through particulars like the bead and ephemeral touches; final image reweights without moralizing, offering resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Poetic voice consistent; POV shifts between ghost and botanist are legible at breaks. Minor convergence in elevated diction under stress, but perceptual signature distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose dense and rhythmic, but slight overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "lovingly venomous" repeated); no major loops or artifacts, closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost bride and alchemical orchard; trope transformed through specific memory-debt dynamic; risk-taking in accumulative structure pays off.</comment>
