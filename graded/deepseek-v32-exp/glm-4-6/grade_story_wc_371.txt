<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is deeply embodied through specific micro-choices (adjusting the shawl, planting seeds) and interior contradiction (soothing sharp observations). Her final shift to hope is earned by the encounter with the baker, with cost visible in the shared bread and lingering silence. The "creeping normality noticer" trait drives key decisions, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Elara's renewed hope and the bird's chirp, under an Accumulative lens. The baker's reveal tightens causality, and orientation is clear within 120 words. The final image of wildflowers and the tea house as a foundation reweights prior material without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the finale: the crumbling tea house and courtyard shape Elara's gardening, and sensory details (moss, phantom sweetness) are filtered through her POV. The environment evolves from ruin to foundation, directly supporting the closure's cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the Accumulative lens: her planting seeds leads to the baker's uncloaking, deepening stakes from personal absolution to shared renewal. Cost is legible in the bread's shared consumption and the seeds' uncertainty, narrowing options from isolation to connection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars like the bread and seeds, offering a non-literal answer to loss and renewal without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures (breaking bread) and the final image of wildflowers, reweighting the sacred in the ordinary with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature ("phantom sweetness of bread"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven ("I baked that"), advancing plot without exposition. Rhythmic control under pressure (heart thudding) and no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("crust a perfect map of forgotten streets") is purposeful and coherent, accelerating with scene needs. No artifacts obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements (normality noticer, guerrilla gardening, vanished bakery) feels inevitable and fresh, transforming tropes through specific detail. Risk-taking in quiet resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry, though the concept is slightly familiar.</comment>
