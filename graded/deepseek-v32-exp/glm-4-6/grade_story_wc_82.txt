<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with embodied emotion shown through actions like "his mind trembling." The contradictory impulse of knowing his work is a delusion yet continuing is earned, and the cost is felt in the final stasis. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis with visible cost in Elias's acknowledgment of his "beautiful madness." The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through repetitive ritual. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with one meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the floating isle and tea garden creating a resonant atmosphere. The quartz cranes as micro-setting charge the final image, though the environment doesn't heavily constrain choices. Details are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are dominant in reassembling Liora's dream, escalating through Elias's repeated polishing actions under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in his "descend into deeper sorrow." Agency drives the escalation, with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of grief and delusion emerges organically through images like the cranes, with subtext in Elias's ritual. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the final constellation image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic, rhythmic prose. No head-hopping; voice modulates with emotional pressure, and elision is purposeful, such as in the focused description of polishing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, e.g., "luminous torment." Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The concept of dream recording in quartz cranes is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Emotional truth and risk-taking in lyrical style heighten stakes without gimmickry, and the premise is fully committed to.</comment>
