<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The sentinel's motivation is clear but somewhat abstract, told rather than deeply shown; Lila and Marc's emotional shifts are embodied and earned, with micro-choices under pressure, but the sentinel lacks interior contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the couple reconciles, driven by causal actions under a hybrid lens; cost is legible in their synced steps and the sentinel's retreat, with orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (amber light, russet leaves) create atmosphere, but the setting primarily enriches tone rather than constraining choices; the burned letter charges the final image but pavilion is more decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes around the couple's conflict escalate through the sentinel's agency and the letter's resonance, tightening options; cost is felt in their emotional shift, though the sentinel's role slightly dilutes protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of destined mismatches and understanding emerges through concrete actions and the letter's subtext; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person omniscient POV with a poetic, consistent voice; perceptual signature is distinct in the sentinel's perspective, and minimal dialogue feels natural, but voice can be overly ornate at times.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with strong rhythm and high information density; no major artifacts, though minor purple prose ("hum with the weight of unspoken truths") doesn't harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original sentinel concept and emotional specificity refresh the reconciliation trope; synthesis feels inevitable, but risk-taking is moderate, leaning on familiar arcs without groundbreaking transformation.</comment>
