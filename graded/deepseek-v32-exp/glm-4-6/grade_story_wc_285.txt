<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Coachman's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as "his throat tight." The final choice to fulfill the promise is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the lifted vigil. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the promise is fulfilled, lifting the vigil with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, reinforced by the ticking gutters and fog. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the gutters shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the fog-bound river crossing and ticking gutters constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the coachman's POV, and the yarn needle functions as a micro-setting that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fulfilling the promise) escalates under the Accumulative lens through density increase (waiting, gutters ticking) and cadence shift (gutters stopping). Protagonist agency drives the escalation, with cost legible in the lifted weight and renewed serenity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory and promise emerges through events and images, not direct statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the yarn needle exchange. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, avoiding moralizing or thematic echoes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and controlled under pressure, with rhythmic prose reflecting the coachman's mindset. Dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision (e.g., gutters ticking) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythm and no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing atmosphere without muddle in peak beats. Read-aloud test passes smoothly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements like the yarn needle and palimpsest promise are organically synthesized into a fresh, non-obvious whole that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
