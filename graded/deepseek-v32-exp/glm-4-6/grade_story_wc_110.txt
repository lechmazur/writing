<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The registrar's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure, such as deciding to eavesdrop through symbols. His motivation intensifies from observation to intervention, compelling higher-stakes choices. The final invitation to tea is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his shifted solitude.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive lens holds, building through symbolic patterns to a Charged Poise closure where connection reconfigures isolation. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the registrar's felt loneliness giving way to shared silence. The persistent constraint of a post-verbal world shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the crystal whispering stones and projector lens filtering through POV to constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details like the hum of stones and rain-pooled forecourt are integrated into action, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of overcoming mistrust escalates through protagonist agency—the registrar's decision to step into the forecourt—under the accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable in the tension and relaxation of the figures, narrowing options from isolation to connection. One meaningful tightening deepens the stake with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of honesty freeing through silence emerges organically from symbols and actions, such as the doodles evolving into an unbroken circle.

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, selective attention to symbols and silence.

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with zero loops or scaffolds. Figurative language, like "shoulders knotting like tangled thread," is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and closure is sharpened by concise, vivid imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of a post-verbal world with symbolic communication, transforming tropes through specific details like the projector lens and doodles.
