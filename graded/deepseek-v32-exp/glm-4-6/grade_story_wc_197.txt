<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions like "trembling hands" revealing her under pressure. Her resourcefulness is shown through micro-choices, such as decoding puddle reflections, and the final act of broadcasting Marcus's speech is earned by prior causality. However, some traits are told rather than shown, like "carefully resourceful," slightly reducing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with clear because/therefore linkages: Jenna's capture forces Maya to activate the contingency plan. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Maya escapes, ready to continue, with cost legible in alarms sounding and seeds of doubt planted. Orientation is solid within the first 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the auric lagoon and puddle reflections constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful, such as the lagoon's glow under starlight, and the environment actively shapes tactics like the light-based messages.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth vs. lies is signaled early, and escalation is driven by Maya's agency under the causal lens, culminating in the broadcast. Cost is visible in alarms and risk, but could be more visceral. One meaningful tightening occurs when plans unravel, forcing the reappearance action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and resistance emerges organically through events like the broadcast, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the lagoon containing memories, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, such as Maya's selective attention to puddle patterns. Voice is consistent and purposefully compressed, but absence of dialogue limits testing of subtext and character distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms. Minor issues include slight redundancy in "carefully resourceful," but no major artifacts or loops obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise of revised histories is transformed through specific details like puddle maps and the auric lagoon, creating a fresh synthesis. Risk-taking in the communication method heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
