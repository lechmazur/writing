<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elaran's defiant artist motive is clear and consistent, driving his exploration and poetry sessions. His internal conflict between curiosity and cost is embodied in key moments, like his shiver upon hearing the voice. The final choice to refract truth into verses is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the spire's destruction and his tempered readiness for confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the spire crumbling and Elaran descending to face consequences, under a causal lens where his poetry sessions lead directly to this outcome. Orientation is anchored early with the canyon and bone towers. Cost is legible in the spire's defeat and his transformed understanding, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting of bone towers and echo-canyon constrains choices by amplifying poetry and emotions, charging the final image of the spire crumbling. Sensory details like mist and echoes are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elaran's POV. The environment actively pressures the plot, making it indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elaran's agency under the causal lens, from poetry sessions to the voice's answer and his decision to refract truth. The dominant stake of truth vs. cost tightens meaningfully, with visible price in the spire's destruction and his altered stance. No coincidental resolutions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, such as the voice's whisper and Elaran's refraction, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on truth and forgiveness. Subtext operates in implications, like "forgiveness costs truth," without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material through the conceptual repricing of forgiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice reflecting Elaran's artist mindset. Perception is character-specific, like noting how the spire changes with poetry. No head-hopping; elision in poetry sessions is taught and pays off at closure. Rhythmic control under pressure supports the narrative.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise and vivid, with high information density advancing story and atmosphere. No significant loops or artifacts; figurative language like "mist clung like a shroud" is purposeful. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and closure clarity is unharmed by any line-level issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of artist using poetry to uncover truth in a forbidden setting feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific choices, like the echo-canyon's role. Risk-taking in the poetic method heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure integrates elements cohesively.</comment>
