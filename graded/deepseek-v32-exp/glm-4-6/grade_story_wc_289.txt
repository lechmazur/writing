<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. His final realization is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the flood of secrets. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; contradictions in his obsession are shown in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost on-page, as Elias reconfigures his role in the tapestry. Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, with the nest and installation driving causality. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and selective, filtered through Elias's POV. The nest and installation constrain choices and charge the final image, with setting integrated into action. No generic placeholder; environment pressures tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding the thread) escalates through accumulative density, driven by Elias's agency in following the nest and entering the installation. Cost is unmistakable in the flood of secrets, reweighting options under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of interconnectedness emerges organically from images and events, with subtext in the nest and installation. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the epiphany.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature. Voice controls rhythm under pressure, and purposeful compression (e.g., "prismatic quiet") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, especially in peak beats. Sentences advance story without redundancy or muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghostwriter trope with accumulative, lyrical structure feels inevitable. Risk-taking in non-causal escalation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details transform familiar material.</comment>
