<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to uncover the truth is clear and drives the narrative, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as the agonizing return from the parallel world. Interiority is concrete and character-specific, avoiding stock phrasing. The final change is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the weight of the revealed truth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—the agony of travel and the resonance of the truth—under a causal drive lens that holds throughout. The plot structure is tight, with a single POV and clear orientation early on. The redirect action causes the outcome, and the shard's spontaneity constrains tactics effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered through sensory details like "rust-eaten repair bay walls" and "metallic tang," and the spaceport and green glass shard constrain choices and charge the final image. The environment guides action and mirrors internal states, with coherent spatial choreography and purposeful detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled—discovering the truth—and escalate through Kael's agency, such as redirecting the data, under the causal lens. The cost is unmistakable in the agony of travel and emotional weight of the revelation, narrowing options and foreclosing paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth and self-discovery emerges organically from events, with subtext in the shard's role and the final image of being a "cartographer of his own soul." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though it leans slightly explicit in the closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with a poetic, sensory-driven perceptual signature and stable POV. The prose rhythm modulates with pressure, and elision is taught and paid off, as in the shard's spontaneous use. No head-hopping or register issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "chaotic symphony" is purposeful, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats, such as the world-dissolving transition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise of a sensory map maker weaving between worlds is fresh and well-integrated, with tropes transformed through specific details like the green glass shard. Turns feel earned, and risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
