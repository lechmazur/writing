<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with interiority like "luminous regret" adding depth, though some emotion edges toward diagnostic label-speak. Her actions under pressure, such as using the river stone to metamorphose the library, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final choice is earned by prior causality, but minor abstraction in peak emotions prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—the library's metamorphosis—under a causal lens, and cost is legible in Elara's "luminous regret" and ongoing vigilance. The orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity, though the resolution relies slightly on a late-breaking method.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting, like the "blooming library above clouds," is vividly integrated and constrains choices, such as the library's transformation charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, with the river stone acting as a micro-setting that shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens, from noticing unbound shadows to metamorphosing the library, with cost visible in her regret and the need for constant vigilance. The dominant stake of preserving hope tightens meaningfully, though the method of comparison feels slightly underutilized in peak beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as hope fragmenting into crystalline patterns, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the transformed library and Elara's renewed purpose, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and third-person limited to Elara, with a distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "shadows stretch like fingers." The voice is consistently poetic and controlled under pressure, though minor register drift in abstract terms like "luminous regret" occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm, but figurative language in high-pressure beats, such as "heart ache with luminous regret," risks mild overwriting without pattern payoff. Information density is high, and closure remains clear, though minor scaffold appears in repetitive emotional descriptors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise of shareable dreams and unbound shadows is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in poetic style and conceptual depth heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the transformation of the library is grounded in specific details.</comment>
