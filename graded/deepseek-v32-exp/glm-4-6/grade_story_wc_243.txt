<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in loss, with embodied emotion in micro-choices like tracing the locket. However, contradictory impulses (haunted euphoria) are summarized rather than acted out in scene, preventing the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost as Elias places the locket, completing the covenant. The causal lens holds tightly, and orientation is clear early, with the jetty's reconfiguration charging the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The blooming jetty constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like luminous flowers weaving atmosphere into action. Specificity is purposeful and integral to the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elias's agency in documenting proximate causes, leading to the locket's placement with cost. Under the causal lens, options narrow meaningfully, though the cost could be more visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and love transcending worlds emerges organically from events, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the locket's absorption. Subtext operates in silence and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, and perceptual signature is clear in Elias's selective attention. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Minor overwriting in phrases like "haunted euphoria" slightly reduces propulsion, but clarity remains.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The walnut-ink archivist and regenerated covenant offer a fresh synthesis, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in the quiet ending heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
