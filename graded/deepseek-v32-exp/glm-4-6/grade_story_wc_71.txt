<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his trait as a "creeping normality noticer," driving his actions from observation to sanctification. Interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., "the world fell silent... vibrated through his bones." The final choice to sanctify the house is earned by prior causality, though internal conflict is minimal, which is acceptable at this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds patterns through Elias's observations and actions, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds, but the cost, while conceptually present in the house's transformation, lacks a strongly felt personal price for Elias, slightly reducing impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (e.g., "violet fingerprint scent," "salt air") and the micro-setting (orris root shard, teacup) constrains choices and charges the final image. The bayside cottage and spring atmosphere are integrated into action, though the "quiet bay" element is more tonal than causal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding houses' aliveness) escalates through Elias's agency under the Accumulative lens, e.g., touching the shard intensifies the house's breathing. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt, limiting the stakes' urgency despite clear protagonist-driven escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as the "shard of hush" and displaced objects, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of house consciousness, reweighting prior material with purposeful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "creeping normality noticer's instinct") and rhythmic control. Voice remains consistent and poetic, filtering details through Elias's bias, and any elision (e.g., the shard's effect) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is elegant and dense, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language ("auditory gold," "hushed blaze") is purposeful and clear, though minor overwriting exists without harming closure. Information density is high, advancing story and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise of houses as living entities sanctified through displaced objects is fresh and specific, transforming familiar tropes through grounded details. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
