<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Technician's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative; his skillfully observant nature is embodied in actions like dust analysis, and the weightless burden motif adds depth without diagnostic speak. Micro-choices under pressure, such as engaging with the ghost, reveal hierarchy of values. Final renunciation of the ghost's unrest is earned through prior causality, with cost felt in the pocketed mainspring barrel.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from investigation to discovery; closure is a decisive change with cost legible when sorrow lifts and ghost dissipates. Orientation is anchored early in the abandoned ticket office. Persistent constraint of hidden ceilings shapes tactics, and the mainspring barrel's impact drives the resolution without coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices—dust patterns and ceiling cracks guide the technician's actions. The abandoned circus office charges the final image with bittersweet release. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding cliché; the mainspring barrel as a micro-setting object reweights closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering secrets escalates through agency—finding the dust swirl and engaging the ghost narrows options. Cost is unmistakable in the ghost's release and technician's burden. Under causal lens, pressure coheres and tightens with one meaningful turn, driven by protagonist's choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of hidden burdens and peace emerges through particulars like the mainspring barrel and cracks, not statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in weightless burden imagery, and the final image reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, observant voice reflects technician's profession and emotional state. No head-hopping; prose rhythm modulates with pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., ghost vision) is taught and paid off. Internal voice remains coherent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language ("dust lay like a shroud") is purposeful and coherent. Sentences advance story efficiently, and closure image is clear. No register drift or scaffold in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost-seeing technician and circus tragedy feels inevitable; premise offers fresh angle on familiar tropes through specific detail. Risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure integrates elements organically with emotional specificity.</comment>
