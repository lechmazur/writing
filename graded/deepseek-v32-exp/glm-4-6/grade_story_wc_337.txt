<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's profession as mask restorer deeply integrates with theme, and his internal conflict ("lucid unrest") is embodied under pressure. Final realization earned through causal progression, with micro-choices revealing value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieved with Elias's conceptual repricing of his work, cost legible in spirit release and understanding. Hybrid lens (causal-textural) holds steady from inciting incident to ending, with persistent constraint of knots shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary's fractured light actively charges the final image and constrains perception, with sensory details filtered through Elias's POV. Setting operates as micro-setting that alters tactics and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly with each unraveled knot, driven by Elias's agency under the hybrid lens; cost is tangible in the "accumulated silence" released and spirits grounded.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief versus masks emerges implicitly through action and image; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting Elias's purpose without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; lyrical prose remains character-consistent under pressure, with elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high density and rhythmic control without loops or artifacts; figurative language serves closure and propulsion, with no muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mask restoration and spirit release feels inevitable in hindsight; risk in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
