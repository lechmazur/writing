<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's face blindness and artistic drive are consistently embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., tracing wood grain, assembling lenses) revealing a hierarchy of values. His final realization—"he felt seen"—is earned by prior causality, with cost in raw hands and the library's loss. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hybrid drive lens (causal actions with accumulative texture) holds strong; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where Elias's art is reweighted, with cost legible in "his hands raw from scraping indentations." Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the coin mechanism aligns with established logic. Demolition pressure tightens causality without coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image: the tree trunk library's hollows guide Elias's actions, and the "hollowed heart" echoes in the sky reflection. Sensory details (dust, decaying paper) are selective and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is coherent, with the safe reveal impacting tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mirroring the sky before demolition—escalates under hybrid lens, driven by Elias's agency (e.g., adjusting prisms as "city’s distant rumble grew louder"). Cost is visible in physical strain and the library's destruction. One meaningful tightening (dawn deadline) forecloses options with felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: beauty in patterns over faces is reinforced through the sky mirroring, with subtext in light fractals. The ending offers a non-literal answer—"the heavens, trapped in wood and glass"—without moralizing. Epiphanies are earned through specific struggle, resisting abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "pattern, texture, and light were his language"). Voice modulates under pressure, maintaining poetic compression without head-hopping. Elision (e.g., scholar’s guild legacy) is taught and pays off in closure. No dialogue present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold issues; figurative language ("kaleidoscope of clouds") is coherent and purposeful. Minor overwriting in peaks is offset by clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of face blindness and sky mirroring feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric structure heightening stakes. Specific details (crystal lenses, coin indentations) avoid template plots. Transformation test passed: emotional arc is inseparable from premise. +0.2 for risk coherence.</comment>
