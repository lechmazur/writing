<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to defeat emotional numbness is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority like "numbness cracking like old ice." His final choice to vivify the brain is earned by prior causality, and the cost of solitude is felt. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as his calm versus the clone's emotion, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—Kael's victory and the clone's dissolution—under a causal lens, with cost legible in "the certainty that he was now alone with the truth." Orientation is clear early, and the brain as a persistent constraint shapes tactics. The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and the ending reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo and void create a vivid, pressurized setting that constrains choices, such as the pedestal strike, and charges the final image. Sensory details like "void swirling beneath his bare feet" are selective and purposeful, filtered through Kael's POV. The brain as a micro-setting object evolves in use, meeting the 9+ test by altering tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—custody of the brain for existential right—escalates through Kael's agency, from verbal sparring to physical and emotional confrontation. The vivification action narrows options and delivers cost with the clone's dissolution. Under the causal lens, pressure coheres and tightens, with the cost unmistakable on the page in Kael's solitude.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of identity and selfhood emerges implicitly through the clone battle and brain symbolism, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in Kael's wonder if he "defeated the numbness or just gave it a new name." Subtext operates in gesture and image, and the conceptual repricing charges prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice evident in phrases like "history was rewriting itself." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in exchanges like "You feel nothing"/"And you feel too much." Perceptual signature is consistent, though minor register drift occurs, but elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "numbness a cold blanket" is purposeful and clear. Sentence-level propulsion is strong, though a slight overwriting tendency exists in peak beats, but it doesn't harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes clone custody and ego death survival with originality, transforming tropes through specific details like the labeled "duplicate" brain. Emotional truth and risk-taking heighten stakes, and the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. The concept is fully integrated, with bold choices that cohere without gimmickry.</comment>
