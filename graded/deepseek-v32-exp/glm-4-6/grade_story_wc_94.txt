<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Poet's motivation is clear and drives the narrative; contradictory impulses like "furiously tranquil" are embodied and earned in the closure, with micro-choices under pressure revealing hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change and cost under a hybrid causal-accumulative lens; orientation is early and clear, with the timer and envelope driving a legible shift from witness to cartographer.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the observatory and storm constraining reflection and charging the final image; sensory details like "clouds churned like ink" are purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through poet's agency in opening the envelope; cost is unmistakable in the "wound reopening" and transformed burden, narrowing options under the hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from scars and mapping; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the cartographer metaphor without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent with poetic diction; perceptual signature is clear in phrases like "cartography of scars," and POV stability supports the accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high density and rhythmic control; no loops or scaffold issues, with figurative language like "storm-kissed wonder" serving narrative momentum without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of censorship and cartography feels inevitable; specific details like the bus timetable and darkroom timer heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
