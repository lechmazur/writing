<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices. His final realization about grief is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the closure. However, slight over-articulation in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under the accumulative/textural lens, felt cost legible in the final image. The structure builds through patterned imagery, and orientation is clear early. No causality breaks, but minor ambiguity in lens persistence holds it back from perfection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the greenhouse and butterflies constraining choices and charging the final image. Details are filtered through POV, integrating action and theme seamlessly. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in Elias's carving and realization. Stakes around collective grief tighten meaningfully, though the pace is gradual, fitting the lens but limiting peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer on grief as a current. Subtext in symbols like butterflies and ribbon avoids moralizing, but minor abstraction in the closure slightly reduces impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature. Rhythm and diction reflect Elias's mind under pressure, and elision (e.g., spectral cues) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, though minor overwriting in descriptive passages prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable, with risk-taking in accumulative structure heightening stakes. The concept of spectral mentorship and grief as migration is fresh and grounded in character, avoiding cliché.</comment>
