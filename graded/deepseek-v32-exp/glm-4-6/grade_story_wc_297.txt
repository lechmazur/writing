<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's "anxious elation" is embodied and contradictory, driving micro-choices like pressing his scar to the bark; his final purposeful stance is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the scar linking.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (silver light piercing the eclipse) and felt cost (scar linking); causal lens holds tightly from inciting incident to resolution, with orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt glade and ancient oak constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details like "ozone and wet earth" are selective and purposeful, woven through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the causal lens, from tracing the clipping to linking scars; cost is legible in the searing flash and realigned covenant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reconciliation emerges through events and images (e.g., figures mirroring each other); ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; poetic diction and rhythmic control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity, e.g., "unraveled and woven through the tree's ancient wounds."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied syntax with no loops or artifacts; figurative language like "a river of memory" is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of eclipsed covenant and scar-linking mechanics feels inevitable; risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming familiar tropes.</comment>
