<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and drives the plot, with embodied emotion like trembling hands. However, some interiority is summarized rather than shown in scene, such as his bitterness, slightly reducing immediacy. The final change is earned through causal actions, and flaws complicate choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Kael subsumes remorse and returns changed, under a causal lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the pavilion's discovery tightens options. Cost is legible in the final image of general ache replacing specific pains.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like rain-slickened stones and bioluminescent darkness. The tidal pools and pavilion constrain choices and charge the final image, mirroring Kael's internal state. Economy and POV filter are strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start, and escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the causal lens, culminating in the subsumption action. Cost is unmistakable in the trade-off of specific pain for general sorrow. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the fortress's brittleness and the pavilion's remorse, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Kael's transformation. Subtext operates in implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic voice that reflects Kael's perception. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, as in dream sequences. Rhythm controls pressure, though minor register consistency holds it back from highest band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no major artifacts or loops. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though slight overwriting in descriptive passages prevents a perfect score. Closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of fantasy and emotional depth, with specific details like the coral pavilion and tidal pool method. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
