<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to carve from grief is clear and intensifies through the scene, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation in earned stasis is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the transformation of loss into art. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; interiority is concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (earned stasis) where the completed carving crystallizes peace from grief. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and cost is legible in the final image: "love transforms but does not end." The persistent constraint of grief shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated, with the rain-beaded skylight and loft filtering light that charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, reflecting Elara's POV; the carving tool and wood grain constrain choices and deepen the theme. Environment subtly mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming grief is signaled early and escalates through Elara's agency in carving, under the accumulative lens. A meaningful deepening occurs as the carving nears completion, foreclosing the path of pure sorrow with visible cost: "heart to heal around its hollows." Pressure coheres and tightens without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief and transformation emerges through particulars like the carving and skylight imagery, not direct statement. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete experience, avoiding platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in Elara's poetic, grief-filtered observations. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and syntax reflects her state without head-hopping. No dialogue present, but internal voice is coherent and specific under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; metaphors like "crystallized time" are consistent and purposeful. Minor overwriting in peaks (e.g., "herbarium of moments") but clarity and propulsion remain intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of widowhood, carving, and lion taming feels inevitable, with specific details grounding the premise. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core concept is transformed through character and world, avoiding template plots.</comment>
