<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dealer's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The shift from professional detachment to unexpected empathy is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the final decision. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, such as the war between thoroughness and genuine care.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the dealer amplifies hope instead of subsume grief, under a causal lens that holds throughout. Cost is legible on-page in the dealer's felt grief and transformed motivation. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of their profession shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The amber grotto and blotter petal function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image with warmth. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the dealer's POV. The static electricity and light evolve consistently with the transformation, mirroring internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, with the dealer's sensing of the chemist's determination leading to a key turning point. Cost is unmistakable in the grief absorbed and the shift in methodology. The dominant stake of internal conflict between detachment and empathy tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, with half-truths evolving into seeds of truth without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the grotto as a sanctuary. Subtext operates in implication, such as the blotter petal's reweighted meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in the dealer's poetic, observational voice. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and purposeful elision (e.g., the chemist's off-page presence) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and rhythm. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, without loops or scaffold that obscure causality. Read-aloud flow is smooth, and peak beats maintain clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes emotion dealing with static electricity in a fresh, non-obvious way that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details like the blotter petal and transformation are integral to the narrative arc.</comment>
