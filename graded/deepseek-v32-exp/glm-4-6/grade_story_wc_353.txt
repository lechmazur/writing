<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Eliara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. However, interior contradiction is minimal, and the resolution, while earned, lacks complex conflicting impulses in scene. The final choice is credible but does not fully showcase hierarchical values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the sculpture's song fading but leaving the grove resonant. Cost is legible in the transience ("the last note hung in the air... dissolving"), and orientation is clear early. The drive lens holds without contradiction, and the persistent constraint of silence shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory specificity, and the porcelain insulator as a micro-setting object constrains choice and charges the final image. The grove's atmosphere coheres with the tone, and details are filtered through Eliara's POV, though spatial choreography is minimal but sufficient for scope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (creating music) is signaled early and escalates through Eliara's strumming agency under the Accumulative lens, leading to a meaningful deepening. Cost is felt in the song's fleeting nature, narrowing options, but the escalation lacks multiple beats of pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of empathy and revival emerges through concrete actions and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the sculpture's song and the grove's renewed possibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and lyrical voice that modulates with emotional intensity. Elision is purposeful, and prose rhythm supports pressure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density, varied syntax, and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, and peak beats maintain clarity despite rich diction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and well-integrated, with originality in the tree-song sculptor and empathy in motion. The synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
