<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in spiritual curiosity, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as using the breathing method and Kwan yin's tear. The final healing action is earned by prior causality, though interior contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing via the final image of luminous webs, reweighting the premise with cost under the accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight from memory to healing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the viaduct and camera obscura constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like wisteria and metallic tang are filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the accumulative lens, using breathing and the tear to reveal sparks, with cost legible in the release of unused love. Stakes are consistently high and interwoven with theme.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of healing and interconnectedness emerges through concrete images like sparks and the vial, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and implications.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that remains coherent under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in the closure.</comment>
