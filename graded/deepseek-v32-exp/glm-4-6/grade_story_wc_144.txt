<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His blindness and artistry are integrated into his actions, though internal conflict is minimal, which slightly limits depth. The final choice to restore the drone is earned through causal steps, with cost felt in his satisfaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is achieved on-page with the drone's flight, a decisive change under a causal lens, and cost is legible in Elias's smile and the resolved hum. Orientation is clear early, and the structure is tight with one continuous scene. The ship's deadline adds pressure without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mist-coated rail depot and workshop are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail, constraining choices through the fountain's refraction and mist. The setting charges the final image by sharpening focus and influencing navigation, fulfilling the 9+ test with purposeful integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early with the drone's repair and ship's deadline, escalating through Elias's agency under the causal lens. Cost is visible in his effort and the time pressure, leading to a meaningful tightening that forecloses other options and restores purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through restoration and perception beyond sight, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the drone's flight, reweighting prior material through imagery and subtext, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, filtered through Elias's blindness and expertise. Voice is consistent and rhythmic under pressure, with purposeful elision (e.g., refraction methods) taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful, with clear propulsion in peak beats. No scaffold or coherence issues detract from closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The concept of a blind artisan using refraction to repair a drone is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in perspective and method heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure integrates elements organically.</comment>
