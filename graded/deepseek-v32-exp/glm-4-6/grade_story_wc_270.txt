<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maeva's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final choice to unseal the embryo is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction is minimal, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change and felt cost as new species sprout, under a causal lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the plot's because/therefore linkages are tight, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the volcanic hot springs constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are integrated through Maeva's POV, and the environment actively shapes the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Maeva's agency under the causal lens, culminating in the unsealing with legible cost. The conflict between tradition and evolution tightens meaningfully, foreclosing options with visible consequences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to evolving tradition. Subtext in the plants' whispers and kite script avoids moralizing, with complexity that lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and stable in single POV, with poetic rhythm that heightens pressure without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent, though slightly ornate at times.</comment>
