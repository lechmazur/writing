<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with embodied emotions like trembling hands. However, internal conflict is minimal, lacking contradictory impulses in scene, which prevents a higher score. The final endurance is earned but without deep struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a conceptual repricing as Elian understands trees absorb emotions, reconfiguring their approach to maintenance with cost legible in "hands trembling slightly." The causal lens holds tightly from discovery to revelation, and orientation is anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, from the labyrinth corridors to the stormlit tower, with sensory details like "rain lashed" filtering through Elian's POV. The sextant and trees constrain choices and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes around discovering what trees witness escalate through Elian's agency in using the sextant and mapping dreams, culminating in a breakthrough with cost in the stormlit tower. Under the causal lens, pressure tightens meaningfully, though the pin heard moment is slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, exploring invisible histories through images like golden threads and trees converting sorrow into growth. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic with stable POV, reflecting Elian's perceptual signature in tools and emotions. No head-hopping, but some abstract phrasing like "quantified sorrow" slightly distances immediacy under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with high information density and varied rhythm, such as "lightning intermittently illuminated," advancing story without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, supporting clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes quantified sorrow and tree witnessing with originality, feeling inevitable through specific details like dream mapping. Risk-taking in conceptual repricing heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure is fully integrated.</comment>
