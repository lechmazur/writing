<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The keeper's motivation to observe change is consistent and rooted in trait, but lacks internal conflict or micro-choices under pressure; passive observation dominates, with no earned change or endurance with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as the keeper gains understanding of nature's paradoxical mechanisms, cost legible in the acceptance of impermanence; accumulative lens holds with coherent transitions via the origami swan.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory-rich settings like the overgrown library and obsidian refuge constrain choice and charge the final image; the refuge's reflective surfaces shape perception and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation occurs through deepening understanding of change, but agency is passive observation; cost is conceptual rather than driven by protagonist action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence emerges organically through images like decay and silence; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though some abstraction lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision in transitions is taught and paid off, though dense phrasing may slightly obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush and rhythmic with high information density, but some overwriting and repetitive phrases like "regenerative silence" create minor artifacts without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements like the origami swan as dimension-key and chronicle keeper in a decaying library feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
