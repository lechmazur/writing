<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Aelia's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. However, the characterization lacks deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, preventing a higher score. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, but the emotional arc remains somewhat linear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Aelia realizes paths are deliberately removed, reweighting the premise with undeniable cost in the bittersweet sensation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with patterns of emotions and voids escalating to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early, and causality remains intact throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The iridescent geode cave and crater glass are vividly described with selective sensory detail, charging the final image and constraining choice through their properties. However, the setting does not fully pressure tactics or alter options beyond atmosphere, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled and escalate through Aelia's agency with the seeds and glass, leading to a discovery that forecloses options. Cost is legible in the unresolved questions and bittersweet tone. Under the Accumulative lens, density increase reweights the stake, though the escalation is more incremental than transformative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the exploration of memory and loss, with the empty seeds offering a resonant, non-literal answer to why paths disappear. Subtext operates through implication and image, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice that modulates with emotional intensity. Perception is character-specific, and elision is purposeful. Minor register consistency in peak beats prevents a higher score, but no head-hopping or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with varied rhythm and high information density, advancing story momentum. Minor overwriting in figurative language occurs but does not obscure clarity or closure. No significant loops or artifacts harm cause-effect logic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of sea-foam recollectionist, crater glass, and emotional seeds is highly original and organic, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in world-building heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
