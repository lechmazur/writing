<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eloise's motivation is clear and personal, driving the narrative with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her internal conflict and the relationship with Alistair are dramatized, leading to an earned renunciation with visible cost. The final choice feels inevitable based on prior causality, though Alistair's ghostly presence limits on-page interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Alistair's spirit finds peace, under a causal drive lens that holds throughout. The cost is legible in the transformation and apology, and orientation is clear early. The structure is tight with one meaningful tightening, and the ending reconfigures options without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail, and the perfume bottle constrains choice and charges the final image. The archive's atmosphere supports tone, and spatial choreography is coherent. Micro-setting elements like the device integrate into action, reflecting POV priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (apology) is signaled early and escalates through Eloise's agency under the causal lens, with a meaningful tightening as she uses the device. Cost is felt in the emotional resolution, and the climax forecloses options with visible price. No coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect miracles emerges through events and images without direct statement, offering a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext operates in dialogue and gesture, and the concept integrates with character struggle, avoiding moralizing or tidy resolutions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature ("gravel and starlight"). Voice modulates with pressure, and dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure with rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts or loops. Sentences advance story and atmosphere, and figurative language is coherent. No scaffold or register drift; clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of gossip-column exorcist and spiritual apology, transforming tropes through specific details. The premise feels organic and inevitable, with risk-taking in method and tone that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
