<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to cultivate serenity is clear and consistent, driving her actions throughout. Her olfactory sensitivity is embodied and shapes key choices, such as detecting the corpse flower's scent. The relationship with Finn applies pressure and deepens her arc, and her final realization is earned through prior causality with visible cost in the wilt and seed distribution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Elara understands the wisdom was in the process, not the bloom, with cost felt in the flower's wilt and community growth. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with the seven-month progression tightening stakes. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of time shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The treetop village is vividly anchored and constrains choices, such as the porch overseeing the canopy. Olfactory details are purposeful and POV-filtered, with the corpse flower charging the final image. Sensory selection reflects Elara's priorities, and the setting evolves with the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake in cultivating serenity escalates through the flower's growth and community involvement, driven by Elara's agency. Cost is legible in the bloom's decay and seed sharing, narrowing options under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening occurs as the bud forms and reconfigures her understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of embracing decay for rebirth emerges organically from events like the flower's life cycle and journaling. Subtext operates in gestures and images, with no moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the realization about process and community.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Elara's olfactory-focused narration. Voice is poetic yet controlled, and dialogue with Finn feels natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variation and high information density without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language, like "suspended between worlds like a spider's web," is consistent and purposeful. Sentence propulsion aligns with scene needs, and closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of herbalist, corpse flower, and treetop village feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the wrapping paper journaling. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative narrative heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
