<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's face blindness and methodical nature are consistently embodied, driving his ritualistic work; motivation to awaken empathy is clear and intensifies, with final renunciation earned through prior causality. However, contradictory impulses are more implied than dramatized in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the mist thins, acknowledging Lena's story; accumulative/textural lens holds tightly, with face blindness as a persistent constraint shaping the final image; cost is legible in Elias carrying the weight of forgotten sorrow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Quarry and mist create a vivid, atmospheric setting that charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, with the ribbon fragment acting as a micro-setting that constrains Elias's choices. No ornamental description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (awakening empathy) escalate through Elias's agency in unifying opposites during the drawing process; cost is unmistakable in the emotional weight he carries, foreclosing paths under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of empathy and memory emerges organically through images like the portrait and mist; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the conceptual repricing of absence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is character-specific, and rhythmic control under pressure is evident, e.g., in the description of the quarry's "furrowed hush." No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "stone lips" is coherent and purposeful, enhancing clarity and propulsion in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise of a face-blind artist solving cold cases is fresh and specific; synthesis of opposites feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the lyrical method heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
