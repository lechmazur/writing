<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation to unbind grief and find beauty is clear and consistently driven by her acoustically perceptive nature. Her micro-choices, like kneeling to hum and play, reveal embodied emotion and values under pressure. The final decision to become the next note is earned by prior actions, foreclosing despair with visible cost in the sapling's renewal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens, with Lyra transforming the hush by integrating into it. Cost is legible in the sapling trembling and her steady heart, and the lens holds without ambiguity. Orientation is clear within 120 words, anchoring the post-apocalyptic setting and stakes early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse and shipwrecks are vividly specific, with sensory details like damp wood and groaning frames filtering through Lyra's POV. The setting constrains choices (e.g., bowl on damp floor) and charges the final image with the dome's light and sapling's unfurling, essential to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is driven by Lyra's agency—playing until fingers bleed, using the bowl, humming, and speaking—which deepens the stake of overcoming grief. Cost is unmistakable in her tear and the bowl's vibrations, reweighing options toward renewal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the bowl's echoes and sapling's growth, offering a non-literal answer to loss through beauty in the unfinished. Subtext operates in gesture and image, avoiding moralizing; the ending reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, acoustically focused prose that reflects Lyra's inner state. Rhythm and diction control under pressure, such as the bowl "waking," enhance emotional beats without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety, with figurative language like "chronic hush" serving purpose without muddle. No loops or scaffold issues; sentences advance story and atmosphere cohesively, especially in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing post-apocalyptic silence with music and memory, transformed through specific details like the mendicant's bowl and shipwrecks. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable from prior particulars.</comment>
