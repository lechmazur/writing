<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Arthur reconfigures his understanding of endings, with cost legible in his shock.

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with sensory details like "air tasted of salt, sorrow" that pressure choices and charge the final image.
