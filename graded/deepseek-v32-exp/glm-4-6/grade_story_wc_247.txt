<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Julian and Lyra exhibit concrete interiority with embodied emotions, such as "bittersweet joy" and tears. Their motivations are clear and intensify under pressure, driving the shared purpose. The final choice to complete their performance is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in their solitude.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure is a Charged Poise with legible cost ("tears prick his eyes"). Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the filmless camera shapes tactics. The ending reconfigures meaning without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The harbor setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "ripple a faint seam of silver." The camera functions as a micro-setting, altering tactics. Specificity is purposeful and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of remembering forgotten voices escalates through agency—framing, signing, clicking—under the Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable in the "sorrow of their solitude." One meaningful tightening forecloses options with felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and art emerges through events and images, not statement; subtext operates in gestures and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV (Julian's) is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic yet precise, and elision (e.g., camera without film) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("luminous sorrow") is coherent and supports pressure. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept of mapping silence with sign language and a filmless camera is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Emotional truth and risk-taking heighten stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
