<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to compile fragments is clear and drives her choices; her reactively visionary trait is embodied in actions like arranging empty shelves and using staggered intervals. Micro-choices under pressure, such as sharing fragments gently, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final endurance in acknowledging absences is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the exhibit gives shape to absences with felt cost on page ("absences could never be fully navigated, only acknowledged"). Orientation is clear by ~120 words with mist-shrouded docks and ivory harbor. Pattern of fragments taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivory harbor after rain is vivid and selective, filtering through Elara's perception; it charges the final image with harbor lights reflecting on rain-washed buildings. The herald's trumpet valve acts as micro-setting, constraining choices and reweighting meaning at closure. Sensory details are purposeful and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of compiling fragments escalates through Elara's agency under accumulative lens; cost is legible in the community's gradual recognition and the final exhibit's acknowledgment of loss. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kai's identification triggers a wave of contributions, narrowing options and deepening understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of navigated absences emerges through particulars like the trumpet valve and fragmented stories, not direct statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the exhibit giving shape to formlessness. Subtext operates in gaps and silences, avoiding moralizing while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; Elara's voice is lyrical yet controlled, reflecting her archival focus. Purposeful compression in fragments and staggered intervals is taught and pays off. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control; sentences advance story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "sunlight breaking through clouds" is purposeful and coherent. No artifacts obscure causality or closure; read-aloud ear test passes with varied syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concept of navigated absences and reactively visionary approach synthesizes fresh, non-obvious angle on exile and memory; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test: story would fail with different elements due to specificity and closure linkage.</comment>
