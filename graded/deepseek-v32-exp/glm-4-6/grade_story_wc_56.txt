<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation shifts credibly from legend-seeking to understanding lies, with embodied interiority like "he felt more like a legend’s undertaker." The final renunciation of his life's work is earned with visible cost in "To let it go was a kind of death," and contradictory impulses act in scene during the salvage.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual repricing as Elias recontextualizes the legend into a "blueprint for a dream," with cost legible in the serene upheaval. Causal lens holds tight from sundial use to discovery, and orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice through the canal's current and silt, charging the final image with lessons. Sensory details like "cold water" and "moss-covered pylons" are POV-filtered and purposeful, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the causal lens, from doubting the legend to actively salvaging the chest. Cost is unmistakable in the trade-off of his life's work for clarity, tightening stakes meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the discovery, offering a resonant, non-literal answer in the final line about "blueprints for the bridges we wish we could cross." No moralizing; subtext deepens through the engineer's failed dream.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in lyrical phrases like "errant legend seeker." Voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., legend details) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts. Sentences like "The pre-dawn stillness... was a physical weight" advance story and atmosphere without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes treasure hunt and philosophical insight, transforming tropes through specific details like the sundial and schematics. Risk-taking in the quiet climax pays off with inevitability.</comment>
