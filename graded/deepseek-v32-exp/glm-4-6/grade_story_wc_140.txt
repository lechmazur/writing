<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing the poison label. The final choice to keep it as a "key" is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the collage of faces image. The accumulative/textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early, with the setting and stakes anchored within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and POV-filtered, with the container labyrinth constraining movement and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, reflecting the character's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with layering stories increasing density and reweighting stakes. Cost is unmistakable in the final realization, though external conflict is minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of erased histories emerges through events and images, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the poison label metaphor. Subtext operates in implication without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature that filters reality poetically. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity and propulsion in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of existential quest and bureaucratic error, transformed through specific details. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
