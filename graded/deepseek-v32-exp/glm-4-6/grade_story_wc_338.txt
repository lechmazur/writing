<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot with embodied interiority, but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure. His final choice is earned by prior causality, though the emotional cost is somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change and conceptual cost under a hybrid causal-accumulative lens; orientation is early and clear, with causality intact from journal discovery to ritual completion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details in the fresco vault and henge create atmosphere, and the setting constrains choice by hosting the ritual, charging the final image with thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elias's agency in comparing videos and performing the ritual, narrowing options with a felt cost in the realization that reopening is only the beginning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence and empathy emerges organically through concrete actions and the final image, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, though the voice occasionally leans toward overwrought description without dialogue to test naturalism.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes map framing, acoustic anomalies, and empathy into a fresh, inevitable whole with risk-taking in method and closure that heightens stakes.</comment>
