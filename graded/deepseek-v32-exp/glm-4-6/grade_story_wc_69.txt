<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority like "expectant resignation" and micro-choices under pressure, such as using the rosette to teach. Her final endurance is earned, though minor idealization prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost—students achieving harmony and Eleanor's reflection on fading arts. The accumulative lens holds, causality is intact, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the library and rosette constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Eleanor's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes in preserving music and unity escalate through Eleanor's agency in rehearsals, leading to a meaningful tightening with cost on-page. Under the accumulative lens, density increases effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of harmony and diversity emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in music and gestures. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, consistent perceptual signature, and natural dialogue. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and variety, with high information density and no major artifacts. Minor overwriting in dense phrasing prevents a higher score, but clarity is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of vanishing arts and unity through music, with specific details like the rosette. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
