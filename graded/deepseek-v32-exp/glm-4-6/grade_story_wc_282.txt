<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, driving key choices like heat-mapping and engaging with fossils. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices revealing her values. The transformation to conduit is earned through causal events, though contradictory impulses are underdeveloped, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (new responsibility as conduit), under a coherent Causal lens. Orientation is sharp early, and structure is tight with one continuous scene. Persistent constraints (fossils, gift) shape tactics, but cost could be more visceral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and POV-filtered, with the cave network and fossils constraining choices and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear, and details are integrated into action. The elm leaf fossil and shell function as micro-settings that alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (becoming a voice for the unknown) escalates under Causal lens through protagonist agency (heat-mapping triggering visions). Cost is legible in the emotional shift and newfound burden, but it is more conceptual than felt, limiting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with transitional objects as bridges offering a non-literal answer to silence and loss. Subtext operates through visions and realizations, avoiding moralizing. The final image reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and lyrical rhythm that modulates under pressure. Voice is consistent and character-specific, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping. Elision (e.g., mystical glow) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density, varied rhythm, and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats. Sentence-level craft supports momentum and closure effect flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of sensory mapping, transitional objects, and post-human world, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Specific details (elm leaf fossil) and emotional truth elevate it beyond template plots. Risk-taking in mystical elements coheres without gimmickry.</comment>
