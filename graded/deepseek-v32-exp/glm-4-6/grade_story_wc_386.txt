<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to salvage purity from wreckage is clear and consistent, driving her choices under pressure. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion shown in micro-choices like meditating with the snow globe. The final action—exposing the truth—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her exhaustion. However, minor diagnostic label-speak ("her gift—whispering to ghosts") slightly reduces the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the exposure of truth and a spirit finding peace, under a causal lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible in Elara's exhaustion. The persistent constraint of her ability shapes tactics, and the ending reconfigures options with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the glacial shrine and melted snow globe constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, reflecting POV bias. The environment pressures Elara's decisions and supports the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens, from analyzing dreams to weaving truth into consciousness. The dominant stake of exposing negligence tightens through her choices, with cost legible in her exhaustion. However, the resolution relies slightly on off-stage investigation, limiting the peak score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the snow globe and wreckage, offering a resonant answer to redemption without moralizing. Subtext operates in images and implications, but the final paragraph has a minor thematic echo ("salvage something pure") that slightly reduces freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Elara's worldview. Voice modulates under pressure, and elision (e.g., dream mechanics) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; dialogue, though minimal, is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, supporting momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes ghost whispering and glacial diving with originality, transformed through specific details like the melted snow globe. Emotional truth is specific, and risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without gimmickry. The integration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
