<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to preserve the lost song is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His final act of sending the pigeon is earned by prior causality, showcasing internal conflict and a credible change with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elian feels trust in his method, with cost legible in the final image. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, and orientation is clear early, with the attic and skylight anchoring the scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The attic setting is vividly rendered with sensory detail, constraining choices (e.g., dust mapping and pigeon sending) and charging the final image. Specificity is POV-filtered and purposeful, enhancing atmosphere without generic placeholder elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elian's agency under the accumulative lens, with a meaningful tightening as he sends the pigeon, carrying a visible emotional cost. The dominant stake of preservation and trust is signaled early and coheres through the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preservation and trust emerges through concrete images and actions, not direct statement, with subtext in the meteorite chip and dust motes. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping, enhancing the narrative's texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, with varied syntax and rhythm that support the accumulative drive without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of pigeon training, meteorite chip, and dust mapping is fresh and specific, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without gimmickry, supported by emotional truth.</comment>
