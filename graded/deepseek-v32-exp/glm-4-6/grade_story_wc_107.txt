<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Finn's motivation is clear and rooted in his contemplative nature, driving his decision to abandon the vase for the teardrop. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion shown through actions like tracing the bookmark. The final choice is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in foreclosing the original project. However, minor over-articulation in self-narration slightly reduces immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the teardrop piece symbolizes the thawing heart. Orientation is clear early, and the shift is motivated by ice imagery. Cost is legible in the embedding of the bookmark, altering the story's meaning. Persistent constraint of the bookmark shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the abandoned control room and ice melting season creating a cohesive atmosphere. Sensory details like "icicles wept" are purposeful and filtered through Finn's POV. The bookmark as a micro-setting object constrains choice by being pressed into the glass, charging the final image with thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Finn's internal conflict between plan and inspiration, escalating through his agency to abandon the vase. Under accumulative lens, deepening occurs via thematic density, with cost visible in the new piece capturing "freezing and the thaw." One meaningful tightening forecloses options and reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of the thawing heart emerges organically through images and actions, not statement, with subtext in the glassblowing process. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the teardrop, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Specific particulars like the bookmark's embedding avoid abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—Finn's poetic, contemplative voice controls rhythm and diction. Narration to empty dials is voice-motivated and consistent. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure. Minor theatricality in self-dialogue fits character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with purposeful compression in peaks. No major loops or scaffold issues, but slight overwriting in phrases like "weighty lightness" causes minor figurative strain. Propulsion remains clear, and closure image is undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of glassblowing, abandoned setting, and thawing heart concept feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightening stakes. Specific details like the bookmark's role transform tropes through grounded choices. Emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
