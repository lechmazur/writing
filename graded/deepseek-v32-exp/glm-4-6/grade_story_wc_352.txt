<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's prism-mind ability is consistently rendered and motivates her quest, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final integration of seeds is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction is minimal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal drive holds strong with clear because/therefore linkages; closure lands as a decisive change with cost legible in her expanded consciousness and responsibility. Gravity inversion as a constraint shapes tactics effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (e.g., mist-coiled grotto, breathing walls) pressure choices and charge the final image; the grotto and crystals constrain action and deepen atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency under the causal lens, from decoding to retrieval, with cost visible in her new duty to protect the seeds; one meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of hidden knowledge and balance emerges organically from events and images; the ending reweights prior material without moralizing, offering resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "prism-mind refracting"); voice is poetic yet controlled, and elision (e.g., gravity inversion mechanics) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm and no loops; figurative language ("latent blaze") enhances clarity without muddle, though minor overwriting exists in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tropes (e.g., prism-mind, seeds as literal entities) feels inevitable; risk-taking in conceptual elements heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
