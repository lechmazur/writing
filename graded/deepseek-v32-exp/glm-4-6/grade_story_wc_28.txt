<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is deeply embodied with clear, consistent motives as a "gentle radical." Her internal conflict—soft yet unyielding—drives micro-choices like renaming the stone, and her retrocognitive trap grounds the action in palpable cost. The final renaming feels earned by prior causality, with no diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost: the world shifts after she renames the stone, altering the plaza's atmosphere. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, and orientation is clear within 120 words. Persistent constraint of her retrocognitive trap shapes tactics, and the cost is legible in the shadows lengthening and receding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—"shattered sky," "skeletal walls"—and constrains choices: the tessera and plaza charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's POV. The environment actively pressures her renaming project, avoiding postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (hope vs. decay) escalate under the accumulative lens through Elara's agency—her renaming acts deepen the thematic weight. Cost is unmistakable in the world's shift and her embodied pain. One meaningful tightening (the tessera's placement) forecloses despair and reweights options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Elara's actions—renaming as "aberrant mercy"—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the transformed plaza, reweighting prior decay into hope. Subtext operates in gestures and imagery, resisting tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature that reflects Elara's inner state. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and any elision (e.g., retrocognitive memories) is taught and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats. Sentences advance story and atmosphere concisely, with no artifacts obscuring causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The concept of renaming ruins for hope is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of post-apocalyptic tropes. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry. Elements feel organic and inevitable in hindsight, with specificity anchoring universals.</comment>
