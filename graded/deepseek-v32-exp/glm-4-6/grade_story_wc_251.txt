<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arthur's motivation is clear and rooted in his ability to hear unspoken words, driving his rebellion with consistent traits. Interiority is concrete, such as his adjustment of glasses and cradling of ideas, though internal conflict could be more dramatized in scene. Micro-choices under pressure, like organizing the displays, reveal his values, and the final hope is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with Arthur's actions leading to the displays' activation, and closure lands as a Charged Poise where the town's shift in consciousness reconfigures stakes with felt cost. Mosaic structure with shards (library, grotto, meetings) is taught early and transitions legibly. Orientation is anchored within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of his ability shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the magnetic grotto and cobalt library filtering through Arthur's POV and constraining choices by amplifying his ability. Sensory details like starlight and mist are selective and integrated into action, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve with the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of shifting town consciousness is signaled early and escalates through Arthur's agency in organizing the displays, under the causal lens. One meaningful tightening occurs as the displays activate, foreclosing passive acceptance with cost legible in the risk and effort. Resolution is earned by his actions, though cost could be more visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of quiet rebellion emerges through events and images like chess puzzles and forests of second thoughts, without direct statement. Subtext operates in unspoken words and mirrored reflections, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the displays' invitation to wonder. Emotional aftereffect lingers with purposeful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Arthur, with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, selective noticing. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and elision (e.g., grotto's properties) is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present, and rhythmic control under pressure supports clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "mist curling like hesitant fingers" is consistent and purposeful, though slightly dense in peaks. Sentence-level propulsion is strong, and grammar is clean, with no artifacts harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes telepathic ability with intellectual rebellion in a fresh, non-obvious way, transformed through specific details like the magnetic grotto and window displays. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, and risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry. The ending feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
