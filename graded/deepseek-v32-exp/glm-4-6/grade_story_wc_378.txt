<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>L-734's fragmented interiority and embodied reactions under magnetic stress are vividly rendered, with the final choice to integrate fears feeling earned through escalating static and withering roses; minor abstract phrasing in peak beats slightly limits higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The causal chain from magnetic shift to controlled burn is tightly woven, and closure delivers a decisive change with cost legible in the transformed seed and survived roses, under a consistent causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glass dome and organic blossoms create a pressurized environment that constrains L-734's choices and charges the final image, with sensory details selectively enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate coherently from internal dissonance to external crisis, driven by L-734's agency in miniaturizing and burning the fear, with cost unmistakable in the integration sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Themes of containment and transformation emerge organically from events, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer with the fear-seed image, avoiding moralizing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of android caretaker, childhood fears, and magnetic chaos feels inventive and inevitable, with risk-taking in structure and theme heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
