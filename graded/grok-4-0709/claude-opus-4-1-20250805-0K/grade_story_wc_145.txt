<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Margot's dry wit and subtle confidence drive concrete micro-choices, like overlaying the condensation pattern, revealing internal contradictions between caution and obsession; the final decision to share the phrasebook earns a resonant endurance with felt risk, though the inspector's motivation feels slightly underdeveloped as secondary pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, patterns like dog-eared pages and condensation build to a Charged Poise closure where sharing reconfigures trust with conceptual cost ("risk everything"); orientation anchors early via falcon and outpost, but minor ellipsis in the polyglot's backstory slightly softens causality without breaking lens hold.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The frozen lake and rusted outpost constrain choices, with pressure ridges and condensation mirroring the watershed to charge the final image of thawing tranquility; sensory details like frost patterns and groaning wind are POV-filtered and purposeful, evolving causally to support revelation without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering river sources tightens through pattern accumulation, deepening knowledge and forcing the trust decision with visible risk; under Textural lens, cadence shift at the inspector's arrival reweights options, though coincidence of their approach slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of buried emergence and convergence emerges organically from images like rivulets and upwelling words, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final thaw breath without moralizing; subtext in falcon's herald and phrasebook adds complexity, inviting reflection on patience and risk.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stays stable with distinct perceptual signature in Margot's witty, precise observations; dialogue carries subtext and advances plot naturally, like her nonchalance masking caution; rhythmic control heightens pressure in the revelation beat without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in descriptive beats like the lake's "cataract eye"; minor scaffold in repetitive pattern mentions (e.g., convergence echoes) dulls momentum slightly but doesn't touch closure; strong verbs and specific imagery propel without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography, linguistics, and climate apocalypse transforms tropes through specific details like asymmetric frost and dendritic rivulets; risk in the conceptual repricing heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the trust decision without gimmickry.</comment>
