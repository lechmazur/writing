<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Edgar's motivation is deeply rooted in trauma and hunger for connection, shown through embodied memories like the tape's oxide triggering his mother's voice; interior conflict balances hiding with kindly acts, culminating in an earned renunciation of full isolation with felt emotional cost. The archivist's secondary pressure heightens his internal contradictions without overwhelming the single-POV focus. Quick test satisfied as contradictory impulses (concealment vs. providence) drive the final stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered sense memories and acts of caching, leading to a Charged Poise closure where Edgar's realization reconfigures trust with conceptual cost of vulnerability; orientation anchors early in the crawl space at dawn. Persistent constraint of hidden spaces shapes tactics throughout. Cost is legible in the tightened hand on the tape and invitation acceptance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The shadowed library at dawn constrains Edgar's movements and gifts, with crawl spaces and pipes enabling his methodical providence; sensory details like flickering lights and dust motes charge the atmosphere and mirror his hidden existence. The environment directly charges the final image of amber rectangles, reweighting isolation. Quick test met as setting constrains choices and elevates closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of hidden guardianship vs. visibility tightens through the revelation of shared purpose, deepening via the archivist's invitation; under Accumulative lens, pattern break in her direct address forces stance crystallization with felt cost. Agency in lowering the light and planning to share tapes drives escalation. Cost is unmistakable in his vertigo-like strike and tightened grip.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preserving forgotten memories through trust emerges organically from Edgar's caches and the archivist's parallel efforts, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the invitation and his planned response. Subtext in gifts and whispers invites reflection on visibility's costs without moralizing. Final image reweights isolation's premise with ambiguity that lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV on Edgar remains stable, with perceptual signature in tactile details like cool pipes and dust motes; voice texture modulates rhythmically under emotional intensity, as in the cascade of sense memory. Dialogue is sparse but subtext-rich, like her whispered thanks and invitation, advancing the arc. No elision or head-hopping issues; quick test satisfied with distinct signature and control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high density in lines like the tape's oxide triggering memories; no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle, even in peak beats like the revelation. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in actions like lowering the light. Quick test met with zero artifacts and strong propulsion charging the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hidden dweller as memory guardian in a modernizing library transforms tropes through specific details like ferromagnetic fragments and kindly caches; risk in quiet, accumulative build heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry. Core premise feels inevitable via Edgar's trauma-rooted choices. No derivative echoes, with authenticity in the singular vision of trust as visibility.</comment>
