<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and rooted in his phobias, intensifying to compel the confrontation and reversal; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like trembling certainty transforming fear into precision. The final endurance reconfigures his identity with felt cost, foreclosing his old self. Jake as secondary character applies immediate pressure, shifting status dynamics in the climax. Minor slip in stock phobia labels without deeper contradiction in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Causal lens, because/therefore linkages drive from discovery to confrontation, with one meaningful tightening in the shell reunion; closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost as Jake collapses and Marcus reconfigures his fears. Orientation anchors early in the library under stars. Strong motivated ellipsis in the drive to the library pays off at closure without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars anchors vividly, with sensory details like chill metal and rotting paper filtered through Marcus's bias; environment constrains choices, as fallen shelves and stellar dust mirror his transformation. Recurring shell object charges the final image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly in the confrontation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of identity and betrayal tightens causally through the formulas, narrowing options to reversal; one deepening in decrypting the cast forces stance crystallization with felt cost in transferred fears. Agency drives the climax via Marcus's choice, foreclosing Jake's control. Coincidence of the child complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability as power emerges from events like fear transformation, with subtext in shell whispers and ironic stunt double role; final image offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting phobias without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity. Minor thematic echo in direct statements like "Vulnerability is power" slightly undercuts subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in fear-biased noticing; voice texture distinct in rhythmic whispers and grinding laughter. Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot, distinguishing characters. Minor register drift in expository interiority during confrontation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with momentum, varying rhythm in action beats; information density high in formulas and shell integration. Some paraphrase loops in reflection blocks, like repeated fear explanations, dull propulsion slightly. No major artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes sci-fi identity betrayal with stunt double irony freshly, transforming tropes through encoded cast and fear reversal; risk in conceptual repricing heightens stakes organically. Turns feel earned, with non-obvious shell payoff. Minor familiarity in handler-creator archetype.</comment>
