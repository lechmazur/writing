<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as a silent guardian is clear and consistent, driving her deliberate actions with the mirror and shutters to teach Thomas, culminating in his emotional release; Thomas's burden is embodied through hunched shoulders and tears, showing contradictory impulses in his initial freeze and later understanding. Interiority is concrete, with emotions like the dissolving "stone" in his throat avoiding stock phrasing. However, Mira's traits feel somewhat archetypal without deeper flaws complicating her choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through patterned images of light and shadow to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Thomas's secret dissolves with felt emotional cost in his tears and lighter walk; orientation anchors early with the cobalt dock and evening stars. Closure lands on-page with the mirror handover reweighting his grief. Minor redundancy in pattern descriptions doesn't break causality but slightly softens momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cobalt dock after rain is vividly specific, with puddles reflecting stars constraining and enabling Mira's light patterns, directly charging the final image of canal water carrying stars as spoken secrets. Sensory details like wet planks under bare feet and lapping water integrate into action, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Environment evolves causally, supporting theme through purposeful, POV-filtered detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of Thomas's unfinished confession tightens through Mira's shutter patterns, deepening to a cadence shift in his breathing and realization, with felt cost in tears and dissolved burden under the Accumulative lens. Pressure coheres via silent empathy, forcing stance crystallization without coincidence resolving it. One meaningful intensification suffices, but lacks a secondary accent for fuller escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of silent empathy valuing light in darkness emerges organically from shutter patterns and mirror reflections, culminating in a resonant final image of stars as spoken secrets without stated moral. Subtext in gestures like handing the mirror invites reflection on grief's complexity. Ending offers non-literal answer reweighting the premise with ambiguity, though some platitudes like "darkness teaches us to treasure light" border on direct statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable but subtly shifts focus between Mira and Thomas without head-hopping, with perceptual signature in poetic noticing of light and shadows; no dialogue present, so policy applies. Voice has distinct rhythmic texture in spiraling descriptions, but non-standard adverbs like "spiralingly" feel unmotivated. Elision is minimal and legible, supporting emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density in images like "miniature constellations across the wood," advancing atmosphere without loops, though mixed metaphors (water circling drain in reverse) create minor muddle in peak lesson beat. Rhythm varies naturally, but some overwriting in final paragraph with redundant star motifs dulls propulsion. No major artifacts obscure closure, and syntax supports pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dental mirror and shutters as tools for silent teaching transforms grief tropes into a non-obvious pattern of light, feeling inevitable with the mirror's reprise charging closure. Risk in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Avoids stock archetypes through specific cobalt dock details, though premise echoes familiar guardian-mentor dynamics.</comment>
