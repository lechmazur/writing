<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Amira's motivation is deeply rooted in trauma, driving micro-choices like pruning and transplanting that reveal contradictory impulses of grief and optimism; interiority is concrete and embodied, as in the somatic markers signaling panic, with emotions layered realistically without therapy-speak. The endurance in planting forecloses denial, earning stasis with visible cost in her persistent dirt-stained hands. Flaws like quiet talent complicate her isolation, shown through actions aligning with motives.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images of growth and destruction, culminating in a Charged Poise closure where the beacon's sweep reconfigures her persistence with conceptual cost of ongoing violence. Orientation anchors early in the arboretum setting. Minor ellipsis in backstory feels motivated but slightly loosens causality mid-story, though it pays off at ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the clifftop arboretum constraining choices like transplanting near the edge, charging the final image of waves eroding rock mirroring patient cultivation. Sensory details, like salt wind and gull cries, filter through Amira's bias, evolving causally with her actions. Micro-setting of plants and photograph integrates into pressure without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of anchoring optimism amid grief tightens through somatic tightening and memory surges, forcing stance crystallization in the pearl of stillness moment; cost is felt in foreclosed joy, legible in the photograph's charred edges. Under Textural lens, pattern break in wind shift deepens pressure without needing multiple reversals. Agency in planting endures with trade-off of indifference alignment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of persistent growth against erasure emerges organically from images like propagating jade and eroding cliffs, offering resonant non-literal answer in the final beacon sweep without moralizing. Subtext in plant-talents and somatic markers invites reflection on trauma's channels, embracing complexity. Emotional aftereffect lingers through honest ambiguity, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in nature-focused noticing, like branches reaching toward the sea; rhythmic control heightens in stress moments without compression issues. No dialogue, but prose texture reflects Amira's mind through purposeful syntax and elision. Patterned diction teaches lyric mode early, paying off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and no loops or artifacts; sentences like "White orchids everywhere, then white phosphorus, then white sheets" advance multiple layers concisely. Figurative language is controlled, enhancing clarity in peak beats without muddle. High information density integrates action and atmosphere seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma healing through botanical empathy transforms familiar grief tropes via specific details like somatic markers and drone-contextualized arboretum, feeling inevitable in the beacon's illumination. Risk in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Avoids derivative echoes through grounded ingenuity.</comment>
