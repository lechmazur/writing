<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sarai's motivation is clear and intensifies through visions, rooted in guilt and mercy, with embodied contradictions like weeping from "strange, cold warmth" revealing internal conflict. The final renunciation of her curse as punishment earns a meaningful change, foreclosing self-doubt with felt cost in her ongoing burden. The old man's presence applies secondary pressure, shifting status dynamics in their dialogue. Minor stock phrasing in emotional labels slightly dilutes specificity at peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, visions build density through patterned elision of past and present, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the curse becomes invitation, with conceptual cost legible in transformed purpose. Orientation anchors early in the plaza with the tessera, and causality holds via motivated visions without breaks. Closure lands on-page with the final vision of possibility, reweighting stakes. One meaningful deepening suffices, though ellipsis could teach its pattern more explicitly by midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ancient plaza under a shattered sky constrains choices, with frost and ruins embodying temporal fractures that charge visions; the tessera as recurring object reweights meaning in the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-biased, like warm tessera despite frost, mirroring internal warmth. Environment evolves causally, with mosaic patterns shifting to include her name, directly charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring meaning escalates accumulatively through visions, tightening via the mosaic's shift to name her, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in embracing painful transformation. One deepening—realizing curse as invitation—narrows options, driven by agency without coincidence resolving. Pressure coheres under lens, though cost could be more viscerally embodied in the climax vision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of transformative mercy emerges from visions and mosaic motifs, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in her "unclean hands" yet acceptance. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer to aberrant mercy, reweighting premise without statement. Subtext in dialogue and silences deepens complexity, eliciting emotional aftereffect through charged poise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Sarai's biased noticing of warmth amid cold; rhythmic control heightens under visions, like fragmented syntax in memories. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances plot, distinguishing voices—her poetic, his direct. Patterned elision in visions is taught early and pays off at closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in visions versus present, like the propulsive "world split open" opener. No significant loops or artifacts, though one paraphrase in fire vision slightly redunds; metaphors are coherent, such as "cradling empathy in arms of steel." Clarity and propulsion strong, advancing atmosphere without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognition and mercy transforms trope of cursed savior through specific mosaic mechanics and shattered sky, feeling inevitable with risk in nonlinear visions heightening stakes. Emotional specificity avoids generics, committing to premise without retreat. Minor hedging in balanced ambiguity slightly tempers boldness.</comment>
