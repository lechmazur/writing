<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to repair the drone is clear and rooted in her transformed perception post-blindness, with interiority embodied through sensory vibrations rather than stock labels; her flaw of blindness drives genuine struggle and competence, culminating in an earned endurance that forecloses doubt with felt cost in the release moment. Chen as secondary character applies relevant pressure via questions, revealing her values without stereotype. Minor weakness in occasional therapy-speak like "deeper connection to her craft," but it doesn't undermine the hierarchy of values shown in her deliberate motions under time pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure accumulates sensory patterns and mist resonances toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final release, with conceptual cost legible in Maya's tingling fingers and merged hum symbolizing harmony amid loss; orientation anchors early in the depot corner. Causality holds through textured deepenings like droplet acoustics, with one meaningful tightening in the patch adhesion under the loudspeaker urgency. Minor slip in backstory block slightly exceeding BRR allowance without fully tilting present stance, but it anchors her method without breaking momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mist-coated depot is vividly specific, with condensation and prismatic tubes constraining choices like drone positioning for refraction; sensory details are purposeful, filtered through Maya's bias toward sound and vibration, mirroring her internal reconfiguration. Environment evolves causally with rain collectors and mist vortexes, charging the final image of the drone merging with the horn. Recurring water droplets function as micro-setting that constrains repair tactics and heightens atmosphere without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of guiding the Meridian through fog is signaled early and deepens texturally via mist patterns and time pressure from the anchor lift, forcing stance crystallization in the precise patch application with visible cost in her heightened awareness. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation reads as density increase in vibrations and urgency, narrowing options without needing multiple reversals. Agency in renunciation of visual norms forecloses paths with felt emotional price in the release, though coincidence of depot mist complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of harmony in brokenness emerges organically from Maya's mist-decoded repairs and the drone's revival, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the final line about broken things waiting to be understood, reweighting her blindness as strength without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like finger-tingling and Chen's amazement invites reflection on perception beyond sight. Avoids sentimentality through concrete sensory struggle, though one platitude-like line ("Beauty isn't just visual") slightly dilutes complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV on Maya is stable, with perceptual signature in vibration and mist biases; voice texture distinct in rhythmic, sensory prose that modulates with pressure, like faster hands under the loudspeaker. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances plot, distinguishing characters—Maya's calm idioms versus Chen's amazement—without register mismatch. No head-hopping or unwarranted certainty; elision in backstory is taught and paid off in present tactics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "microscopic fractures" and "ultrasonic signals," varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold; final line recharges motifs effectively. Minor artifact in one paraphrase loop ("Every vibration, every sound, every shift") slightly dulls momentum but doesn't touch closure. Strong verbs and specific nouns propel beats, with clean mechanics and no figurative muddle in peak repair moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blindness as perceptual advantage via mist and drones transforms disability trope through specific sensory ingenuity, feeling inevitable in the vortex-tracking release; risk in lyric sensory mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on adaptation, with authenticity in voice avoiding stock archetypes. Minor hedging in balanced resolution slightly tempers boldness.</comment>
