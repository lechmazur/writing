<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mae's motivation is clear and intensifies through embodied longing, rooted in the past-life memory that compels her choices, culminating in the earned renunciation of capturing to release; interiority is concrete, with contradictory impulses like tasting ancient heartbreak while pursuing healing. The ghost as secondary character applies pressure, forcing Mae's micro-choices under stress. Flaws complicate her journey without hedging, shown in her unconscious preparations. However, some emotional progression feels slightly tidy, avoiding deeper irrationality in the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through layered revelations and pattern shifts, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mae releases images, reweighting her purpose with felt cost in the final image of being "empty and full simultaneously." Orientation anchors early with the viaduct and Mae's pilgrimage. Causality holds via motivated ellipses, like the vial's impulse buy paying off. Minor slip in ellipsis from memory surfacing to arrival, but it doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The twilight viaduct setting is vivid and purposeful, with wisteria and sparks constraining Mae's choices and charging the final image of glowing blooms; sensory details like humming frequency and copper taste are POV-filtered and evolve causally. Micro-setting of the camera obscura functions as a tool that reveals hidden layers, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Tone tensions the mystical atmosphere effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding unused love tightens through deepening revelations, narrowing options via breathing patterns and the tear, forcing stance crystallization in the release of photographs; cost is legible in Mae's transformed emptiness. Under Accumulative lens, pattern break in sparks erupting reweights stakes. Agency drives the intensification, with no coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of releasing unused love emerges organically from images like dissolving photographs and the repository, offering a resonant, non-literal answer in the final reconfiguration without moralizing; subtext in gestures and silences, like the ghost's whisper, invites reflection on healing through giving. Emotional aftereffect is concrete, avoiding sentimentality. Purposeful ambiguity lingers in Mae's changed darkroom purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Mae's mystical noticing of sparks and inverted worlds; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax that modulates with intensity. Dialogue is minimal but subtextual, like the ghost's whisper advancing the plot. Elision in memory integration is taught early and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like "shallow, then deep, then holding" to propel beats; metaphors like "prayer written in stone" are coherent and purposeful without muddle. No significant loops or artifacts, though occasional figurative layering in peak moments borders on density without obscuring clarity. Final line resolves with resonant image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of camera obscura as release tool and unused love repository transforms mystical tropes through specific details like Kwan Yin's tear and breathing patterns, feeling inevitable in hindsight; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generics, committing to the premise's implications.</comment>
