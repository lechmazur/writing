<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Yula's motivation to master stillness as navigation is rooted in consistent traits, intensifying through centuries to compel her endurance with the felt cost of immobility, shown in layered dust and synchronized heartbeat. Interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotions like the arrowhead's warmth aligning with her pulse, revealing contradictory impulses between past ambition and present resolve. The earned stasis at closure forecloses movement forever, with visible cost in her weathered form, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered echoes and patterns to a resonant reconfiguration via the returning pulse, creating earned stasis with conceptual cost of centuries spent unmoving. Orientation anchors who (Yula), where (bone tower in canyon), and when (three hundred years) by the first paragraph, serving closure without disorientation. One continuous scene fits scope, with meaningful deepening in the pulse's return, though a slight ellipsis in memory access feels under-motivated, not breaking causality at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The canyon of endless echoes and bone towers is vividly specific, with calcified remains and acoustic libraries constraining Yula's stillness and charging the final image of her as a fixed point amid temporal currents. Sensory details like dust coating her shoulders and vultures' shadows are purposeful, filtered through her reverent POV, mirroring internal stasis. The micro-setting of her perch and arrowhead evolves causally, guiding choices without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of navigating time in stillness tightens through pattern breaks like the swallows' message and returning pulse, reweighting options with the cost of eternal immobility. One meaningful deepening suffices, forcing stance crystallization in her whispered response, though the pressure feels more conceptual than visceral at peak. Agency in endurance forecloses paths with felt cost in layered dust.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of stillness as profound navigation emerges organically from images like echoing pulses and bird patterns, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in silence and implication, such as the arrowhead's warmth drawing history, invites reflection on time and presence. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through weathered resolve, embracing complexity in her unchanged yet transformed state.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward acoustic and avian patterns, modulating rhythmically under the story's quiet intensity. Prose texture is distinct in lyric syntax and purposeful compression, teaching patterns early for legibility at closure. Minimal dialogue feels natural and subtextual, advancing the accumulative drive without artificiality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and high information density, as in "dust coated her shoulders like a second skin" advancing character and atmosphere without loops. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the pulse's return. Clarity shines in concise sentences that multitask, with zero scaffold or artifacts dulling the resonant closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The premise of a stone skimmer navigating time via echoes and stillness offers fresh synthesis, transforming tropes of immobility into bold ingenuity with risk-taking that heightens conceptual stakes. Originality in particulars like bone towers as sound libraries feels inevitable, committing to implications without hedging. The returning voice reconfiguration arises organically, avoiding derivative echoes.</comment>
