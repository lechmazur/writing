<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Martha's motivation to carve collective grief is clear and intensifies through her grandfather's guidance, with embodied emotions in her meditative state and micro-choices like retracing names; internal conflict shows in her urgent work against the migration deadline, earning the endurance of loss with felt cost at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned motifs of ribbons and butterflies, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the families' gathering and poem discovery; causality holds via deepening grief layers, with orientation anchored early in the greenhouse; closure lands with conceptual cost of fading spectral presence, charged by the final wind-carried words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse at dusk constrains choices by framing the carving and migration, with milkweed and glass walls charging the final image of butterflies departing; sensory details like cool glass and salmon sky are purposeful, mirroring internal calm amid grief, and evolve causally with darkening skies.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of weaving collective grief escalates texturally through urgent carving and monarch restlessness, tightening via grandfather's warnings; one meaningful deepening in the families' touching the stone forces stance crystallization with emotional cost, though coincidence of early monarchs complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of collective grief as migratory strength emerges organically from ribbon motifs and poems, culminating in a resonant final image of wind-carried words without stated moral; subtext in spectral guidance and family customs deepens ambiguity, inviting reflection on loss's transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual bias toward carving details and butterflies; voice texture in rhythmic, image-rich prose modulates with pressure, like shortened sentences during urgent work; dialogue is natural and subtextual, advancing mentorship without excess; no head-hopping or unwarranted certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in meditative passages like "Grief has grain, like wood"; no loops or artifacts obscure closure, with strong verbs and specific images propelling momentum; final line recharges motifs cleanly, avoiding overwriting in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spectral mentorship with butterfly migration transforms grief tropes through specific ribbon weaving and poem-trading custom; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable at the poem discovery.</comment>
