<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to translate silence is clear and rooted in her traits, intensifying through micro-choices like repeated shutter clicks that reveal contradictory impulses of loss and creation. Chen, as secondary character, applies pressure via gestures that force Maya's stance crystallization, with status dynamics legible in their advisor-friend dynamic. Interiority is embodied, as in the "familiar ache of beauty without sound," avoiding stock phrasing. The final renunciation of sound-based music earns stasis with felt cost of forgotten legacy, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned gestures and clicks, culminating in a Charged Poise closure where silence becomes a beginning, with conceptual cost of lost melodies reconfigured into visual symphony. Orientation anchors early in the harbor under moonlight. Causality holds via textural density increase, with one meaningful deepening in their dawn work. The final image reweights the stake, meeting the 9+ test with persistent camera constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The luminous harbor anchors vividly early, with moonlight and waves constraining choices by providing a concert hall that mirrors internal silence. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, like "spilled mercury" reflecting Maya's bias, evolving causally to gold at dawn. Environment charges the final image as they leave footprints, but lacks full 9+ constraint on a specific choice. Tone supports theme through intentional tension between beauty and absence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming memory through silence signals early and deepens via mapping and gestures, forcing stance crystallization under Situational pressure borrowed in Hybrid lens, with one tightening in their collaborative translation. Agency in Maya's clicks and Chen's signs forecloses sound-based paths with felt cost of isolation. Escalation reads as density increase reweighting the stake, driven by protagonist choices. Cost is unmistakable in the ache of forgotten work, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of bridging silence and memory emerges organically from images like empty clicks and signed symphonies, inviting reflection on loss without tidy morals. Subtext in gestures and "joyful sorrow" elicits emotional aftereffect through complexity, with the final image offering a resonant answer by repricing silence as beginning. Epiphanies earn from struggle, as in the dawn realization. Meets 9+ test by reweighting prior material non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Maya's biased noticing of silence frequencies. Voice texture distinct in rhythmic, gesture-focused prose, modulating with intensity like fluid signs despite arthritis. Signed "dialogue" is natural, subtextual, and advances plot via interpretation. Elision in reflections is taught and paid off at closure, satisfying 9+ test without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, as sentences like "The harbor glowed like spilled mercury" advance atmosphere and character. Rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops, though minor scaffold in repetitive "click" could trim. No artifacts obscure closure; metaphors cohere without muddle. Opening anchors voice, final line resolves with resonant image, but peak beats have slight figurative density without full pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sign language symphonies and silent photography transforms tropes of loss into non-obvious visual music, feeling inevitable via Maya's backstory. Risk in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, with emotional specificity in "joyful sorrow" avoiding generics. Core premise commits fully, with bold quiet ending. Meets 9+ test through specific, hindsight-inevitable reconfiguration.</comment>
