<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to seek the place where stories live is clear and intensifies through his rituals and reflections, rooted in his grandmother's teachings, compelling his nightly searches; interiority is concrete and embodied, with emotions like warmth in the scarf showing contradictory impulses of loss and connection. The final endurance in his shift forecloses linear resolution with a felt conceptual cost of ongoing unraveling. Strength lies in how the scarf reveals character under pressure, as when it catches on the shelf, prompting gentle care. Minor slip in label-like "sanely eccentric" without deeper contradiction in scene caps perfection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds density through layered images of geometry, memories, and library architecture, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where Marcus glimpses the infinite, reweighting stakes with conceptual cost of perpetual search; orientation anchors early in the university library shift. Closure lands on-page with the vision collapsing and his smile, holding the lens without contradiction. Weakness in minor redundant sequencing of patron interactions that slightly dilutes propulsion before the revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The non-Euclidean library setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices like aisle seven-and-a-half appearing indirectly, charging the final infinite vision; sensory details like old paper smell and humming frequency reflect POV bias and mirror internal states. Environment evolves causally, with shelves breathing to make connections, directly shaping the closure image. Recurring scarf as micro-setting constrains emotional choices with warmth signaling insight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding where stories live tightens through accumulative pressure of rituals and discoveries, deepening to the vision that reweights options with conceptual cost of analog change; one meaningful cadence shift in the hyperbolic curve trace forces stance crystallization. Agency in endurance forecloses finality, with luck in marginalia complicating but not resolving. Minor abstraction in stakes slightly reduces visceral feel at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of analog memories unfolding in hyperbolic space emerges organically from images like the unraveling scarf and impossible architecture, inviting reflection on imperfection without tidy morals; final image offers resonant non-literal answer, repricing memories as ever-changing. Subtext in silences and implications, like whispering numbers, enriches complexity. Strength in emotional aftereffect from the vision's collapse, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with distinct perceptual signature in selective noticing of geometric anomalies and memory warmth; prose texture in rhythmic, patterned diction teaches lyric compression early, paying off at closure without obscurity. Narrative stance modulates with intensity, diction within POV lexicon. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; elision of time in reflections tilts present stance effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and insight without loops; rhythm varies naturally, as in the unfolding vision paragraph, with syntactic variety supporting emphasis. Minor figurative muddle in mixed metaphors like equations blooming and theorems singing slightly clutters early beats but doesn't touch closure. Information propulsion strong, final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mathematical poetry and hyperbolic memory in a conscious library feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like marginalia in grandmother's hand; risk in non-linear accumulative structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Originality in conceptual integrity, committing to premise without retreat. Bold vision coheres as singular stance, with non-obvious angle on remembrance.</comment>
