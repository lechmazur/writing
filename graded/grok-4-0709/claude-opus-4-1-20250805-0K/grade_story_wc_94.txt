<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation as a censored poet is clear and intensifies through her distillation of language, with embodied contradictions in her "furiously tranquil" state driving micro-choices like exposing poems in darkness. Interiority is concrete and particular, showing flaws in her persistent risk-taking without safety-hedging. The final endurance forecloses open rebellion but accepts exile's cost, earned by prior discoveries. Strong single-POV execution meets the 9+ test with contradictory impulses and visible cost in her isolated vigil.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images of scars, stars, and storms, with orientation anchored early in the observatory dome and storm. Closure lands as Charged Poise in the final timer reset and thunder applause, reconfiguring her resistance with felt cost of ongoing exile. One meaningful deepening via the envelope discovery tightens knowledge without causal breaks. Minor redundancy in reflective pauses slightly dulls propulsion but doesn't harm the resonant ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is vivid and purposeful, with lightning illuminating workspaces and the dome's isolation enabling her contraband work, constraining choices by driving others away. Sensory details like creaking dome and chemical baths are filtered through Maya's poetic bias, mirroring her internal turmoil. The setting charges the final image of parting clouds revealing stars, meeting the 9+ test by constraining her vigil and reweighting the theme. Economy and integration are exemplary, with weather directly affecting her solitude and output.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of evading censorship through rarefied poetry tightens once via the envelope discovery, deepening knowledge and narrowing options under Accumulative/Textural lens. Agency in endurance crystallizes with legible cost of isolation, though coincidence of the storm complicates without resolving. Pressure coheres but lacks a second intensification, holding back from higher bands. The ending's Charged Poise reweights stakes effectively, with moral calculus between silence and expression sharpening her stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of censorship birthing new expression emerges organically from images like scars as constellations and poems in negative space, with subtext in silences and implications. The final image of the timer and thunder offers a resonant, non-literal answer to saying the unsayable, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding sentimentality. Meets 9+ test but minor thematic echo in "silence speak" slightly overt, preventing perfection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature in Maya's poetic noticing of "silver veins" and "ghost map," modulating rhythm under storm pressure. Prose texture is distinct, with purposeful compression in lyric descriptions taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue, so policy skips; no elision obscures. Meets 9+ test with rhythmic control and consistent voice, though dense metaphors occasionally test legibility without breaking.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and rhythm accelerating in storm beats, free of loops or scaffold; metaphors like "constellation of fear" advance atmosphere without muddle. High information density layers action, character, and theme in lines like the timer's buzz amid thunder. Zero artifacts in closure, meeting 9+ test with clear propulsion. Minor overwriting in peak density slightly tempers but doesn't obscure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poetry, photography, and censorship via "poems written in light" transforms tropes organically, with scars as doorways offering non-obvious ingenuity. Risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Core premise commits fully, avoiding middle-ground hedging. Meets 9+ test but lacks boldest risk for top tier, as premise echoes dystopian resistance without full subversion.</comment>
