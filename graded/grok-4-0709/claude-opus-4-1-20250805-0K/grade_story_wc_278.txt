<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to translate and resolve generational guilt is clear and intensifies through her use of the amber pendant, compelling her high-stakes tattooing; interiority is embodied in her perceptual focus on frequencies and the pendant's warmth, with contradictory impulses shown in her careful unpacking amid the crying static. Dr. Kepler applies secondary pressure effectively as a summoner, forcing Mara's engagement. The final renunciation of the ghosts' pain is earned with the visible cost of the cracked amber.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered revelations of the firmware's ghosts, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the tattooed constellation reweights digital guilt into acknowledgment with the cost of the fractured pendant; orientation anchors who (Mara), where (laboratory), and when (temporal fold) in the opening sentence. No causality breaks, as each descriptive beat deepens the haunting pattern toward resonant silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Laboratory of Lost Sounds is vividly specific, with temporal folds and amplified frequencies constraining Mara's actions, such as using the atmosphere to tether ghosts; the amber pendant functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image by cracking and twitching. Sensory details like humming frequencies and flickering screens are filtered through Mara's bias, mirroring her internal gift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resolving the firmware's haunted cries signals early and deepens through the crying's evolution into language, forcing Mara's agency in tattooing with the cost of her heirloom cracking; under Accumulative/Textural lens, this cadence shift reweights the stake without needing multiple reversals. The resolution crystallizes her stance, with coincidence (time fold) complicating but not resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of acknowledging deleted existences emerges through recurring images like trapped mosquitoes and ghostly code, culminating in the non-literal final message "Thank you for remembering us" that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in the amber's hum and cracked state invites reflection on inherited guilt. Emotional aftereffect is a quiet resonance of transformed dissonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV on Mara is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in hearing subsonic frequencies; voice texture is poetic and rhythmic, modulating with pressure like the shifting crying, without head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and subtextual, as in Dr. Kepler's "meteor hush" line pursuing explanation. Patterned elision in time's folding is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, as in the opening's folded time imagery advancing atmosphere without loops; metaphors like "pages in a closing book" are coherent and purposeful, though some density in peak tattooing borders on overwriting but serves textural escalation. No artifacts obscure closure, with high information density in lines like the amber cracking.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of tattooing digital ghosts with prehistoric amber transforms familiar haunting tropes into a fresh angle on technological guilt; risk-taking in surreal elements like air-tattooing heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the pulsing constellation's lullaby. No derivative echoes, with authenticity in the singular vision of lost sounds.</comment>
