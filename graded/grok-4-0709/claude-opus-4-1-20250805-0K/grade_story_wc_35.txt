<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Miran's motivation to smooth memories intensifies compellingly to compel her high-stakes choice to subsume the remorse, with interiority concrete and embodied in her trembling hands and scarred fingertips; emotions are contradictory and rooted in her gift's curse, shown through her sturdy yet brittle core without stock phrasing. The final endurance earns its cost by foreclosing ignorance, visible in her heavy body post-absorption. Minor slip in over-articulated sorrow labels slightly abstracts the peak emotional layering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, textural density builds through memory floods to a resonant reconfiguration where Miran metabolizes remorse into acceptance, with felt cost in her internal scouring like a sandstorm; orientation anchors early in the desert fortress post-rain. Closure lands on-page with the pools reflecting sorrow-free stars, reweighting the stake. Slight ambiguity in time compression during absorption mildly softens causality but doesn't break the pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The desert fortress after rain is vividly specific, with tidal pools mirroring constellations and geometric ridges constraining Miran's choice to touch and subsume; sensory details like salt-taste and wind-whisper evolve with events, charging the final star-reflection image. Micro-setting of the pool as an "eye" pressures her gift's activation. Environment mirrors her internal transformation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of confronting the fortress's haunting escalates texturally through emotional contagion spreading like fever, tightening to her decision to subsume with visible cost in internal scouring; one meaningful deepening via the pavilion's pulse narrows options under Accumulative lens. Pressure coheres to force stance crystallization. Coincidence of rain complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of metabolizing stored remorse into acceptance emerges organically from Miran's gift and the pavilion's regrets, with subtext in unspoken dreams and weeping stones; final image of clear pools and forgiving wind offers resonant, non-literal repricing without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity of her burden as salvation. Avoids sentimentality via embodied cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in taste-memories like salt and sorrow; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, lyric compression that teaches patterned elision early, paying off at closure. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets. Psychic distance shifts intentionally with stress, maintaining voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like "time moved differently when you were swallowing centuries"; metaphors cohere without muddle, though minor scaffold in repeated "taste" phrasing slightly loops in the absorption beat. Propulsion strong, advancing atmosphere without artifacts touching closure. Read-aloud flows naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of a memory-tasting chef subsuming calcified regrets in a drowned pavilion feels inevitable, transforming desert-haunting tropes through specific gift mechanics and emotional contagion; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on exile and forgiveness. Authenticity coheres as singular vision.</comment>
