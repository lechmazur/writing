<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is deeply rooted in her expertise with death and recoveries, intensifying through micro-choices like photographing and writing in the journal, revealing contradictory impulses of preservation versus letting go; interiority is concrete and embodied, with emotions layered in her breath catching at the snow globe; the final renunciation of the library's physical form earns stasis with conceptual cost, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned discoveries from transmission to ascent, with orientation anchored by paragraph two in the underwater library; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing in Marina's note and ascent, reweighting loss as transformation with undeniable conceptual cost; one meaningful deepening suffices, though causality feels more textural than strictly motivated in the invitation's reveal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The sunken library setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like verdigris handles and contracting air pocket constraining choices and charging the final ascent; POV filters familiarity through Marina's expertise, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism; the snow globe as micro-setting evolves causally, heightening thematic resonance at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding loss escalates through the contracting air pocket, forcing stance crystallization under Situational pressure within the Accumulative lens; one tightening via the shifting water narrows options, with agency in writing the note foreclosing physical preservation for conceptual transformation; cost is legible in the library's impending flood, though coincidence of the air pocket complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transformation over decay emerges organically from snow globe recursion and captain's equations, inviting reflection through ambiguity without confusion; subtext in infinite regression offers resonant, non-literal answer to letting go, reweighting premise at closure; avoids moralizing, with emotional honesty in sophisticated melancholy charging the sunset surface break.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature biased toward analytic observation like frequency whispers; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, compressed syntax that heightens discoveries, teaching patterned elision early; no dialogue, but prose modulates under pressure without register drift, paying off at charged ascent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and high information in images like the snow globe's recursion; minor scaffold in repetitive frequency motifs, but no loops obscure closure; figurative language coheres without muddle, accelerating at peak like the shifting water, though some elevated diction borders on overwriting without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Earhart discovery with recursive snow globe transforms disappearance tropes through Marina's analytic lens, feeling inevitable in hindsight; risk in lyric, textural buildup heightens stakes organically, committing to conceptual integrity without gimmickry; the infinite regression inflects boldly, personalizing theme beyond stock archaeology narratives.</comment>
