<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her grandmother's teachings, intensifying to compel her high-stakes choice to ring the bell over using the switch, with embodied emotion in her bone-felt vibrations; interiority is concrete, showing contradictory impulses between modern tech and ancient wisdom in the pivotal decision moment. Flaws complicate choices authentically, like doubting if villagers will believe a warning in calm weather, leading to earned endurance with felt cost as she watches the avalanche from her post. The single-POV focus excels in revealing hierarchy of values through micro-choices, such as gripping the rope instead of the switch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, the structure builds through motivated because/therefore linkages, from detecting anomalies to pulling the bell, culminating in a Decisive Change with visible cost as Mara foregoes easy tech for primal warning, saving lives butರಲು. Orientation anchors who (Mara), where (sanctuary), and when (winter solstice pre-dawn) by 120 words. Closure lands on-page with Resonant Reconfiguration, reweighting her role from observer to guardian, with felt cost in her solitary vigil amid the storm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The windblown sanctuary above clouds is vividly specific, with sensory details like humming stones and crystalline air filtered through Mara's expert POV, constraining her choices by isolating her yet enabling perfect sound travel. Environmental elements like the still air and vanishing animals pressure her decision, mirroring her internal hush. The setting evolves causally with the avalanche reshaping the landscape, charging the final image of ice crystals chiming like bells.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of village lives signals early, tightening through subtle signs like vibrations and animal flight, forcing Mara's agency in choosing the bell over switch, narrowing options with moral calculus between believable warnings. Under Causal lens, escalation narrows via pressure readings and bone-felt hum, culminating in stance crystallization with visible cost as she remains at post during the storm. One meaningful deepening suffices, with luck (storm timing) complicating but not resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of listening to ancient whispers over modern noise emerges organically from Mara's choices and motifs like the solstice hush, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in blending old and new. Subtext in her hesitation and the bell's primal authority invites reflection on wisdom's forms. The final image of chiming ice crystals offers resonant, non-literal repricing of silence as guardian power without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Mara's weather-tuned noticing of humidity shifts and stone vibrations, modulating distance intentionally for emotional beats like closing eyes to listen. Prose texture is distinct with rhythmic, purposeful syntax reflecting her contemplative state, accelerating in the bell-pulling climax. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; no elision or slippage issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "cloud tops smooth as fresh snow" without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, with strong verbs and specific nouns propelling momentum. Minor overwriting in peak beats, like stacked descriptors in the humming stones, but no clarity harm at closure. Opening anchors voice stakes; final line resolves by recharging bell motif with ice crystals.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tech-tradition clash in a high-altitude sanctuary feels inevitable, transforming avalanche trope through Mara's bone-listening and solstice hush, with non-obvious risk in trusting whispers over data. Emotional specificity in her guardian shift avoids generics, cohering as singular vision. One fresh inflection in layered warning heightens stakes organically.</comment>
