<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kira's motivation to overcome her crystalline condition through rune creation intensifies compellingly, with embodied stress manifesting in fractal patterns that drive her micro-choice to hold her breath and draw from scars; interiority is concrete, showing contradictory impulses like dismissing then embracing superstition; the final renunciation of shame earns stasis with felt emotional cost, as seen in the glittering dust shedding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure builds through stress-induced crystallization and memory accrual, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where Kira reweights her affliction as strength; closure lands on-page with visible cost in shed crystals and transformed shame; orientation anchors early on the floating platform, with held breath constraining tactics toward the rune-drawing climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The floating stone platform and breath-between-storms atmosphere constrain Kira's test, with swaying and hush pressuring her held breath; sensory details like steaming tea and glittering dust are selective and POV-filtered, mirroring internal crystallization; the setting evolves causally, tilting at peak stress to charge the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of creating an original rune tightens through accumulating stress and crystallization, forcing stance crystallization under Situational pressure borrowed in Hybrid lens; agency in holding breath and tracing scars drives deepening with unmistakable cost in lung-screaming release and shed shame; one meaningful intensification suffices, narrowing options to personal transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transforming flaws into strengths emerges organically from Kira's scars becoming a rune, with subtext in grandmother's rhyme repricing superstition as truth; final image of pulsing rune and approaching thunder offers resonant, non-literal answer to embracing affliction, reweighting prior dismissal without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in her bloomed scholarship, inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable, with perceptual signature biased toward crystalline sensations and rune details; prose texture distinct in rhythmic builds like "ink flowed like liquid starlight"; dialogue is sparse but natural, subtextual in Master Yuen's "Breathe" amid tension; no head-hopping, with stress compressing diction purposefully at climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in builds like the held-breath sequence; metaphors like "frost on glass" are coherent and purposeful without muddle; minor scaffold in repetitive "held breath" phrasing deducts slightly, but propulsion remains strong, advancing atmosphere and character without loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of affliction as rune-language transforms familiar mentorship trope through specific crystalline trait and superstition revisit; risk in accumulative structure heightens stakes via personal autobiography in the rune, feeling inevitable at shedding moment; originality shines in non-obvious scar-to-story premise without gimmickry.</comment>
