<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is clear and intensifies through her tapping rhythm, rooted in grandmother's legacy, compelling her to dive for truth; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions in the insistent tapping on surfaces that reveal contradictory impulses between official data and personal revelation. The final choice to lower the station feels earned by prior perceptual shifts, foreclosing surface-level understanding with a felt cost of delayed generations. No second character on-page, so relationship bullets ignored; strength lies in micro-choices like aligning the atlas page, showing value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through rhythmic patterns and perceptual deepenings, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the reef-as-town realization reweights the premise with conceptual cost of misunderstanding; orientation anchors early with the station above the reef. One meaningful deepening suffices, as shadows and atlas alignment tighten knowledge; strength in the final image of descending station, but minor ellipsis in grandmother's hints slightly softens causality without breaking lens hold.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the monitoring station constraining choices via instruments and glass, while the bleached reef below mirrors internal transformation; sensory details like humming measurements and shimmering coral are filtered through Lena's bias, evolving to reveal architectural shapes. The recurring atlas page as object charges the final image by fluttering away, constraining her realization; tone tensions tragedy with hope, supporting theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, dominant stake of uncovering transformation escalates via pattern break in tapping symphony, reweighting the reef from death to patience with conceptual cost; one deepening through shadows and alignments narrows options, forcing stance crystallization. Agency in deciding to dive forecloses ignorance with felt price of generations delayed; strength in moral calculus between endings and metamorphoses, but coincidence of atlas find slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of transformation over death emerges organically from tapping patterns and coral shapes, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the descending station image that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in rhythms and diary hints invites reflection on patience; emotional aftereffect arises from concrete particulars like the fluttering atlas page, avoiding sentimentality. Strength in final line "Some messages take generations to deliver," which recharges prior motifs without direct statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in rhythmic tapping and biased noticing of coral shadows; prose texture distinct through varied syntax mirroring insistence, like shifting rhythms. No dialogue, so ignored; purposeful compression in realizations teaches pattern, paid off at closure without elision issues. Strength in prose as character, with syntax reflecting mind under revelation pressure in the symphony-building moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere via vivid images like "white as funeral bones"; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops, though minor template cadence in tapping descriptions repeats stems without payoff harm. No artifacts obscure closure; strength in final line's propulsion, recharging motifs with clear syntax. Figurative language controlled, no muddle in peak beats like the revelation assembly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality in synthesizing climate disaster with metamorphic transformation, fresh angle on bleaching as preservation rather than death; risk in lyric rhythms heightens stakes organically. Core premise feels inevitable via grandmother's "periodically eternal," transforming tropes like lost towns; strength in non-obvious synthesis at "paths transcribed" line, but familiarity of eco-revelation slightly hedges boldness.</comment>
