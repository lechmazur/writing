<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to harmonize conflicts is clear and intensifies through her plan, rooted in generational traits and embodied in her trembling recognition of the solution's cruelty-kindness mix. Interiority is concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses like hiding care in strategy shown in her carved plans and unclaimed credit. The resolution earns stasis by accepting interdependence's cost, visible in forcing collaboration without acknowledgment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned reflections and motifs like breathing stone and flowing water, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara's plan reweights community stakes with conceptual cost of hidden compassion. Orientation anchors early with the amphitheater and Mara's purpose. Closure lands on-page with felt cost in the "elegant cruelty," though one more explicit tightening could sharpen the cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The crumbling amphitheater inside a dormant volcano is vividly specific, with thermal breathing constraining Mara's measurements and charging the final image of patient power. Sensory details like stone rhythm and evening shadows filter through her POV, mirroring internal balance. Environment evolves causally, guiding her plan and thematic resonance without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconciling water rights tightens through her plan's crystallization, deepening via the trembling moment that narrows options to encrypted compassion under Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in the intertwined cruelty-kindness, forcing trade-offs like unclaimed credit. One meaningful deepening suffices, but coincidence of resin discovery slightly complicates without fully resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of encrypted compassion emerges organically from Mara's actions and motifs like mixed resin, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the solution's cruelty. Subtext in gestures like kissing the chain invites reflection on hidden care. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer by repricing interdependence without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with distinct perceptual signature in selective noticing of rhythms and resins, modulating rhythm under pressure like the trembling plan. Prose texture is purposeful and lyric, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. No dialogue, so policy skips; elision pays off in resonant ending without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in breathing motifs and avoiding loops, though one paraphrase in water-teaching interdependence slightly echoes earlier flow ideas. Figurative language like "stone lungs" is controlled without muddle, propelling toward closure. No major artifacts touch the ending, maintaining clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of engineering, heritage, and volcanic metaphor transforms conflict tropes into non-obvious harmony via hidden plans, feeling inevitable in her grandmother's lesson. Risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise commits fully, avoiding middle-ground hedging.</comment>
