<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to solve engineering puzzles is clear and rooted in her curious traits, intensifying through her actions like redirecting flows, leading to an earned realization of hope's equations. Interiority is concrete, with embodied excitement and stoic wonder, though some phrases like "growing excitement" feel slightly stock. The single-POV focus reveals character through micro-choices under pressure, such as using the sextant as a key, without unearned epiphanies. Flaws like persistence despite rust and protests add genuine struggle, but emotional progression could layer more contradictory impulses in the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure progresses logically from arrival and discovery to activation and realization, with because/therefore linkages like finding the sextant enabling flow redirection. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing in the dawn scene, where the terminal's resurrection reweights infrastructure as hope's machine with conceptual cost of lost time and abandonment legible in the final image. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first paragraph, avoiding penalties. One meaningful tightening suffices, but the ending explain-everything summary slightly softens causality without breaking it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport terminal is vividly anchored with neon afterglow, confetti, and cracked floors, evolving causally as Maya activates pipes and the fountain erupts. Sensory details like rust flaking and water arcing are selective and purposeful, filtered through Maya's engineering POV, constraining her choices like tracing junctions. The setting pressures the narrative by revealing hidden genius, charging the final image of precise parabolas. Minor generic elements like "dawn approached" don't detract from overall specificity and coherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><grade>Under the Causal lens, the dominant stake of solving impossible equations escalates through one meaningful tightening when water flows and the fountain erupts, narrowing options to transcription with felt cost of dormant years. Pressure coheres but remains somewhat abstract, with no strong reversal forcing trade-offs; the resolution feels earned yet lacks visceral price in the positive reconfiguration. Agency is active in redirection, but coincidence of the carnival unearthing the sextant complicates without resolving. Moral calculus between traditional engineering and creative genius sharpens the peak subtly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of engineering hope through infrastructure emerges organically from events like activating the maze of intentions, culminating in a resonant final image of water arcs without stated morals. Subtext in pipes as choices and flows as aspirations invites reflection on human aspiration, with purposeful ambiguity in the terminal's dormancy. Emotional aftereffect is concrete via stoic wonder, avoiding sentimentality, though some direct statements like "proof that infrastructure could carry dreams" border on assertion. The core concept integrates tightly, reweighting the premise in the closure without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; POV is stable third-person close on Maya, with perceptual signature in engineering-focused noticing like pipe junctions as decisions. Voice has distinct texture in rhythmic, purposeful syntax, modulating with intensity in the activation scene, though some sentences drift into elevated register like "the permanent enchantment of infrastructure." Elision is minimal and taught, with no head-hopping or unreliability issues. Psychic distance serves beats, but occasional filter verbs like "she understood" slightly dull immediacy without voice motivation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing through vivid images like water arcing in parabolas, but occasional paraphrase loops like repeating "equations" and "hope" in the ending dull momentum. Rhythm varies naturally, with strong verbs and specific nouns, though some overwriting in figurative strings like "maze of intentions" mixes metaphors without payoff. No major artifacts obscure closure, but template cadence in reflective blocks like "She understood now why..." triggers minor deduction. Clarity is strong, with clean grammar and propulsion, elevating the resurrection beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise of a spaceport as a navigational hope machine offers fresh synthesis of engineering and aspiration, transforming tropes like abandoned tech through specific details like hydraulic celestial mapping. Originality shines in the bold risk of conceptual resurrection, heightening stakes organically without gimmickry, as in the fountain's eruption reweighting the maze. Emotional truth feels authentic, avoiding generics, though proximity to sci-fi discovery arcs is close without full subversion. Commitment to the vision coheres, with the sextant reprise feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
