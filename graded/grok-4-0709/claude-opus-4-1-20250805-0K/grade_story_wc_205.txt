<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cassia's motivation as a failed revolutionary is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in consistent traits like poetic cadence that reveal her under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotions, such as surprising herself with familiar fire, showing contradictory impulses in scene. Huang as secondary character applies relevant pressure through dispute, forcing her stance crystallization. The final renunciation of defeat's finality is earned with visible emotional cost, transforming sorrow into a lens. Minor stock phrasing in unnamed emotions slightly dilutes specificity at peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first paragraph with the shard and asteroid; structure holds as one continuous scene under Accumulative/Textural lens, with density increasing through temporal patterns and revolutionary echoes. Closure lands as Charged Poise in Cassia's smile and plan, reconfiguring defeat into victory with felt cost in burnished sorrow, legible on the page. One meaningful deepening via the shard's refraction tightens knowledge, holding the lens without contradiction; persistent constraint of exile shapes her tactics toward resurrection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting of the baroque asteroid is vivid and purposeful, with visible time streams and covered mirrors constraining choices and charging the final image of the temporal storm painting history. Sensory details are selective, filtered through Cassia's POV bias as a revolutionary, mirroring her internal states subtly through sparking atmosphere and weeping cherubs. Environment evolves causally with the storm's approach, affecting action and tone without static repetition. The micro-setting of the shard as object functions integrally, anchoring specificity and pressuring the dispute's outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resurrecting the Venusian civilization signals early and tightens once through the shard's ghostly revelation, deepening knowledge under Accumulative/Textural lens with coherent pressure forcing Cassia's stance crystallization. Agency drives escalation via her proposal, narrowing options with moral calculus between protocols and preservation; cost is felt in unshed tears and burnished sorrow, charging the final image. Coincidence of the storm complicates but does not resolve; one meaningful intensification suffices, though secondary accent of personal defeat could interweave more explicitly for higher stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of resurrection from defeat emerges organically from images like the shard and covered mirrors, with subtext in whispers and ghosts inviting reflection on preservation without direct statements. Ending offers resonant, non-literal repricing of defeat as preparation, reweighting prior material through Cassia's realization without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars like her prison poems and alien desperation, embracing complexity with ambiguity in possibilities shown in mirrors. Coherent integration with core concept avoids sentimentality, though one platitude-like line on revolutions in imagination slightly tempers resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and controlled, with perceptual signature biased toward revolutionary patterns and temporal readings, modulating distance intentionally for emotional beats. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax reflecting Cassia's mind, with purposeful compression in reflections anchored by cues like the shard. Dialogue is natural, subtext-laden, and goal-driven, distinguishing characters through Huang's nervous adjustments versus Cassia's verse-like cadence; no head-hopping or register mismatch. Elision in backstory is taught early and pays off at closure, enhancing legibility under the lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing character and atmosphere through vivid images like frozen tears and weeping cherubs; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the revelation beat without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled, though one mixed metaphor of time as ribbons and rivers in quick succession slightly muddles in a peak moment. Clarity holds with strong verbs and specific details, no artifacts obscuring closure; final line recharges motifs effectively. Minor register drift into elevated diction like "burnished bright" fits voice but borders on overwriting in the ending image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of visible time, Venusian archaeology, and revolutionary parallels feels inevitable, transforming sci-fi tropes through Cassia's specific worldview and the shard's evolving role. Bold risk in lyric, textural buildup heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise implications like mirror possibilities. Fresh inflection in conceptualizing defeat as preparation arises from particulars, avoiding generic abstractions; authenticity coheres as singular vision. Proximity to familiar motifs like preserved civilizations is subverted meaningfully via personal defeat, elevating ingenuity.</comment>
