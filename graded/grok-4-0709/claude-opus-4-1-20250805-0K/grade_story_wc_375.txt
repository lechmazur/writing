<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied contradictions between memory's safety and creative risk, culminating in the wall-drawing moment where impulses collide and resolve with emotional cost; motivation roots in grief and intensifies credibly without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern breaks in discoveries building to resonant reconfiguration at the cave wall, where conceptual repricing of art's nature lands with felt cost of grief; orientation anchors early in descent, and one meaningful deepening suffices without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory details in the crystal cave constrain choices and charge the final drawing image, with amethyst refractions mirroring internal transformation; micro-setting of stone and charcoal integrates action without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncorking creativity escalates through accumulative deepenings like the painting discovery, narrowing options with emotional cost legible in the chest-cracking understanding; one tightening forces stance crystallization without coincidence resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory versus imagination emerges organically from cave images and motifs, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the final drawing that reweights prior grief without moralizing; subtext in silence and implication enriches ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature in charcoal-tinged observations; rhythmic prose modulates under pressure, with purposeful compression in reflective beats taught early and paid off at closure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, no loops or scaffold; metaphors like "geode's heart" enhance without muddle, and final lines recharge motifs cleanly in the dawn aurora image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief and art through cave-locked creativity, transforming sibling trope with specific crystal harmonics; risk in lyric accumulations heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the lock's symbolic release.</comment>
