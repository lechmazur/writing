<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mari's motivation as an administrative ghost is clear and intensifies through her interactions with the container's annotations, compelling her to add her own layer in a moment of resonant affiliation. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with emotions like rage compressed into the poison label revealing contradictory impulses between dissolution and testimony. The single-POV focus excels in showing her flaws and micro-choices, such as visiting at high tide, which foreclose paths with felt costs of isolation. The final signing of names earns a meaningful endurance, charging her stasis without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned echoes of tides and annotations, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where Mari reweights erased histories by signing, with undeniable conceptual cost in her permanent dissolution. Orientation anchors early in the harbor setting by ~50 words, serving the lyric maze navigation. Closure lands on-page with the tide turning and her compass-like label, reconfiguring options; one meaningful deepening via the fresh annotation shapes tactics. Persistent constraint of tidal rhythms elevates the final image without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The shipping container labyrinth is vividly specific, with rust-streaked surfaces and echo patterns constraining Mari's navigation and charging the final groan of metal voices. Sensory details like dawn light and lapping water are purposeful, filtered through her ghost-like POV, mirroring her dissolved state. The micro-setting of Container 47-B directly shapes choices, such as high-tide visits, and evolves causally with annotations. Environment pressures the closure by harmonizing with nameless testimonies, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of testifying to non-existence escalates through density of layered stories, with a meaningful cadence shift in the spring tide annotation forcing stance crystallization. Agency in adding her observation forecloses isolation with felt cost of embracing erasure. Pressure coheres but lacks a second intensification, slightly limiting escalation; the fresh ink moment reweights stakes effectively. Cost is legible in her body's insistence versus legal death, though not maximally visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of erased histories emerges organically from annotations and Mari's death certificate, resisting tidy morals through ambiguity in signatures of the forgotten. Subtext in overheard pauses and texture of memories invites reflection on bureaucratic dissolution without confusion. The final image of groaning containers offers a resonant, non-literal answer to existing between names, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality, built from particulars like the poison label.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in sound navigation and memory textures biasing notice; elision of direct dialogue fits the ghost theme, teaching isolation early. Prose texture is distinct, with rhythmic sentences modulating like tides, voice-motivated without head-hopping. Overheard voices carry subtext naturally, advancing accumulation. Rhythmic control under pressure, as in the wet ink moment, pays off patterned diction legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and theme without loops or scaffold; e.g., "metal cliffs" opener anchors vividly. Rhythm varies naturally, syntactic variety supports tidal cadence, free of artifacts or muddled figures. Information propulsion shines in integrated details like the label's weave, with zero redundancy touching closure. Figurative language, like watercolor bleeding, is coherent and purposeful, elevating the final harmonizing voices.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise of administrative ghosts collecting in a tidal container synthesizes fresh angles on identity erasure, feeling inevitable through motifs like annotations. Risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes of death and memory via specific filters. Emotional specificity in unraveling words avoids generics, with the congregation discovery a non-obvious inflection. Bold commitment to premise charges the closure without hedging.</comment>
