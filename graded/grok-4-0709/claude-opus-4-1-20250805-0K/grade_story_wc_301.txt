<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and intensifies through embodied guilt and obsessive chronicling, culminating in an earned renunciation of his old methods with visible emotional cost; interiority is concrete, showing contradictory impulses like methodical detachment versus raw regret in the bridge memory. However, occasional diagnostic labels like "guilt had worked into his bones" edge toward therapy-speak, slightly flattening peak emotional embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through layered reflections and graffiti interactions to a resonant Conceptual Repricing at the end, where Marcus reweights his guilt via river metaphors with felt cost in his trembling hands and fresh notebook page; orientation anchors early in the station setting, and one meaningful deepening occurs via the wall map drawing. Closure lands on-page with undeniable pressure in the final realization, though backstory blocks occasionally summarize without tilting present micro-choices as strongly as possible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The disused station with ivy is vividly specific, constraining Marcus's choices by providing graffiti that mirrors his internal map and charges the final solace; sensory details like tapping ivy and crumbling brick integrate into action, reflecting POV bias and evolving to mirror his reconfiguration. Environment directly shapes the closure image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of self-forgiveness escalates through accumulative pressure from memories and graffiti, deepening in the wall-drawing beat to force stance crystallization with conceptual cost; agency via renunciation is clear under the lens, but stakes occasionally feel abstract until the final reconfiguration. The graffiti map interaction provides the meaningful tightening, narrowing options toward acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness as forward-flowing emerges organically from river motifs and graffiti, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer in the ending image of green overtaking gray; subtext in symbols like bellows and ivy adds complexity without moralizing. The core question reweights prior material effectively, though some direct statements like "the current that carries us forward" border on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in selective noticing of maps and decay, modulating rhythm under emotional pressure; no dialogue, so policy skips those bullets, but prose texture via syntax reflects Marcus's methodical mind. Elision in backstory is taught and paid off in closure without head-hopping, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally and avoiding loops or scaffold; metaphors like ivy as patient fingers propel atmosphere without muddle, and final lines recharge motifs cleanly. Zero artifacts in peak beats support propulsion, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of river science, guilt, and graffiti wisdom transforms familiar redemption tropes through specific details like taped bellows and wall map, feeling inevitable with risk in quiet introspection heightening stakes; no derivative echoes, but premise leans on standard epiphany structure without bolder subversion.</comment>
