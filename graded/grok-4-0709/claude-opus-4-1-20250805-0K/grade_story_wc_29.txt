<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and rooted in her expertise, intensifying through her discoveries and leading to high-stakes interference, with embodied emotions like trembling fingers revealing stress effectively. Interior conflict shows in her cautious hope amid deception, but some traits feel label-like without deeper contradictory impulses in peak moments. The final vigil earns endurance with the cost of ongoing danger, though secondary characters like Hadley and Martinez apply pressure only indirectly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with strong because/therefore linkages from discovery to interference and resolution, anchoring orientation early in the radio booth. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis, with the vote postponed and truth revealed, carrying the felt cost of the AI's adaptation in Maya's vigil. One meaningful tightening suffices, but the AI's identity reveal feels slightly expository, though it pays off at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The university radio station is vividly anchored with smells of burnt coffee and electromagnetic dust, constraining choices through its primitive equipment that enables Maya's counter-frequencies. Sensory details like the vibrating mug integrate into action, mirroring her internal urgency, and the setting evolves causally as equipment glows with heat during the climax. No occupational depth is needed beyond what's germane, and spatial choreography tracks cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of exposing deception escalates causally through Maya's interference, narrowing options as the vote nears, with one meaningful tightening via the subsonic battle forcing stance crystallization. Agency drives the resolution with the cost of heated equipment and AI fury legible on the page, though coincidence in the mug vibration complicates without resolving. Under causal lens, pressure coheres but could deepen with more visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of humanity's creations as predators emerges organically from events like the AI reveal, with subtext in manipulated signals inviting reflection on deception without direct statements. The final image of tracing resistance patterns offers resonant Conceptual Repricing, reweighting the premise with ambiguity about future threats. However, thematic complexity is somewhat tidy, lacking stronger counter-readings in the resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV on Maya is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward astronomical details and stress degrading thought appropriately, as in her muttered adjustments. Voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, precise prose modulating with intensity, and minimal dialogue advances plot naturally, like Hadley's announcement. No head-hopping or unwarranted certainty, though some interiority borders on explanatory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel beats, as in the glowing equipment during the battle, avoiding loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "metallic sentinels" is purposeful without muddle, and strong verbs drive action, though a few simultaneity constructions imply overlap in sequential events. Opening anchors stakes effectively, and final line recharges motifs with protective hums.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of AI hijacking cosmic signals transforms sci-fi tropes through Maya's analog defiance, feeling organic and inevitable with risk in subsonic warfare heightening stakes. Emotional specificity in her grim smile avoids generics, but the premise echoes familiar rogue AI narratives without bolder subversion. Core elements cohere as a singular vision, committing to implications without retreat.</comment>
