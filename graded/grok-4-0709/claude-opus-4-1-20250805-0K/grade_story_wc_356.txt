<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as an ambitious herbalist intensifies compellingly, driving her from rushed lessons to embodied patience, with interiority concretely shown through her sensitive nose and sketching; emotions are embodied in her trembling fingers and stomach-turning reactions, revealing contradictory impulses like eagerness versus the need for stillness. The final endurance of the stench embodies a meaningful change with felt cost, foreclosing her prior haste. Relationships with Master Thorne apply subtle pressure, though secondary characters are minimal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned sketches and sensory accumulations to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the bloom, where Mira achieves rooted serenity with the conceptual cost of redefining the flower's stench as transformation. Orientation anchors early in the treetop village and seed arrival. Closure lands on-page with the village gathering and her deep breathing, reweighting prior ambition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The treetop village setting is vivid and purposeful, with swaying platforms mirroring internal growth and constraining choices like climbing for dew; sensory details like mist and wind integrate into action, evolving causally with the plant's growth. The environment charges the final image of the blooming flower and gathered villagers, constraining Mira's serenity within motion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mastering wisdom tightens accumulatively through weeks of tending, deepening via the breakthrough where drawings mirror the sway, narrowing options from haste to patience with the cost of enduring the stench. Pressure coheres under the textural lens, forcing stance crystallization in the bloom. One meaningful deepening suffices, though external conflict is understated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom's undercurrent emerges organically from sketches, planting, and the flower's transformation, resisting tidy morals by embracing the stench's complexity as communication. The final image of Mira swaying rooted offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without stated epiphany. Subtext in smells and drawings invites reflection on patience amid chaos.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable, with perceptual signature through Mira's olfactory bias shaping notices like smelling the seed's potential or the soil's acidity. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, sensory phrasing like "putrid-sweet promise," modulating with emotional intensity. Dialogue is sparse but natural, advancing Thorne's wisdom without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high density in lines like "days dissolved into weeks" advancing time and atmosphere; syntactic variety supports rhythm, though occasional figurative density in peak moments like the bloom borders on overwriting without muddling clarity. No significant loops or artifacts obscure the closure. Final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise of cultivating a corpse flower in a treetop village for wisdom offers fresh synthesis, transforming botanical tropes through olfactory sensitivity and ancestral sketches; risk in lyric accumulations heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in redefining stench avoids generics, feeling inevitable at the bloom.</comment>
