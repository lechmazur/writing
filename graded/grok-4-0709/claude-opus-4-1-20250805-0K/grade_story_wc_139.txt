<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's characterization shines with concrete interiority rooted in her honesty contrasting her father's deception, embodied in her precise embalming actions amid emotional turmoil; contradictory impulses drive her to acknowledge debts while preserving love, culminating in an earned final calculation where "everything" remains, with visible cost in her stitching and subtraction of sins.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through layered revelations and mathematical motifs, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final image of calculated remainder with felt emotional cost; orientation anchors early in the prep room, but minor redundancy in reflective blocks slightly dilutes propulsion without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room is vividly specific, with chemical-sweet air and tools constraining Maya's embalming choices, charging the atmosphere of "deathly vitality" that mirrors thematic transformation; this micro-setting directly shapes the confrontation and charges the final image of the dead man between them.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><grade>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of fair trade escalates through deepening revelations of thefts and ashes, forcing stance crystallization with legible cost in Wei's trembling hands and Maya's subtracted love; one meaningful deepening suffices, driven by agency, though coincidence of Wei's arrival complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of honesty reckoning with deception emerges organically from particulars like the ink pot's ashes and apology letters, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer that reweights debts as acknowledgments; subtext in gestures and silences enriches complexity without tidy morals, inviting lingering ambiguity in the "surprisingly simple" everything.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person POV maintains perceptual signature through Maya's precise, honest lens, with rhythmic control in metaphors like liquid mercury; dialogue carries subtext and advances revelations naturally, distinguishing voices without convergence; no elisions or head-hopping obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with purposeful rhythm and vivid images, advancing atmosphere through lines like "humming with deathly vitality"; minor template cadence in reflective stems (e.g., "He wanted... He said...") deducts slightly, but no loops or artifacts dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of con artistry, embalming, and inherited rage transforms tropes through specific details like ashes in the ink pot for apologies, feeling inevitable with risk-taking that heightens emotional stakes; the non-obvious angle on fair trade's mathematics elevates without gimmickry.</comment>
