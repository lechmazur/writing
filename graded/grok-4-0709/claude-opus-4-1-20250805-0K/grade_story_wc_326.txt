<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to reconnect with his digital ghost is clear and intensifies through heartbeat counting, embodying his internal conflict between physical proof of life and digital evolution; emotions are contradictory and embodied, as seen in his quickening pulse during the ink ritual, revealing values with felt cost in the final acceptance. However, interiority occasionally slips into summary, like "wisdom earned through error," which feels slightly stock rather than scene-specific. The single-POV focus excels without needing relationship dynamics, and flaws complicate choices without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images like snow, ink spirals, and heartbeat counts toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where Marcus accepts his dual existence, with conceptual cost legible in the fragmented self; orientation anchors early in the observatory dome. However, causality feels loose in places, with the ghost's emergence more poetic accumulation than motivated ellipsis, slightly softening the before/after legibility. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, but the ending's resonance could tighten further for stronger payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The opal observatory under snow is vividly specific, with sensory details like breath clouding and snow whispers filtered through Marcus's urgency, constraining choices by isolating him in cold darkness; the recurring porcelain shard functions as micro-setting, charging the final image of dual reflections. Tone tensions the ethereal dome against bureaucratic error effectively. Spatial coherence holds, and weather affects the atmosphere without overreach.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconciling physical life with digital ghost escalates texturally through accelerating heartbeats and ink patterns, culminating in a deepening realization that reweights options with conceptual cost; one meaningful cadence shift in the monitors' defragmentation narrows his stance. Pressure coheres under the lens but remains somewhat abstract, with the ghost's evolution feeling more declared than tested on-page. Agency via ritual actions drives the intensification adequately for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of dual existence between life/death and physical/digital emerges organically from images like the shard reflecting both selves and the prophetic death certificate, offering resonant ambiguity in the final solace without moralizing; subtext in silences and implications enriches complexity. The ending provides a non-literal answer by reweighting the error as evolution. Insights feel earned through ritual struggle, avoiding platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in selective notices like pulse counts and ink geometries; prose texture is distinct with rhythmic, poetic syntax modulating under pressure, as in "one hundred fifty, one hundred fifty-one." Minimal dialogue ("Show me") carries subtext and advances the ritual naturally. Patterned elision in reflections is taught early and pays off at closure without confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in heartbeat counts and cascading code; metaphors like "cupped palm holding stars" are coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle. Minor scaffold in repetitive pulse enumerations creates slight template cadence, but it serves momentum without obscuring closure. Clarity holds with strong verbs and specific details, propelling toward the resonant end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise of a digital ghost from a death certificate error offers fresh synthesis of bureaucracy and identity, transformed through specific rituals like ink patterns; risk in lyric introspection heightens thematic stakes organically. However, echoes familiar sci-fi tropes of digital afterlives without bolder subversion. Emotional specificity in the observatory solitude feels authentic and memorable.</comment>
