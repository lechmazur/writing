<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in her trait of gentle thoroughness that drives the codicil addition as a high-stakes choice balancing truth and mercy; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in her three-day steeping and the haunted euphoria at twilight. The final renunciation of simple preservation earns its cost through the locket as a burden, visible on the page. Eleanor's brief presence applies secondary pressure effectively, forcing Mara's stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and reflective density to a resonant reconfiguration in the codicil addition and handover, with conceptual cost legible in the "gift and a burden" locket; orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first sentence without debt. Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable pressure, reweighting the covenant's meaning. Persistent constraint of historical truth shapes tactics and charges the final image of women in wisteria sweetness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight is vividly specific, with wisteria perfume and amber light filtering through Mara's POV to mirror her internal state; it constrains her choice by evoking the locket photo's joy and charges the final image of darkness settling with released perfume. Sensory details evolve causally, supporting tone without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving weighted moments signals early and deepens through the codicil addition, narrowing options with the cost of burdened knowledge; under Accumulative lens, pattern break in microscopic script forces stance crystallization with legible emotional price in haunted euphoria. Agency drives the intensification via Mara's research and on-page decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of regeneration through remembering emerges organically from images like walnut-ink and wisteria, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer that reweights mercy and truth without moralizing; subtext in the locket and codicil invites reflection on flawed unions. The final image offers conceptual repricing with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in archival biases and sensory steeping; prose texture modulates rhythmically under pressure, with purposeful compression in reflections taught early and paid off at closure. Brief dialogue carries subtext and advances the handover without register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel beats; no loops or artifacts obscure clarity, and metaphors like purple waterfalls integrate action without muddle. Final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archivist's dilemma with arson revelation transforms trope of restoration into non-obvious moral calculus; risk in microscopic codicil heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable through Mara's voice.</comment>
