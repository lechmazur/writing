<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kira's motivation is clear and intensifies through her grandmother's lesson, compelling her to transform her curse into a tool, with embodied emotions like the pulsing warmth revealing contradictory isolation and purpose; the final renunciation of solitude as she becomes the fixed point earns stasis with the felt cost of her pariah status, shown in the crew's honey-like movement toward her.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned reflections and sketching to a resonant reconfiguration where Kira's map reweights time's chaos into navigable paths, with conceptual cost in her transformed isolation; orientation anchors early in the observation deck post-shutdown, and the closure lands on-page with the pulsing compass as a heartbeat, charging the final image without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The time dilation observation deck vividly constrains choices, with crystalline walls reflecting void and recycled air echoing grandmother's voice, selectively filtering through Kira's urgency to mirror her internal temporal struggle; the setting charges the final image as light leaks starlight, evolving causally to enable the crew's purposeful movement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of navigating temporal chaos tightens through sketching the station as a constellation, deepening under accumulative pressure to force stance crystallization as Kira becomes Polaris; the cost is felt in her enduring isolation, legible in the pariah's smile amid echoed silence, with agency in her decision to press the drawing driving the reconfiguration without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transforming confusion into exploration emerges organically from sketching customs and temporal stretching, with subtext in whispers and light leakage inviting reflection on home as a fixed point; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by repricing isolation as a lighthouse, embracing complexity without moralizing, as in the promise of navigation post-shutdown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Consistent third-person close POV with perceptual signature in Kira's biased noticing of warmth and echoes, modulating rhythm from reflective breaths to confident sketching; purposeful compression in folded moments teaches the pattern, paying off at closure without head-hopping, though minor filter verbs in reflections slightly dull immediacy under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with rhythmic variation, as in the pulsing compass and leaking light advancing atmosphere without loops; figurative language like "moments pulled thin like taffy" integrates purposefully without muddle, though occasional elevated diction like "temporally stretched" borders on register drift in peak beats, but propulsion remains clear through the final heartbeat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time dilation with familial navigation customs transforms sci-fi tropes through Kira's specific pariah blessing, feeling inevitable in the sketching climax; risk-taking in lyric accumulations heightens stakes by repricing the shutdown's chaos, with authenticity in the non-obvious moral that isolation becomes a lighthouse.</comment>
