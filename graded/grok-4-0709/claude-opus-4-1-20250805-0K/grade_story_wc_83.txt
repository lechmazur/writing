<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Amira's motivation is clear and rooted in grief-driven determination, intensifying through her risky scanner use to reclaim lost potential, with embodied emotions like "bleak exhilaration" showing contradictory impulses in the climax. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, as seen in her reflection on unlived moments pressing reality's membrane. Dr. Chen's secondary pressure forces a quick alliance, altering the relationship state by the end. Flaws like her single-minded hunt complicate choices without artificial balance, earning the final renunciation of safety with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, because/therefore linkages drive the plot from Amira's planned access during cooling to the data transmission, culminating in a Charged Poise closure where the awakening begins with felt costs like impending security and research destruction. Orientation anchors who (Amira), where (floating observatory), and when (cooling cycle) by the first paragraph, avoiding penalties. One meaningful tightening occurs as the alarm signals early cycle end, narrowing options and forcing the download. Minor slip in ellipsis of how she pirated lectures feels convenient but doesn't break causality at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The floating observatory setting constrains choices through elevation thinning quantum boundaries and the cooling timeframe pressuring actions, charging the final image of Earth scarred below. Sensory details are selective and POV-biased, like the geode's weight in Amira's palm and sterile light, integrated into action without stalling. Micro-setting of the scanner and geode functions as environment, guiding discovery through tactile interaction. Tone tensions the sterile tech with emotional weight, supporting theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming unused potential signals early and tightens causally when patterns clarify, forcing Amira's plea for Chen's help and narrowing options as the alarm rings. Under Causal lens, one meaningful deepening changes knowledge via scanner readings, with agency in her decision to transmit despite risks, foreclosing safety with legible cost in security's arrival. Pressure coheres and grows until Charged Poise reweights stakes. Coincidence of early cycle complicates but doesn't resolve, as protagonist action earns the outcome.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming violence-stolen potential emerges organically from events like the geode's glow and data transmission, inviting reflection through ambiguity in "pools of unused potential" without tidy morals. Subtext in Chen's hesitation and Amira's steady voice layers complexity, eliciting emotional aftereffect via the geode's hope without sentimentality. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer to loss by flooding potential back, reweighting premise with conceptual cost of disrupted science. Avoids explicit statements, embracing counter-readings like ethical risks of harnessing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased by Amira's grief, as in noticing probability clouds tied to unlived futures. Voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, purposeful syntax like "Not ghosts exactly, but the weight of unlived moments," modulating with intensity. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances plot, distinguishing characters—Amira's steady commands versus Chen's whispers—pursuing goals under pressure. No head-hopping or unwarranted certainty; elision of backstory tilts present stance via micro-choices like pressing the geode harder.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing story through vivid lines like "the geode sat heavy in Amira's palm," varying rhythm without loops, though minor template cadence in action sequences ("She nodded, adjusting...") slightly dulls propulsion. Clarity is strong, with strong verbs and specific nouns; no major artifacts obscure closure, but occasional filter verbs like "felt it then" cluster mildly in peak beats. Opening anchors stakes effectively; final line resolves with charged image. Overwriting is minimal, with metaphors coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Core premise of quantum-trapped potentials from violence offers fresh synthesis of sci-fi and grief, transforming tropes through Amira's specific Kandahar backstory and geode as hope vessel, feeling inevitable in the data-scattering climax. Risk-taking in bleak exhilaration tone heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to implications like global scars hiding pools. Avoids derivative echoes, with originality in non-obvious angle of returning rather than harnessing potential. Emotional specificity personalizes archetypes, passing transformation test.</comment>
