<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Father Marcus's motivation to illuminate assumptions through silence and loops is clear and intensifies compellingly, with his patience under time pressure revealing embodied contradictions in key micro-choices like adjusting the pedal. The possessed woman's stillness pulls movement, effectively pressuring his tactics without stock traits. Relationships as crucible shine in their rhetorical interplay, forcing the unraveling with felt cost at her gasp. Minor abstraction in interiority prevents higher band entry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly, with layered loops building to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the demon dissolves into fear, tradition, and comfort, reweighting assumptions with undeniable conceptual cost in the woman's regained clarity. Orientation anchors early in the cathedral nave, and causality accrues through patterned sound without breaks. The final image of the palette clattering charges prior motifs with visible transformation. Persistent constraint of the seventeen-minute timeframe shapes tactics effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cathedral's acoustics and dimensional anchor constrain choices, with resonances plumbed to confess tensions, directly charging the closure as stones hum with ghost loops. Sensory details like echoing whispers and indigo bleeding are selective, POV-biased, and evolve causally, mirroring Marcus's internal state. Micro-setting of the palette and pedal functions as environment, limiting and enabling the exorcism. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, enhancing atmosphere without stalling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling the possession before completion tightens through accumulative density of loops and rhetoric, culminating in a deepening that reweights certainty with the cost of examined assumptions. Agency via Marcus's deliberate footfalls and paradoxes forces stance crystallization without coincidence resolving. One meaningful cadence shift at the unraveling narrows options effectively. Cost is legible in the woman's gasp and dissolved habit, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of illuminating unexamined assumptions emerges organically from looped rhetoric and indigo doorways, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in stillness as possibility. Subtext in silence and paradoxes invites reflection, with the final image offering a resonant, non-literal repricing of certainties. Emotional aftereffect arises from concrete unraveling, avoiding sentimentality. Coherent integration with events deepens without direct statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward acoustic architecture and silence, modulating rhythm under pressure without head-hopping. Prose texture in spiraling syntax reflects Marcus's mind, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. Dialogue carries subtext and advances the exorcism, with distinct idioms in muffled admissions versus clear whispers. Minor filter verbs in peak beats are voice-motivated, avoiding dullness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose density is high, with sentences advancing atmosphere and character through vivid metaphors like teaching stone to remember sand, varying rhythm naturally. No significant loops or scaffold, though some figurative stacking in indigo descriptions borders on muddle without harming clarity. Strong verbs and specific nouns propel momentum, with clean grammar and purposeful paragraphing. Opening anchors voice; final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of exorcism via loop pedal and rhetorical stillness transforms possession tropes into a non-obvious exploration of assumptions, feeling inevitable with risk-taking in textural accumulation that heightens stakes. Emotional specificity in unraveling habits avoids generics, with bold lyric structure cohering as singular vision. Core premise offers memorable angle on silence as architecture. Proximity check clears; ingenuity elevates without gimmickry.</comment>
