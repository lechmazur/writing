<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Thorne's motivation as a long-time guardian turning revolutionary is clear and intensifies through his handling of the quill holder, revealing embodied caution and resolve; Amara's presence as a second character effectively pressures his choices via status dynamics in their dialogue. Interiority is concrete, with contradictory impulses shown in his unflinching silence amid risk. The final renunciation of safety earns stasis with felt cost in the quiet certainty of change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through layered images and patterns to a Charged Poise closure where the signal's placement reconfigures the fort's future with conceptual cost of risked freedom; orientation anchors early in the twilight fort. Causality holds via textural density, with the blackout complicating without resolving. The ending's resonant image of the gleaming holder charges prior motifs without mechanical ties.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The luminous fort at twilight is vividly anchored with selective sensory details like reflected fire and darkened courtyard, filtering through Thorne's practiced navigation; the half-painted sundial as micro-setting constrains his signal placement and charges the final image. Atmosphere supports the hushed tone, evolving causally with reigniting lamps. No white-room issues; spatial choreography tracks cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of igniting non-violent revolution tightens through the blackout's pressure and signal alignment, deepening via Amara's confirmation to crystallize their stance; under Accumulative lens, cadence shifts reweight cost as accumulated risks. Agency in Thorne's placement forecloses safety with felt price in their separation. One meaningful intensification suffices, with moral calculus between vigilance and purpose sharpening the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of quiet revolution through small rebellions emerges organically from coded angles and whispers, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the empire's consumption; subtext in gestures like Amara's sword pommel implies layered loyalties. The final image of the cradle lit offers resonant repricing without statement. Emotional aftereffect lingers via complexity in their shared purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual bias in Thorne's weathered fingers and stone knowledge; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, image-rich prose modulating with hush. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances plot, distinguishing characters via Amara's stern softness. No head-hopping; elision of violence fits taught pattern of whispers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in descriptive beats like the quill's reflections; no major loops, though some figurative stacking in opening risks muddle but pays off in motif. Strong verbs and specifics propel momentum; final line recharges the holder effectively. Minor scaffold in reflective block, but it anchors and tilts stance per BRR.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of revolution via coded sundial and quill transforms trope of uprising into textural whispers, feeling inevitable with risk heightening stakes in the blackout; authenticity coheres in singular hushed vision. No derivative echoes; bold subtlety embraces complexity without hedging. One non-obvious inflection in the cradle's conceptual ignition elevates.</comment>
