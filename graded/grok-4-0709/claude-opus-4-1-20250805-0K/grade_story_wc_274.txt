<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and rooted in her archivist oath conflicting with her duty to truth, intensifying through micro-choices like scanning biometrics despite internal blur of betrayal vs. loyalty. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions in her crystallized breath and trembling grip, showing contradictory impulses simultaneously. The final choice to initiate the cascade failure earns a meaningful change with felt cost, as she smiles with "terrible peace" while security arrives. Quick test satisfied, elevating the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under the causal lens, the structure flows with because/therefore linkages from letter arrival to upload and thaw, culminating in a decisive change where truths are released with on-page cost of Vera's impending capture. Orientation anchors early in the cryogenic vault, with no disorientation debt. Closure lands via the upload completion and her resonant smile, reconfiguring options with undeniable pressure. Quick test met with persistent constraint of security timing shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The vault setting is vivid and purposeful, with frost-glazed windows and titanium floors constraining choices, like harmonics interpreted by AI. Sensory details are selective, reflecting Vera's urgency, and the echoing library under snow mirrors her internal thaw of truths. Environment charges the final image at the observation window, watching snow fall on a changing world. Quick test satisfied, though occupational depth is minimal beyond affecting her choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of releasing contraband truths vs. oath escalates causally through biometric activations and timed upload against security response, tightening options with a meaningful deepening in the cascade failure. Agency drives the intensification, foreclosing safety with visible cost in her betrayal and facing alarms. Pressure coheres under causal lens, forcing stance crystallization without coincidence resolving it. Quick test met with unmistakable on-page cost of her "terrible peace" amid change.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of deferred truths vs. power emerges organically from events like Damascus discoveries and the thawing documents, inviting reflection on history's curation without tidy morals. Subtext in the letter's fading ink and Vera's fogged breath implies disappearing truths freeing others. The final image of snow covering the old world offers a resonant, non-literal answer to provoking unspoken conversations. Quick test satisfied, though some abstraction in "unspoken conversation" slightly dilutes resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Vera's biased noticing of frost and harmonics, modulating rhythm under pressure like short sentences during activation. Prose texture is distinct, with purposeful syntax evoking frozen time, and no dialogue to evaluate. Elision in reflections is taught early and pays off at closure without obscurity. Quick test met with rhythmic control and no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through images like "breath crystallized" without loops or scaffold, though occasional figurative stacking like "ice crystals through bedrock" borders on muddle in low-pressure beats. Rhythm varies naturally, with strong verbs and specific details propelling to closure. Final line recharges motifs effectively, but minor register drift in "quantum-locked passages" feels slightly elevated for POV. Quick test satisfied with zero artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise of a cryogenic archivist awakening dormant networks for contraband truths offers a fresh synthesis of surveillance-era stakes and ancient scandals, transformed through Vera's specific conflict. Risk-taking in the quiet, dizzying tone heightens ambiguity without gimmickry, feeling inevitable at the thaw. No close echoes of famous scenes, but transformation of trope-like hidden truths is strong yet not wholly non-obvious. Quick test met with bold commitment elevating stakes.</comment>
