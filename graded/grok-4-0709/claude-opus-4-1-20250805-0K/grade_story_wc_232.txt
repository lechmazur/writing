<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and intensifies through his intuitive gift and grandfather's promise, compelling the choice to follow; interiority is concrete with embodied regret over unlived paths, showing contradictory impulses in the cavern scene. The final renunciation of his anchored life earns stasis with visible cost of foreclosed options. Strength in micro-choices revealing values, like pressing the chip to reveal choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, patterns of ants, creek, and maps build density to a cadence shift at the doorway, reweighting stakes with conceptual cost; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise, with legible before/after in his transformed self-view. Orientation anchors early in the shop; persistent promise constraint shapes tactics to the resonant ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful details like the blooming cavern's impossible light and crystalline pools charge the final image, constraining choices through topology over geography; sensory hierarchy reflects Marcus's bias, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. The micro-setting of the chip and ants integrates into action, evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of fulfilling the lingering promise tightens via the creek's rise and ants' path, deepening in the cavern to force stance crystallization under Accumulative lens; agency in stepping through forecloses passivity with felt cost of unlived lives. One meaningful intensification suffices, with moral calculus between regret and purpose sharpening the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of promises as journeys emerges organically from images like ants and maps, culminating in a resonant, non-literal final image that reweights unlived choices without moralizing; subtext in gestures and implications invites reflection on topology of decisions. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality, with complexity in ambiguity of the unchanged-yet-changed cavern.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature biased toward cartographic intuition; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, purposeful syntax that modulates with emotional intensity. No dialogue, but free indirect style clean; elision of some paths taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with vivid, concise prose advancing atmosphere and character; rhythmic variety passes read-aloud test, free of loops or scaffold, as in the cavern's blooming light description. Figurative language purposeful without muddle, like "promise sharp as broken glass," propelling to the charged final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography, ants, and topological promises transforms self-discovery trope through specific intuitive gift and cavern reconfiguration; risk in lyric ambiguity heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise non-obvious, committing to implications with authentic vision.</comment>
