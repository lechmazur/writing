<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to uncover and testify truth is clear and intensifies through discoveries, rooted in inherited curse and journals, compelling his hovering escape and confession; interiority is concrete via embodied hovering and hush-chasing, with emotions contradictory in peaceful horror revelation. Flaws like isolation drive mistakes in prolonged inaction, but resolution accepts their cost in Earned Stasis. The final testimony reclaims names with visible conceptual cost, foreclosing lies. Voice distinction is N/A as single-POV without dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds density through revelations from journals to bones to visions, culminating in Charged Poise closure where testimony transforms lattice, reweighting stakes with conceptual cost of reclaimed truth; orientation anchors early in lighthouse prison on reef. Causality holds via motivated discoveries without breaks, with one meaningful deepening at lattice pulsing. Final image of hovering in copper light charges reconfiguration legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting of lighthouse prison on Devil's Tooth Reef is vivid and purposeful, with salt air, scuffed door, and lattice constraining choices like hovering escape; sensory details like copper light and maze shadows reflect urgency and POV bias. Environment evolves causally, mirroring internal truth-emergence, and recurring lattice object charges final image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, with reef isolation pressuring isolation and revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of revealing truth tightens via journal discovery and bone find, deepening to force testimony before boat arrival, under Accumulative/Textural lens; one meaningful cadence shift at lattice confession crystallizes stance with felt cost of lifelong curse. Pressure coheres, narrowing options as door creaks open. Agency in hovering and speaking forecloses deception path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of truth in deception emerges organically from events like wolf lie twist and confession, with subtext in hush pauses and lattice maze; final image offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting premise without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers in peaceful horror ambiguity. No overt symbolism, but particulars like hovering impossibility enrich complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in impossibility-defying hover and hush obsession; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, image-rich syntax modulating with revelations. No dialogue, so N/A there. Patterned elision in visions is taught and pays off at closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and revelations; rhythm varies naturally, as in "copper light held everything in amber repose." Minor scaffold in repetitive light descriptions, but no loops or artifacts dull closure. Strong verbs and specific details propel without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of boy-who-cried-wolf legacy with hovering impossibility and ritual truth-reveal feels inevitable, transforming tropes through grounded lighthouse curse; risk in lyric accumulative style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on deception's inheritance. Emotional specificity avoids generics.</comment>
