<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and rooted in his ghost-seeing ability from the '09 accident, intensifying through discoveries that compel him to confront corruption; interiority is concrete and embodied, as in his careful analysis of dust patterns revealing character under pressure. A meaningful endurance is earned, foreclosing silence with the felt cost of carrying the "weightless burden." However, internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in key scenes, trending toward tidy rationality rather than embodied hypocrisy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, because/therefore linkages drive the plot from dust analysis to journal discovery to ceiling revelation, narrowing options toward truth exposure; closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis, with the ghosts fading and building settling into peace, carrying a felt conceptual cost in the "weightless burden." Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first paragraph without debt. The final winding of the mainspring recharges the pattern with promise, but one minor ellipsis in ghost materialization feels slightly unmotivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is vividly specific, with dust motes and cracked window filtering through Marcus's observant POV, constraining choices like prying the floorboard; sensory details evolve causally, mirroring internal guilt via dust patterns that charge the discovery beat. The micro-setting of the counter and ceiling directly shapes the climax by hiding journals, charging the final image. No white-room issues; details integrate into action without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Causal lens, the dominant stake of uncovering corruption escalates through meaningful tightening from dust analysis to ceiling journals, narrowing options and raising the cost of silence; one reversal deepens knowledge, forcing stance crystallization on exposing the truth with visible price in the ghosts' vigil ending. Agency drives resolution via Marcus's decisions, but coincidence in ghost pointing slightly complicates without fully resolving. Stakes feel visceral, though moral calculus could sharpen competing goods more explicitly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of hidden corruption and fixing broken things emerges organically from events like journal discoveries, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in guilt's weight; subtext in ghosts' routines and the mainspring's whisper offers resonant reconfiguration without statement. The final image of winding the barrel provides a non-literal answer, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. Emotional aftereffect lingers through honest darkness, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in mechanical observations like cables singing, modulating rhythm under pressure; prose texture is distinct, with purposeful syntax varying for emphasis. Brief dialogue is natural and subtextual, as in "You weren't selling tickets," advancing plot via implication. No head-hopping or register mismatch; elision in ghost appearances is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing through vivid images like "dust motes spiral" without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in discoveries with strong verbs. Minor artifact in one simile ("yellow as old teeth") feels slightly stock but doesn't obscure closure. Final line resolves with resonant image, propelling to charged poise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes ghost-seeing repairman with corruption web in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming tropes through specific details like the mainspring's whisper and dust maps; risk in quiet, accumulative revelations heightens stakes organically. Emotional specificity in guilt's burden feels authentic, but proximity to familiar ghost-resolution arcs limits boldness without full subversion.</comment>
