<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sarah's prosopagnosia and methodical artistry create concrete interior contradictions, embodied in her tactile mapping and trembling hand during the final portrait, compelling her to unify victims' dualities into a killer's profile with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through patterned drawings to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the killer's motive reweights the murders as reunions, with conceptual cost in fractured humanity; orientation anchors early in the quarry descent, but minor ellipsis in evidence theft slightly softens causality without harming the resonant end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The misty quarry setting constrains Sarah's methodical process, its textures informing her drawings and charging the final composite circle, where mist lifting reveals deeper corners mirroring her insight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering hidden dualities tightens accumulatively through portraits, culminating in agency-driven realization that narrows options to the psychiatric lead, with felt conceptual cost in embracing fragmentation; one meaningful deepening suffices, though stakes remain more internal than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of duality and fragmented wholeness emerges organically from portraits revealing contradictions, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights victims as divided selves without moralizing; the ribbon's reprise subtly charges ambiguity in empathy's dangers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person POV maintains perceptual signature through texture-focused noticing, with rhythmic prose modulating under insight's pressure; brief dialogue feels natural and advances the call to action, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, purposeful imagery like "generous hands emerging from clenched fists," varying rhythm without loops; minor figurative density in peak beats slightly muddles but doesn't obscure closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of face-blind detective using portraits to map psychological dualities transforms crime trope, with risk in textural buildup heightening thematic stakes; the composite circle feels inevitable, avoiding derivative echoes.</comment>
