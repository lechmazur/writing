<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vera's motivation to prove her theory is clear and rooted in traits like determination, intensifying through her interaction with the prism to compel the climactic realization; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like trembling hands and breath catching, showing contradictory impulses of isolation and hope acting in the revelation scene. However, some label-speak in "decades of determination, isolation, and fierce hope" trends toward diagnostic self-awareness, slightly undercutting embodiment at the peak. The final renunciation of doubt is earned by prior observations, foreclosing skepticism with the felt cost of past outcast status visible in her triumph.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered revelations and pattern shifts, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where assumptions shatter, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost of rewriting fields; orientation anchors early in the quartz arbor mist, with one continuous scene fitting scope. Closure lands on-page with the prism absorbing her triumph, making before/after legible via proof photographs. Strength in persistent emotional archaeology constraining tactics, but minor redundancy in mist descriptions slightly dilutes density buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The quartz arbor in mist is vividly anchored early, with sensory details like humming pillars and crystallizing breath purposeful and filtered through Vera's mystic bias; environment constrains choice by deepening the hush for communion, charging the final image as mist lifts and frost fades. Micro-setting of the prism as object evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Tone supports the mystical theme, with weather affecting the revelation's urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving emotions in objects signals early and deepens via prism interaction, with one meaningful intensification as frost patterns emerge, narrowing options to document before melting; under Accumulative/Textural lens, cadence shift reweights stake with felt cost of isolation paid in triumph. Agency in angling the prism drives escalation, forcing stance crystallization. Coherent pressure from family history and skepticism builds to earned revelation without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of fluid mind-matter boundaries emerges organically from prism revelations and frost patterns, inviting reflection on science vs. spirit through ambiguity in "truthful lies"; subtext in emotional signatures avoids direct statements, with final image offering resonant non-literal answer by repricing assumptions without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect arises from concrete particulars like grandmother's tears, embracing complexity. Strength in thematic resonance charging the closure, but minor abstraction in "emotional archaeology" slightly tempers organic emergence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable and close, with perceptual signature biased toward mystic observations like "emotional wavelengths"; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, lyric diction fitting accumulative lens, modulating with intensity in refracted images. Minimal dialogue ("Show me") is natural and goal-driven, advancing communion. No head-hopping or register drift, with purposeful compression in pattern descriptions taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and revelation through vivid images like "crystallized breath"; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops, though minor template cadence in mist descriptions ("mist began lifting... last wisps of mist dissolved") slightly dulls propulsion. No artifacts obscure closure, with strong verbs and specific detail propelling to the final line. Figurative language integrates without muddle, supporting momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Premise of emotion-absorbing objects offers fresh synthesis via frost as emotional lexicon, transforming mystic trope through specific prism history and family signatures; risk in lyric accumulative style heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight. However, echoes familiar pseudoscience narratives without bold subversion, limiting ingenuity. Details particular to voice, but core frame borders derivative without non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>
