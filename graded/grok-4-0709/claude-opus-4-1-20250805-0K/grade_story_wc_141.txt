<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's motivation as a myth buster intensifies convincingly from investigation to emotional participation, with embodied contradictions in her humming and final nod revealing a hierarchy of values; Claudia's bittersweet presence pressures this shift effectively as a crucible relationship; the closure choice feels earned with visible cost to her professional identity, though interiority occasionally leans on stock phrasing like "suspected something more complex."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure accumulates resonant discoveries from shell to cello to voices, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Marina reweights myths as preservable with emotional cost in her own conversations rising; orientation anchors early at the observatory; one meaningful deepening suffices, but the daughter’s emergence feels slightly coincidental without stronger setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned observatory on Sorrow's Cliff constrains choices through its decayed state and wind-rustled papers, charging the final image of waves crashing as a rhythmic echo of rewritten conversations; sensory details like dust motes and salt spray are selective and POV-filtered, mirroring Marina's investigative bias; the cello as micro-setting evolves causally, heightening atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of busting vs. preserving the myth tightens through the cello's resonant response and Claudia's explanation, deepening to a charged poise where Marina's stance crystallizes with felt emotional cost; under Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern of accumulating voices reweights options effectively; one meaningful intensification suffices, though coincidence of Claudia's appearance slightly undercuts agency-driven escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of navigating regret through reimagined conversations emerges organically from particulars like the shell's hum and cello's voices, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer at the ending where Marina joins the chorus; subtext in unfinished cello and bittersweet smile invites reflection on human longing without tidy morals; emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Marina's humming and investigative bias; voice texture distinct through rhythmic prose modulating with discoveries; dialogue carries subtext and advances plot naturally, distinguishing characters like Claudia's "cheerfully gloomy" idiom; no head-hopping or unwarranted certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like "dust motes danced through gaps" advancing atmosphere; no significant loops or artifacts, though occasional simile stacks like "pale as driftwood" border overwriting without muddling clarity; final line resolves with resonant image, propulsion strong under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of myth-busting with emotional resonances transforms tropes of haunted artifacts into a non-obvious exploration of regret; risk in blending science and music heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the cello's activation; authenticity coheres without gimmickry, though premise echoes familiar ghost-story angles.</comment>
