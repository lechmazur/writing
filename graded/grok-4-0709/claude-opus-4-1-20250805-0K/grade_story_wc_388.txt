<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation as a debunker intensifies compellingly, leading to contradictory impulses in the climax where he chooses preservation over exposure, with embodied emotion shown through his digging and intuition; the final renunciation forecloses his debunking path with visible cost as he walks into the wasteland.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure builds through because/therefore linkages from discovery to reconstruction to decision, with orientation anchored early in the orchard; closure lands as an Earned Stasis with felt cost in the final walk, though one ellipsis in the tent slightly softens mid-story causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard setting is vivid and purposeful, with glowing fruit and dust storms constraining Marcus's choices and charging the final image of untouched trees; sensory details like the Geiger counter's clicks and soil under hands integrate into action, mirroring his internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, conflict escalates through discoveries narrowing options, culminating in the ethical stake of exposure versus preservation; one meaningful tightening occurs at the diamond's unearthing, forcing a trade-off with legible cost in leaving the stillpoint, though stakes remain somewhat internal without external antagonism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of truth's complexity versus protective lies emerges organically from events like letter reconstruction and the final burial, with subtext in the diamond's flaw mirroring human choices; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing, inviting reflection on conspiracies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-specific, with perceptual signature in sharply observant details like ink patterns; prose texture modulates rhythmically under pressure, as in the howling wind during reconstruction, with no dialogue to evaluate but clean free indirect style.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the storm's approach, advancing atmosphere without loops; minor figurative muddle in "crack in reality" slightly clutters the peak dig, but overall propulsion is strong with clean grammar and purposeful syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise ingeniously transforms post-apocalyptic tropes with the radiation-neutralizing diamond and ethical conspiracy, feeling organic through Marcus's arc; risk in the quiet, ambiguous closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though familiarity in wasteland motifs caps ingenuity slightly.</comment>
