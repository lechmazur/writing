<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in his own loss and embodied as a stone-like weight on his chest, driving his symphony with mournful eagerness. Interiority is concrete and particular, showing contradictory impulses in his half-dance, half-prayer conducting. The family's grief is somewhat stock, but their reactions under pressure reveal authentic emotional layering without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through the blower symphony's escalating notes and echoes, leading to a resonant reconfiguration where laughter returns with conceptual cost of ongoing hauntings. Orientation anchors early at the tunnel entrance with Marcus and blowers. Closure lands on-page with the final exhale and Marcus's lighter walk, reweighting joy's persistence; the supernatural sustain charges the ending image effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel is vividly specific, with curved walls multiplying sounds and ventilation shafts carrying wind upward, constraining Marcus's choices and charging the final image of exhaled laughter. Sensory details like gleaming pull cords and limestone pores integrate into action, reflecting POV bias. The setting pressures the symphony's mechanics, making it indispensable to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring lost laughter tightens through the performance's swelling chorus under Accumulative lens, with one meaningful deepening as echoes reach the family, narrowing options to persistence. Cost is legible in Marcus's ongoing duty and the family's swallowed laughs, charging the final image. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolving it, though internal conflict could interweave more externally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of joy's enduring echoes emerges organically from the tunnel's mechanics and Bobby's secret, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in necessary hauntings. The final image of clinking pull cords offers a resonant, non-literal answer to grief's permanence, reweighting the premise without statement. Subtext in gestures like conducting movements deepens complexity authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV on Marcus is stable, with perceptual signature in sound-focused noticing and rhythmic prose modulating with intensity, like the supernatural sustain. Voice texture is distinct, with purposeful lyric compression in lullaby fragments taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; elision of mechanics enhances mystery without confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like dust motes dancing as shadow puppets, though some metaphors stack in the climax without muddle. Rhythm varies naturally, but occasional synonym loops like "mournfully eager" repeat without payoff. No major artifacts obscure closure, and final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of leaf blowers as a symphony for recalling echoes transforms familiar grief tropes into a fresh magical realism angle, feeling inevitable with the tunnel's purpose. Risk-taking in the mechanical choir heightens stakes organically, committing to the premise without gimmickry. The core concept of necessary hauntings offers non-obvious emotional truth through specific details like the thirteen-second sustain.</comment>
