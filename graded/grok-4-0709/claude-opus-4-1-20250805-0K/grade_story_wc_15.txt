<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Calla's motivation as a former poet turned weaver is clear and intensifies through her sleepwalking and sewing, compelling her to stitch myths with felt cost in the lost world; interiority is concrete and embodied in phantom stitches and optimism from barren ground, showing contradictory impulses like haunting hope amid ruin without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned overlaps in sleepwalking paths, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final image of dancing children on walls with conceptual cost of embracing transformation over restoration; orientation anchors early in the wharf weaver's trance at dawn in the canyon; closure lands on-page with charged poise as she smiles into drowsiness, reweighting the premise of broken precedents.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The labyrinth setting is vivid and purposeful, with tidal sanctuary details like barnacles on petroglyphs constraining Calla's choices and charging the final image of children dancing on canyon walls; sensory hierarchy reflects her bias, integrating into action as paths overlap like threads; environment evolves with tides, mirroring internal hope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of weaving from ruin escalates texturally through pattern breaks in overlapping paths and sewing invisible stitches, tightening to a deepening that reweights options with cost of non-restoration; agency in her renunciation of the old world forecloses paths with felt optimism's price in barren ground, coherent under Accumulative lens without requiring reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of transformation over restoration emerges organically from images like bleeding watercolors and nautilus spirals, inviting reflection through ambiguity in haunting optimism; final image offers resonant, non-literal answer by repricing broken precedents as bridges, avoiding moralizing; subtext in gestures like clutching the plate deepens complexity without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature in selective noticing of threads and tides biased by her poet-weaver mind; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, lyric syntax that modulates with emotional intensity, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure; no dialogue, but internal voice coherent and specific under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "dried blood and hope" without loops or scaffold; rhythmic variety supports momentum, though some figurative stacking in peak beats like sewing air slightly muddles without harming clarity; final line resolves by recharging motifs with "orchid solace," propelling to charged ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing post-flood labyrinth with sleepwalking weaving, transforming tropes of apocalypse into non-obvious hope via nautilus overlaps; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable as the illustration plate's children become petroglyphs; fresh angle avoids generics, committing to premise without hedging.</comment>
