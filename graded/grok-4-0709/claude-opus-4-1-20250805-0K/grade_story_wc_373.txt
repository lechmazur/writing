<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mae's motivation is clear and intensifies through her infiltration attempts, rooted in her father's legacy, with embodied emotions like racing pulse under pressure; the watch fob reveals internal conflict effectively. The woman's presence applies secondary pressure, forcing micro-choices that alter tactics. Minor slip in stock heirloom trope, but it earns the final renunciation with felt cost of exile.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under causal lens, because/therefore linkages build from infiltration to revelation, with one meaningful tightening at the badge discovery; closure is a resonant reconfiguration via earned stasis, as Mae completes the case but forecloses return, with legible cost in the fob's changed weight. Orientation anchors early on the piling. Strong escalation to dawn, though the market's dissolution feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The pirate market under the rotting pier is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like dripping beams and candlelight constraining Mae's movements and charging the final beach image. Micro-setting of the watch fob as object-setting evolves to recharge closure. Atmosphere mirrors internal unease, guiding choices without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of thwarting the shipment escalates causally through false starts to the badge reveal, narrowing options with one meaningful tightening; cost is felt in exile and broken trust. Agency drives the climax via Mae's decision to reveal the badge. Coherent pressure crystallizes stance, though coincidence of the woman's suspicion slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of trust's fragility emerges organically from events like the fob's reveal and market's dissolution, with subtext in silences and implications; final image offers resonant, non-literal repricing of loyalty's cost without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity. Avoids sentimentality, though "some sounds were worth the breaking" borders on tidy insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in tide rhythms and market chaos; voice modulates rhythmically under stress, like short sentences at the reveal. Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot naturally, distinguishing characters. Elision of some details is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax; metaphors like "trust breaking sounded like recognition" propel without muddle. Minor scaffold in repetitive "trust breaking" phrasing, but no loops touch closure. Strong verbs and specificity advance momentum, though one mixed simile ("drowning in reverse") slightly strains.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of undercover legacy with auditory motif transforms infiltration trope through specific details like the "truce of hush"; risk in conceptual repricing heightens stakes organically. Avoids stock echoes, committing to premise's implications. Minor hedging in symmetric resolution of arrests.</comment>
