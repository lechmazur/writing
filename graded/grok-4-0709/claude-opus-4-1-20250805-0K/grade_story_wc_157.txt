<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation as a defiant entomologist is clear and intensifies through his insect releases, revealing embodied tension in his smile amid chaos; Serena's rogue traits drive cryptic dialogue that pressures their alliance. Interiority is concrete, with contradictory impulses like calm release of mantises under stress, but secondary character pressure feels slightly underdeveloped in their brief exchange. The hierarchy of values shines in Marcus's choice to handle the Auditors, foreclosing escape with felt relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure links events tightly from Serena's arrival to the Auditors' intrusion, with motivated escalation via insect interference; closure lands as Earned Stasis with Marcus standing guard, cost legible in the bursting door and implied peril. Orientation anchors early in the greenhouse hum, avoiding penalties. One meaningful tightening suffices, but the tunnel escape feels like a minor ellipsis without fuller causal payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting is vivid and purposeful, with humid gleam and wing-beats constraining choices like releasing locusts to mask as "rain," directly charging the final confrontation. Sensory details filter through Marcus's POV, mirroring internal defiance via chlorophyll and glass. Environment evolves causally, from calm documentation to cacophonous shield, meeting the 9+ test by shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving the secret language escalates causally through Auditors' arrival, tightening options with Marcus's insect releases narrowing escape; agency drives the deepening as he urges Serena to plant while he guards, with felt cost in his isolation. One meaningful pressure point suffices, but coincidence of the squad's timing slightly complicates without fully resolving. Under Causal lens, it holds with protagonist-driven trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of resistance as ecosystem emerges organically from insect wing-beats and planted patterns, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in chaos's grammar; subtext in Serena's smile and seed etchings invites reflection on commodified consciousness. Final image of locusts as "rain" offers resonant, non-literal repricing of defiance, reweighting the premise without statement. Emotional aftereffect lingers through photosynthetic rebellion, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stays stable and biased toward Marcus's entomological lens, with perceptual signature in wing symphonies; dialogue carries subtext, like Serena's cryptic recitation advancing the plot naturally. Voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, humid prose modulating with tension. Minor filter verbs in peak stress don't dull immediacy, meeting high standards without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm from hummed symphony to pounding door, advancing atmosphere without loops; metaphors like "photosynthetic rebellion" are controlled and payoff in closure. No artifacts obscure clarity, with strong verbs and specific nouns propelling beats. Final line recharges motifs ingeniously, passing the 9+ test with zero scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise ingeniously synthesizes insect neurology with linguistic resistance, transforming tropes of surveillance into garden-planted theses; risk in alien locust consciousness heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable via etched seeds. Fresh angle on defiance avoids generics, with bold ecosystem metaphor committing fully. The non-obvious warp of message grids elevates, meeting 9+ with hindsight inevitability.</comment>
