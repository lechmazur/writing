<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly from diagnosis to purposeful acceptance, with embodied emotions and contradictory impulses shown in her trembling hands amid systematic work; the tumor's role as a bridge earns the final renunciation with visible cost in her reframed death sentence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered discoveries to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Mira reframes her death as an appointment, with felt cost in her limited time; orientation anchors early in the orchard scene, though minor elision in trustee details slightly softens causality without harming the resonant ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The temple orchard's vivid, purposeful details—volcanic pillars fused with roots—constrain Mira's choices in wire-wrapping and charge the final palm-on-pillar image, with sensory hierarchy reflecting her urgency and POV bias toward electromagnetic pulses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reframing death and temple purpose tightens through the night's work, deepening understanding and narrowing options with the cost of her mortality made legible in the "appointment" realization; under Accumulative lens, one intensification suffices, driven by agency in the final connection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of interspecies respect emerges organically from wire translations and root-stone dialogues, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in the orchard's "ancient patience" invites reflection on human boundaries with purposeful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Close third-person POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Mira's focus on vibrations and frequencies; prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, purposeful syntax, teaching compression early and paying off at closure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density and propulsion with vivid metaphors like "salt spray on a windless day" advancing atmosphere and character; zero loops or artifacts, syntactic variety supports rhythm, and the final line recharges motifs cleanly under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dying translator via brain tumor frequency transforms eco-fantasy tropes into inevitable hindsight, with bold risk in interspecies council heightening stakes organically; the premise commits fully without hedging, feeling singular and authentic.</comment>
