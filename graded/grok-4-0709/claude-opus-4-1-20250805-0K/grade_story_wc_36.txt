<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kessa's motivation is clear and intensifies from failure to understanding, with embodied emotions like trembling fingers and internal contradictions shown in her shift from sealing to weaving; the final acceptance of the seed earns a meaningful change with felt cost of past guardianship. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, as seen in her desperation-driven discovery of the new song. Flaws complicate choices authentically, with her predecessors' errors mirroring her own initial misbelief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elision and density increase to a Conceptual Repricing closure where failure transforms into guardianship's true beginning, with conceptual cost legible in reweighted worlds as dance partners; orientation anchors early in the Thunder-echo range. The weave's materialization and seed offering provide a resonant final image with undeniable pressure. Minor redundancy in reflective blocks slightly dilutes propulsion but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Thunder-echo range and canyon hush are vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like avalanchingly quiet peaks pressing eardrums constraining Kessa's descent and charging the final whisper of approval; the environment evolves causally, mirroring her internal shift. Micro-setting of the thin reality spot directly enables the weaving action and closure. Details are POV-filtered and integrated into action, enhancing atmosphere without stalling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of harvesting insights from failure tightens through one meaningful deepening when the melody braids worlds, narrowing options from sealing to exchange with visible cost in accepting the seed's warmth; under Accumulative/Textural lens, cadence shift reweights the stake effectively. Pressure coheres via the Other Place's press, forcing stance crystallization. Coincidence of the figure's appearance complicates but doesn't resolve, as it's earned by her song.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of transforming failure into doorway emerges organically from weaving imagery and predecessors' errors, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the seed of light that reweights separation as partnership without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like the figure pointing to driftwood adds depth. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in metaphorical noticing, like notes as golden threads; rhythmic control heightens under pressure, as in the deepening silence. Patterned diction teaches lyric mode early and pays off at closure. No dialogue, so those bullets ignored; elision of traditional song details serves to charge the new melody's reveal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, as in the opening's held breath to final whisper; metaphors like smoke through gauze are coherent and purposeful without muddle. No loops or scaffold, high information density in lines like the flute's braiding purpose. Minor overwriting in descriptive peaks slightly reduces clarity but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of failure as weaving between worlds feels inevitable, transforming guardian trope through specific driftwood markers and seed; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on thresholds as doorways. Authenticity coheres in singular vision.</comment>
