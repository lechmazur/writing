<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to paint possibilities for her comatose daughter is clear and intensifies through embodied urgency like the borrowed heartbeat, compelling her calculated strokes despite internal conflict; interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions layered contradictorily in her calm yet thrumming chest. The final renunciation of doubt in the sparrow's song earns stasis with felt emotional cost, foreclosing despair. No second character limits relationship crucibles, but single-POV depth shines in micro-choices like encoding spirals.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and motifs like rainbows and lullabies, culminating in Charged Poise closure where the sparrow's song reconfigures possibilities with conceptual cost of persistent separation; orientation anchors early in the terrace at spring dawn. Causality is motivic rather than linear, with one meaningful deepening in the quickened heartbeat. Minor elision in Sophia's coma backstory anchors via cue without excess, tilting present stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The echoing terrace in spring is vividly specific, with rain-slicked stones and prism parapet constraining Maya's painting choices and charging the final sparrow image; sensory details like water droplets and rainbow mist are purposeful, filtered through her urgent POV. Atmosphere evolves causally from hush to stirring city, mirroring internal hope. Micro-setting of the easel and parapet pressures actions tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of waking Sophia via painted maps escalates texturally through density of motifs like coded lullabies and borrowed heartbeat, with one meaningful deepening in the jammed bells and sparrow's response that reweights hope's cost; agency in Maya's renunciation forecloses inaction with felt emotional price. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving. Moral calculus between reality and possibility sharpens the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of bending reality through art and love emerges organically from particulars like prism light and lullabies, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in Sophia's return; subtext in gestures like trembling fingers invites reflection on loss. Final image of invisible doors offers resonant, non-literal repricing of possibilities without statement. Emotional aftereffect lingers through charged hope amid cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Maya's artistic bias noticing colors and echoes; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, lyric prose modulating with urgency, like quickened brushwork. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision in backstory is taught and paid off. Syntax reflects her calm grace under stress without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "taffy" hush; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops, though occasional figurative stacking in parapet descriptions borders on muddle without harming clarity. Strong verbs and specific nouns propel momentum; final line recharges motifs cleanly. Minor scaffold in song repetition serves pattern without drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mirage painting as dream maps transforms coma trope through specific motifs like borrowed heartbeat and jammed bells, feeling inevitable; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional complexity avoids generics; premise commits fully without retreat.</comment>
