<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's motivation as an altruistic ghost is clear and intensifies through her persistent messages, compelling collective action with a felt cost in her fading; interiority is concrete, showing her two-century loneliness and hope, embodied in her bell-chiming persistence. Relationships as crucible shine in how her interventions force families to reexamine suspicions, altering their states by the end. A key strength is the micro-choice of her final message, revealing a hierarchy of values with the cost of her own dissolution. Flaws are minor, like slightly stock family portrayals, but they don't undermine the ghost's depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through message shards with legible transitions over dawns, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Marina fades and the bell materializes, reweighting unity with the conceptual cost of her eternal watch ending. Orientation anchors early with the ghost among floating arches on Pomona-7, and the pattern pays off without disorientation debt. One meaningful deepening suffices, as messages accumulate to force communal mapping and fence-tearing. The final image of the bell at the fountain charges closure with undeniable resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating rock arches constrains choices, as the blight spreads across groves and arches frame dawn messages, charging the final image where the bell lands under them. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, like the crimson sky and chalk materializing, filtered through Marina's ethereal POV with urgency narrowing to soil networks. Setting evolves causally, from deserted streets to mixed groves, mirroring internal unity. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, with arches as recurring motifs that guide collective gatherings.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of overcoming blight through unity signals early, with one meaningful deepening as families share samples, tightening pressure under the Accumulative lens to crystallize collective purpose. Agency via Marina's renunciation forecloses isolation with the felt cost of her fading. Moral calculus sharpens in tearing down fences, a trade-off between suspicion and shared immunity. Strength in the six-month shard where progress is slow but hope roots, making cost legible without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of unity from suspicion emerges organically through messages and shared efforts, culminating in a resonant final image of the bell as unity's voice, reweighting isolation's cost without moralizing. Subtext in chalk's "strangely trustworthy" implication invites reflection on invisible guidance. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality, earned by particulars like the nebula of respite redefining boundaries. The ending offers a non-literal answer to division, embracing complexity as blight persists but can't spread.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Multi-POV is stable with clear shifts at section breaks, maintaining coherence under the Accumulative lens without head-hopping; perceptual signature distinguishes Marina's ethereal view from families' grounded ones. Prose texture is distinct with rhythmic, flowing syntax modulating dawn's calm to gathering excitement. Dialogue is natural and subtextual, like Tom's question advancing plot without exposition. Elision of time between shards is patterned and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, each sentence advancing atmosphere or arc, like "black rot crept like despair made visible" doing double duty without loops. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in revelations and breathing in reflective dawns; no artifacts obscure closure. Figurative language is controlled, with metaphors like "brambled hope" consistent and voice-motivated. Final line resolves with resonant image, recharging the bell motif cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality in synthesizing ghost lore with sci-fi orchards and fungal networks, transforming isolation tropes through specific unity mechanics like cross-grove fungi. Fresh angle in the ghost's chalk messages as subtle orchestration, feeling inevitable with the bell's materialization. Risk in multi-shard structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, cohering as singular vision. Minor echo of benevolent ghost archetypes is personalized via planetary blight, avoiding derivative pitfalls.</comment>
