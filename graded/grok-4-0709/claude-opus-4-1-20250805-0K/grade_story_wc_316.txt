<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodiment of numbness through hollow voice and remembered emotions, with contradictory impulses in the sparring scene revealing values; motivation intensifies credibly to the jar-holding choice, earning the renunciation of opposition with conceptual cost; interiority avoids stock phrasing, grounding in specific sci-fi traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern of thesis-antithesis building to synthesis; closure via Conceptual Repricing in the final jar-holding image reweights selfhood with undeniable shared-loss cost; orientation anchors early in the hall with Master Chen; one meaningful deepening suffices, though causality feels more hybrid at sparring without penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful details like crystalline walls and gravity hum constrain sparring choices and charge the Earth-view rotation at closure; micro-setting of jar and swords mirrors internal split; sensory hierarchy reflects POV numbness, evolving causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaimed feeling signaled early, tightening through sparring reversal that narrows options under Textural lens; agency in picking up jar crystallizes stance with legible conceptual cost; one deepening via complementary opposites forces trade-off, though coincidence of duplicate's plan complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of multiplicity and emergent feeling arises organically from jar and sparring particulars, culminating in resonant non-literal answer at "numbness is possibility"; subtext in silence and gestures invites ambiguity without confusion; avoids moralizing, embracing complexity in shared selfhood.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent first-person POV with perceptual bias toward numbness; voice texture distinct in hollow rhythm and syntax; dialogue natural, subtext-driven, distinguishing characters via Chen's koan-like indirection; no head-hopping or unwarranted certainty, with purposeful compression in reflective blocks tilting stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm accelerating in spar; zero loops or artifacts, strong verbs and specific nouns throughout; final line recharges motifs cleanly; no overwriting, metaphors coherent like "thesis, antithesis, synthesis" serving pressure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cloning trope through complementary opposites and vivified third self, feeling inevitable via sparring; risk in conceptual ego death heightens stakes organically; avoids derivatives, committing to premise with authentic vision in floating dojo frame.</comment>
