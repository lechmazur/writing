<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and intensifies through mathematical certainty compelling his climbs and rolls, with interiority concrete in embodied regret over Sarah; contradictory impulses of grim optimism act simultaneously in his patient urgency, earning the final endurance with felt cost of missed opportunity. The chipped die reveals character under pressure, as in the roll showing a bleeding pip that adjusts his calculations. No stock phrasing mars the specificity, and flaws like measured recklessness complicate choices without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern of rolls and steps builds to Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost of eternal confinement reweighted by mathematical rupture; orientation anchors early with Marcus on the staircase, and one meaningful deepening suffices via the growing chip. Causality holds through motif accumulation, but minor redundancy in recursive descriptions slightly dilutes propulsion without breaking lens coherence. The final roll and ascent reconfigure options legibly, with cost felt in Sarah's blurred face.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The infinite staircase constrains choices vividly, with dice tumbling upward defying gravity and steps generating momentum, charging the final image of ascent; sensory details like the chipped die's texture and humming architecture are selective and POV-biased, mirroring internal perpetuity. Micro-setting of the die and equations on his arm evolves causally, guiding action without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of escaping the loop tightens through pattern breaks in dice rolls, deepening via the chip's growth that reweights probability with felt cost of lost life with Sarah; under Textural lens, one intensification suffices, driven by agency in deliberate climbs. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolving, but stakes occasionally feel abstract until the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of imperfection rupturing perfection emerges organically from dice rolls and proofs, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in mathematical prophecy; final image of grim ascent offers resonant, non-literal answer to confinement, reweighting premise without statement. Subtext in chipped die's texture captures missed opportunity's roughness, eliciting emotional aftereffect of calculated hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in mathematical filtering, like equations tattooed on his arm; prose texture in rhythmic rolls and syntax reflects focalizer's mind under stress. Mutters carry subtext naturally, advancing introspection; no head-hopping or register drift, with purposeful compression in eternal now legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere like "the pip bleeding into dimensional space"; zero loops or scaffolds, rhythmic variety in climbs and rolls propels without muddle, even in peak figurative moments. Strong verbs and specific nouns dominate, with final line recharging motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mathematical theology and perpetual prison transforms tropes through specific dice mechanics and heartbeat loop, feeling inevitable with risk in bold conceptual integrity; non-obvious angle on regret via probability heightens stakes organically. Commitment to premise avoids hedging, with emotional complexity in grim optimism memorable.</comment>
