<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies through her patient decoding, rooted in kindness and curiosity that compel her to seek hidden joys; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like misted breath and quickened pulse revealing contradictory impulses of recognition over excitement. The final renunciation of the frozen-grief myth earns its cost through prior micro-choices, such as tilting the goggles. Strength lies in her hierarchy of values shown in dusting the astrolabe weekly, never suspecting, which forecloses superficial views. No diagnostic labels mar the portrayal, but internal conflict could show more simultaneous contradiction in a peak moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through floor-by-floor revelations, with patterned elision of coordinates and messages accruing to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Thorne's departure reweights sorrow as transformation, with undeniable conceptual cost in Mira's shifted ascent purpose. Orientation anchors early with the servant in the elevator spire. The final image of smiling at the goggles charges the reconfiguration without contradiction. Persistent constraint of altitude and frost shapes tactics, elevating the score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The icebound spire and elevator shaft are vivid and purposeful, with frost-etched windows and cracking ice constraining Mira's discoveries and charging the final image of clouds no longer seeming cold. Sensory details like amber bulbs and howling wind filter through her POV, mirroring internal thawing. The setting evolves causally with altitude stealing warmth, directly affecting choices like warming the goggles to reveal ink. Micro-setting of the goggles and astrolabe functions as environment that charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><grade>Under Accumulative lens, the dominant stake of uncovering Thorne's truth deepens through pattern breaks like projected coordinates and unfolding ink, forcing stance crystallization on sorrow's transformation with legible conceptual cost in her redefined routine. One meaningful tightening suffices, as elevator lurches narrow options. Agency in decoding drives escalation, but coincidence of finding goggles complicates without resolving. Cost is unmistakable in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transforming sorrow into preserved joy emerges organically from images like scattered light and etched symbols, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer via the diary's message without stated moral. Subtext in goggles' warmth and ice lace invites reflection on tenderness surviving isolation. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars like Thorne's margin note. The ending reweights prior material, such as daily climbs, with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Mira's selective noticing of tenderness in technical notes; no dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets. Prose texture is distinct, with rhythmic syntax like floor counts building cadence. Patterned elision in shorthand is taught early and paid off at closure without head-hopping. Emotional intensity modulates voice effectively, as in quickened pulse during revelations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, each sentence advancing atmosphere or revelation, like "gears clicked like a grandfather clock counting backwards" propelling momentum without loops. Rhythm varies naturally, with syntactic variety in similes like "ice cracking from its cables like breaking bones" heightening pressure. No artifacts obscure closure; figurative language is controlled and coherent. Final line resolves by recharging goggles motif with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise of encrypted joys in an abandoned spire offers fresh synthesis, transforming discovery tropes through Mira's warmly inquisitive lens and light-scattered projections. Risk in accumulative structure heightens stakes via floor-by-floor buildup, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Emotional specificity in preserved moments like "Martha's sleeping face" avoids generics. No close echoes of famous scenes, with originality in conceptual departure over death.</comment>
