<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies through grief to compel her transformation, with embodied emotions like trembling hands and unbidden tears revealing contradictory impulses of sorrow and recognition; interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The final endurance as a living archive is earned by prior scents triggering memories, foreclosing her old life with the felt cost of perpetual grief visible in her tears. Strength lies in micro-choices, like uncorking the vial, that reveal her value hierarchy under pressure. Minor slip in over-articulated self-awareness mid-crisis slightly hedges emotional rawness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered scents and memories with density increasing toward a resonant reconfiguration, where Elara's transformation into a living archive reweights the stake of loss with conceptual cost of luminous grief; orientation anchors early in the greenhouse setting. Closure lands on-page via Conceptual Repricing in the final paragraph, with felt cost in tears as portals, and a persistent constraint of extinct scents shaping her new purpose. The pattern of spectral revelations pays off without contradiction, teaching its accumulative method early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting is vivid and purposeful, with crystal shadows and spectral roots constraining Elara's choices and charging the final image of an invisibly blooming garden; sensory details like opalescent sheen and impossible scents are filtered through her cautious POV, evolving causally with the perfume's release. Micro-setting of the vial and lantern integrates into action, mirroring her internal transformation without overt symbolism. Strength in how the environment pressures her grief, as in the vacant plots triggering recognition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding grief escalates texturally through waves of extinct scents deepening emotional pressure, forcing stance crystallization in her transformation with unmistakable cost of becoming the perfume herself; one meaningful deepening via the vial's catalyst narrows options, driven by her agency in uncorking it. Coherent pressure from memories reweights the stake without coincidence resolving it. Minor slip in abstract stakes occasionally feeling less visceral, but closure linkage is strong.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preserving lost things through grief emerges organically from scents triggering memories, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer that tears translate loss into luminosity, reweighting prior material without moralizing; subtext in phantom gardens and crystal shadows invites reflection on memory's cost. Emotional aftereffect is concrete via her transformation, embracing complexity in preservation as grief. The final image offers Conceptual Repricing, tying theme to the core concept of memories' impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in aromatic caution and light spectrums, modulating rhythm under pressure like shortening sentences during tears; prose texture in purposeful compression of memories teaches pattern early, paying off at closure without elision obscuring clarity. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; free indirect style is clean, with perceptual bias consistent. Strength in syntax reflecting her mind, as in fragmented scents evoking waves.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and character like "tears came unbidden" embodying emotion without loops; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding template cadence, though one minor paraphrase loop in memory descriptions slightly dulls momentum. Figurative language is controlled, with metaphors like crystal shadows enhancing clarity in peak beats. No artifacts touch closure, maintaining propulsion to the luminous ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing extinct flowers with lantern memories, offering a fresh angle on grief as transformation, with non-obvious synthesis feeling inevitable in her becoming the archive; risk-taking in textural structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise transforms familiar loss tropes through specific aromatic details and bold commitment to conceptual repricing. Strength in the vial's catalyst as a singular vision, avoiding derivative echoes.</comment>
