<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and rooted in dual allegiance, intensifying through her internal conflict and micro-choices like touching the stone chip, which reveals embodied emotion under pressure; the final renunciation of direct resistance for clever reorganization earns a meaningful change with felt cost. Interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing, though secondary characters are minimally present without deep status dynamics. The stone chip's recurring touch effectively shows contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The structure follows a hybrid lens (causal dominant at closure) with clear because/therefore linkages from graffiti warnings to the developers' arrival and Maya's plan, culminating in an on-page resonant reconfiguration where the community incorporates with visible cost in "hopeful desperation." Orientation anchors early in the raft city setting by ~50 words. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length, though ellipsis between gathering and blooming murals is motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The raft city and perpetual carnival are vividly specific, with sensory details like lights on black water and wave generators filtering through Maya's POV, constraining choices like meeting behind the Ferris wheel; the environment charges the final image of floating free, meeting the 9+ test. Details evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of community preservation tightens meaningfully under hybrid lens when developers arrive, forcing Maya's stance crystallization in the gathering announcement, with felt cost in her dual allegiance pull; one deepening suffices, though coincidence of graffiti timing complicates without resolving. Agency drives the reorganization, narrowing options with ethical calculus between negotiation and resistance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of cultural preservation amid change emerges organically from graffiti motifs and the stone chip, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing, inviting reflection on adaptation's cost. Subtext in implications like "sharks wearing suits" enriches complexity. No thematic echo or overt statements mar the ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV on Maya is stable with distinct perceptual signature in orderly intuitive decoding, and rhythmic prose modulates with pressure, like shorter sentences during the gathering; elision in action plans is taught and paid off at closure. Minimal dialogue is natural and subtextual, advancing the announcement. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid metaphors like "scattered prayers" advancing atmosphere, varying syntax for rhythm; no major loops or artifacts, though some figurative density in the final paragraph borders on overwriting without muddling clarity. Information density is high, with sentences multitasking character and setting. Opening and closing lines anchor voice effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of floating community with graffiti as resistance code transforms tropes of gentrification through specific details like incorporating as heritage, feeling inevitable in hindsight; risk in hybrid structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, meeting the 9+ test. No derivative echoes, with authenticity in voice and premise.</comment>
