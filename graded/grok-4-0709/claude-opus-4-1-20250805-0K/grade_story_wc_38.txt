<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's motivation as a lyrical code breaker is clear and intensifies compellingly through her dance, rooted in inherited traits that drive higher-stakes revelations; interiority is embodied in movements rather than stock phrasing, with emotions contradictory in her calm defiance amid destiny's weight. The final renunciation of ignorance forecloses paths with felt cost in the "welcome home" message. Strength lies in micro-choices like reversing steps, revealing value hierarchy. Minor slip in over-tidy emotional progression without deeper irrationality caps at high band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Structure accumulates texturally through dance patterns and revelations, with clear orientation in the flooded lab by the first paragraph; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with the message and spiral, reweighting inheritance with conceptual cost of transformed vulnerability. Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural without ambiguity. Persistent constraint of the journal and dice shapes tactics, culminating in resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The flooded laboratory anchors vividly early, with sensory details like brackish water and green sunlight filtered through POV bias; environment constrains choices, as water eddies mirror screen patterns and enable dance translation. Recurring objects like dice and journal charge the final spiral image. Selective, purposeful specificity evolves causally, heightening atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding the journal escalates texturally through dance intensification, with one meaningful deepening in the reversal sequence that narrows options and reveals the message; agency in calm defiance drives agency, foreclosing ignorance with felt cost in inherited destiny. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, but lacks a sharper ethical calculus for peak choice. Coincidence of dice balancing complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transforming vulnerability into strength emerges organically from dance and inheritance, with subtext in impossible geometries and spiral motifs; final image offers resonant, non-literal answer by repricing human limitation as alive mystery. Emotional aftereffect lingers through purposeful ambiguity without confusion. Strength in avoiding tidy morals, but minor drift in overt journal quote slightly echoes thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in movement-as-translation bias; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, lyric syntax that modulates with dance intensity. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision of backstory anchors in present cues like journal opening. Strength in prose as character, reflecting Maya's mind, but slight register drift in philosophical quotes feels mildly unmotivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and revelation without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, as in water-swirling descriptions building propulsion. No artifacts obscure closure; figurative language like spider web is purposeful and coherent. Opening anchors voice, final line recharges motifs with spiral image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of code-breaking via dance transforms trope of inheritance quest, feeling inevitable through specific dice behavior and lab setting; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in mysterious familiarity avoids generics. Bold commitment to premise without hedging elevates ingenuity.</comment>
