<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in Kessa's traits as a pilot seeking resilience, intensifying to compel her upward choice at the split; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion in her tracing the arrow tip, revealing character under pressure. However, internal conflict lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, trending toward summary rather than scene. The final endurance and realization earn a meaningful change with felt conceptual cost, fitting the length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned echoes and inversions to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Kessa's insertion of the arrow tip reweights resilience as dancing with change, with undeniable conceptual cost for the colony's adaptation. Orientation anchors early in the skiff navigation; one meaningful deepening at the grove discovery suffices. Minor ellipsis in knowledge flood feels motivated but slightly softens causality at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with floating arches and upward rivers constraining choices like the narrow gap navigation; sensory details reflect POV bias, and the spherical grove charges the final image by mirroring resilience. Environment evolves causally with Inversion, affecting action without static repetition. Recurring water flows function as micro-setting that shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding resilience signals early and deepens through the Inversion's pressure, forcing stance crystallization under Situational elements within the Textural lens; one tightening at the monument approach narrows options with visible cost in ignoring gravity. Agency in choosing upward and pressing the arrow earns the reconfiguration, though coincidence of echoes complicates without resolving. Moral calculus sharpens the peak, but stakes occasionally abstract rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of resilience as defying constants emerges organically from images like upward water and echoes, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer at the light eruption that reweights adaptation without moralizing. Subtext in silence and echoes invites reflection on change; emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through complexity. Final image offers Conceptual Repricing with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Kessa's navigation by currents; prose texture distinct in rhythmic descriptions of whirling silence, modulating with intensity. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision in echoes is patterned and taught early, paying off at closure. Diction fits POV lexicon without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere in lines like "whirling silence pressed against her ears"; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops or scaffold, though minor synonym churn in "resilience" repetitions. No artifacts obscure closure; final line resolves by recharging motifs with propulsion. Syntactic variety supports emphasis under stress.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise of gravity-defying planet with echo gatherings offers fresh synthesis of sci-fi elements, transformed through Kessa's specific navigation and arrow tip; risk in textural structure heightens stakes organically. Turns feel inevitable from water wisdom, committing to implications without retreat. Emotional specificity in discovery avoids generics, with non-obvious reconfiguration at monument.</comment>
