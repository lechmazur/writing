<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to honor overlooked histories is clear and intensifies through her deliberate actions, rooted in her grandmother's teachings and embodied in her gentle movements; interiority is concrete, with contradictory impulses like reverence for impermanence versus the pain of erasure shown in her careful knotting. Emotions are embodied without therapy-speak, as in the "blushing stillness" reflecting her hushed focus. The meaningful endurance in creating temporary structures forecloses permanence with a felt conceptual cost at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned reflections and symbolic constructions, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the butterfly's departure reweights impermanence with conceptual cost; orientation anchors early in the grotto description. Closure lands on-page with the dissolving structures and Mira's descent, charging the fleeting with undeniable pressure. One meaningful cadence shift at the monarch's arrival suffices for this length, though causality feels more textural than strictly motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The verdant grotto is vividly specific, with moss curtains and weeping crevices constraining Mira's actions and charging the final image of dissolving structures; sensory details like filtered light and paused droplets reflect her perceptual bias and urgency. Environment evolves causally, mirroring internal impermanence without overt symbolism. A recurring object like the moth wing constrains choices and recharges closure, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of honoring erased histories via signals tightens meaningfully when the monarch arrives and interacts, deepening the conceptual cost of impermanence under the textural lens; one cadence shift narrows options, forcing Mira's renunciation of permanence. Pressure coheres through accumulating patterns, with agency in her knotting foreclosing lasting monuments. Cost is legible in the butterfly's doomed flight carrying spores, though stakes remain somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence and overlooked histories emerges organically from Mira's temporary structures and the monarch's migration, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in erased existences; subtext in gestures like knot patterns invites reflection. The final image of dissolving works offers a resonant, non-literal answer to honoring the fleeting, reweighting prior material without statement. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars like the moth wing's dust.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in selective noticing of powdery scales and prisms, modulating rhythm to heighten stillness; no dialogue present. Patterned elision in reflective blocks is taught early and pays off at closure, with diction like "interrupted cadence" voice-motivated and consistent. Distinct texture under pressure satisfies the 9+ test without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in deliberate sentences like the knot pattern description advancing atmosphere; no significant loops or artifacts, though some figurative density in the grotto risks muddle but pays off texturally. Information propels forward without scaffold, and final line recharges motifs cleanly. Zero loops and clear propulsion in peak beats like the butterfly's landing support high marks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of extinction, forgotten civilizations, and moth-encoded histories feels inevitable through Mira's esoteric realism, transforming tropes like migration into a non-obvious impermanence honor; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise commits fully, with specificity in cloud dwellers' wind patterns avoiding generics. A non-obvious reconfiguration at the histories' touch elevates it.</comment>
