<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper's motivation to witness change without judgment is clear and intensifies through her daily rituals, with interiority concrete in her deliberate softening of certainty; emotions are embodied in her handling of the swan and river-watching, revealing contradictory impulses like gripping reality loosely amid perpetual transformation. However, internal conflict remains more summarized than simultaneous in scene, slightly softening the hierarchy of values at the end. The final renunciation of speech earns credible endurance with the felt cost of isolation, foreclosing paths to interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery of decay and regeneration, with orientation anchored early in the underground library; closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing in the final paragraph, reweighting the keeper as a living document with conceptual cost of dissolving certainties. However, causality is loose without motivated ellipsis changing options, and there's no meaningful tightening beyond textural density increase. The ending reconfigures meaning but lacks a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The overgrown library and obsidian refuge are vividly specific, with sensory details like phosphorescent moss and murmuring river filtered through the keeper's bias, constraining her choices by isolating her in perpetual twilight; the setting evolves causally as books become mulch, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Environment charges the final image of the library as an ecosystem, meeting the 9+ test. Tone supports the crumbling peace through purposeful green darkness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of witnessing change signals early but escalates only through textural density in imagery like word-mushrooms, with one cadence shift in the swan's map reweighting without narrowing options; pressure coheres poetically but remains abstract, lacking a visible cost or trade-off that forces stance crystallization. Coincidence in explorers' visits complicates without resolving. The conceptual cost at closure is felt but not driven by protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of regenerative silence emerges organically from images like the folding swan and decomposing books, inviting reflection on truth's fluidity without tidy morals; subtext in gestures like handing paper to explorers implies lived transformation, with the final image offering a resonant, non-literal answer to chronicling as perpetual change. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through crumbling peace. However, some abstraction in phrases like "pure witness, pure change" borders on pseudo-profundity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with controlled focalization, perceptual signature biased toward natural metaphors like vines claiming shelves; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, lyric prose that modulates with emotional intensity, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; non-standard punctuation in em-dashes is consistent and voice-motivated. Meets 9+ with rhythmic control under the textural lens, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "pages had transformed into soil"; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops, with syntactic variety in flowing descriptions. No significant artifacts or overwriting muddle peak moments, though some figurative language clusters in the library description without harming clarity. Opening anchors voice strongly, final line resolves with resonant image; zero loops meet 9+ test, but minor scaffold in repeated "she" stems holds below exceptional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise of a silent keeper chronicling through living transformation offers fresh synthesis of history as ecosystem, with ingenuity in the swan's cryptic folds constraining her worldview; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Tropes of underground wisdom are transformed through specific details like word-mushrooms. Authenticity coheres as singular vision, earning risk bonus.</comment>
