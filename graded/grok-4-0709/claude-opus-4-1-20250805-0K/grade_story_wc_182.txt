<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as an arcane linguist is clear and intensifies through her resourceful actions, like marking paths with silk and speaking dead languages, revealing contradictory impulses in her negotiation with the mountain; however, her traits lean archetypal without deeper internal contradictions under stress, slightly limiting emotional embodiment at the climax where she offers to complete the diary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages from entry to negotiation, culminating in a decisive change where the mountain accepts Mira's offer, releasing seekers with visible cost in their prior entrapment; orientation anchors early in the stone door scene, and one meaningful tightening at the trap room pays off without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices like the circular trap room and charging the final image of amber-cracking release; sensory details, such as humming books and glowing specimens, integrate into action, with the mountain's voice felt through stone mirroring Mira's internal resolve.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of accessing unlearned lessons escalates causally through traps and deepens at the heart's negotiation, forcing Mira's agency in offering future knowledge with felt cost of hoarded wisdom; one meaningful tightening in the trap room narrows options effectively, though secondary time traveler elements slightly dilute focus without resolving coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transforming unlearned lessons into seeds emerges organically from events like the diary's glowing pages and mountain negotiation, offering resonant ambiguity in redemption without tidy morals; the final image of self-filling pages reweights the premise with conceptual cost, eliciting emotional aftereffect through possibility's symphony.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual signature in Mira's linguistic bias, like noticing patterns in roots; voice texture is distinct and rhythmic, modulating with pressure in the trap room, though minimal dialogue limits subtext opportunities but fits the solitary quest.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, as in the singing books' symphony bypassing language; some figurative stacking in the heart chamber risks overwriting, but high information density advances atmosphere without loops, and clarity holds at closure with the mountain's thrumming acceptance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic magic, time travel, and living mountain transforms library tropes through specific choices like gap-researching and diary negotiation, feeling inevitable at the redemptive climax; risk-taking in the symphonic tone heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
