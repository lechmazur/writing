<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in her discovery of the locust shell that stirs a memory of lost beauty, leading to her high-stakes performance; interiority is concrete and embodied in her playing, with contradictory impulses evident in the suspended moment between knowing and understanding the cost. The final endurance forecloses safety with felt cost, as she plays herself empty, becoming the shell for others' freedom. No stock phrasing mars the specificity, and her flaws—perhaps a reckless idealism—complicate the choice without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through resonant patterns of memory and melody, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where statues' hearts break free and the orchard awakens, with conceptual cost legible in Lira's self-emptying; orientation anchors early with the sky-bridge and orchard. Closure lands on-page with charged poise in the chaotic bloom, though the alarm bells introduce a slight coincidental complication without fully resolving. One meaningful cadence shift suffices, but the ending's open suspension slightly softens the before/after legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The enchanted orchard is vividly specific, with trees in welded angles and compacted grids mirroring internal mechanization, constraining Lira's choice by providing the statues as listeners; sensory details like humming iron and shivering branches are purposeful, evolving causally as the ground cracks. The setting pressures the climax, charging the final image of walking trees and dancing statues. Micro-setting of the bridge and violin integrates into action, with no generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reawakening beauty signals early and deepens through the melody's accumulation, narrowing options as statues falter and the orchard stirs, forcing Lira's endurance with visible cost in her emptying; under Accumulative/Textural lens, the cadence shift reweights stakes effectively. One meaningful intensification via the shattering hearts suffices, driven by her agency. Moral calculus between efficiency and imperfection sharpens the peak, though squadron arrival feels slightly coincidental.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transformation through breaking free emerges organically from the locust shell motif and melody, resisting tidy morals by embracing chaos and cost, with ambiguity in Lira's sacrifice lingering resonant; subtext in gestures like the statue's seed-giving invites reflection. The final image offers a non-literal answer, repricing beauty's inefficiency. No overt statements or forced symbolism dilute it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward rhythmic, musical noticing, like translating heartbeats into melody; prose texture is distinct in lyrical rhythm, modulating with intensity. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; purposeful compression in suspended moments is taught and pays off at closure. Diction fits Lira's worldview without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and pressure, like "the first note emerged resonantly soft" doing double work; rhythm varies naturally, though some figurative stacks in the climax, such as "tarnished wonder caught fire," border on muddle without harming clarity. No loops or scaffolds evident; final line recharges motifs effectively. Minor overwriting in peak beats slightly dulls propulsion but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanized fantasy with musical rebellion feels inevitable, transforming tropes like guardian statues through specific rhythms and locust metaphor; risk in lyrical open ending heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional complexity in imperfection's grace avoids generics. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on efficiency vs. beauty.</comment>
