<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elsa's reticent nature and motivation are concretely rooted in her history of supply runs and silent communication with Jonas, compelling her choices under pressure; interiority is embodied through her handling of the sea glass and steady words at the climax. The ghosts' isolation mirrors her traits, creating a crucible that forces her transformation without stock phrasing. Flaws like Jonas's translucent form feel integrated, revealing her hierarchy of values in protecting the lost. </comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the plot advances through motivated linkages from the letters to the stone messages and lantern relighting, with clear orientation by the dock arrival; closure is a Decisive Change as Elsa becomes the guardian, with felt cost in embracing purposeful isolation evident in the ghosts' weeping tears. One meaningful tightening occurs when she interprets the cairns, narrowing options to climb and confront. </comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse and beach are vividly anchored with sensory details like phosphorescent foam and breathing stairs, filtered through Elsa's POV; the lantern room constrains her choice, charging the final image of stacking stones on the gallery deck. Micro-setting of the sea glass as a recurring object evolves to pulse with moonlight, mirroring her internal shift. </comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of combating isolation escalates causally from the dead lamp to the ghostly revelation, tightening when Elsa places her hand on the lamp, foreclosing her old life with the cost of eternal vigilance; agency drives the relighting, with pressure coherent under the Causal lens. One deepening suffices, as the sea glass's warmth changes her knowledge and options. </comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transforming isolation into purposeful protection emerges organically from stacked stones and the sea glass motif, culminating in a resonant final image of ghosts' tears as sea glass without stated moral; subtext in Jonas's flickering form and Elsa's steady words invites reflection on loneliness's ache. Emotional aftereffect is concrete, avoiding sentimentality through her earned insight. </comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Elsa's wave-preferring bias and rhythmic prose modulating with ascent's echoes; dialogue carries subtext, like Jonas's whispered pleas advancing the haunting reveal. No head-hopping, and elision of her journey is motivated, paying off at the dock. </comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in the spiral stairs' breathing and lamp's blaze; metaphors like "dead eye a wound" propel atmosphere without muddle, though minor synonym churn in "flickered out" and "snuffed it out" is present but doesn't touch closure. Information advances in every line, with strong verbs driving the relighting beat. </comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of haunted lighthouse trope through stone messages and bottled safety, feeling inevitable as Elsa's reticence enables her guardianship; risk in ghostly collective snuffing the lamp heightens stakes without gimmickry. Avoids stock echoes by grounding in her supply skipper role. </comment>
