<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to preserve truth is clear and intensifies through contradictory impulses of solitude versus collaboration, culminating in an earned choice to join the woman with felt cost of cracking composure; the woman's secondary pressure reveals his flaws without stereotypes, though interiority occasionally leans toward summary in his three-year reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure accumulates revelations in a single scene with early orientation in the sewer tunnel; closure lands as Charged Poise when Marcus takes the journal and descends, reconfiguring his isolation with conceptual cost of hidden truths, though one ellipsis in backstory slightly softens causality without breaking the pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sunken city ruins vividly anchor atmosphere with sensory details like green-tinted water and barnacles, constraining choices through submersion and directly charging the final descent image; micro-setting of the sewer and cog object evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving true history tightens through revelations under Accumulative lens, with one meaningful deepening when the woman admits knowing the truth, forcing Marcus's stance crystallization; cost is legible in his composure cracking, though agency leans passive until the final acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of competing narratives emerges organically from events and the cog motif, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights truth as sediment needing time without stated moral; subtext in dialogue implications invites reflection on history's invention, avoiding tidy resolutions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in Marcus's abrasive calm; dialogue pursues goals with subtext and natural rhythm, distinguishing characters; syntax modulates purposefully under pressure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose maintains high density and propulsion with varied rhythm and concise sentences advancing atmosphere; metaphors like tide-reciding plague are controlled and coherent, with zero loops or artifacts in peak beats, especially the journal's weight charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-plague sunken city with philosophical rebellion transforms tropes through specific details like the misdated cog, heightening stakes organically; risk in quiet, dialogue-driven structure pays off without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
