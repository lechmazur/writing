<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to fuse insight with empathy drives consistent, intensifying choices, embodied in contradictory impulses during the subsuming; interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions layered through sensory details like the "cold, dense stone" in his chest. Flaws like obsessive empathy complicate the resolution, accepting sorrow's cost in Earned Stasis. The hierarchy of values reveals through micro-choices, such as hovering fingers and centering breath, foreclosing unsustainable paths.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, density increases through layered sensations leading to Charged Poise closure, where Kael decants joy but retains sorrow's residue as felt cost in the final image. Orientation anchors early with "amber grotto" and Kael at center. One meaningful deepening suffices, with causality holding via perceptual buildup without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The amber grotto's crystalline walls and dusk light vividly anchor and evolve, constraining choices by preserving light and humming resonance that aids sensing; it charges the final image as walls glow, mirroring internal luminescence. Sensory details are selective, POV-biased toward dust, ozone, and electric crackle, integrating into action without stalling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of crafting a half-truth without sorrow escalates texturally through deepening sensory charges, narrowing options as negative drag clings; agency in subsuming and decanting forecloses full truth, with legible cost in retained sorrow. One intensification suffices, driven by protagonist's empathy under coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of half-truths' unsustainability emerges organically from Kael's process, reweighted in the final image of decanting joy while accepting sorrow's cost, offering resonant ambiguity without moralizing. Subtext in images like "flower without roots" invites reflection on empathy's price. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward electric sensations and emotional textures, modulating rhythm under pressure like the "rush of fizzing" dissolution. Prose texture distinct in syntax and diction, teaching patterned compression early; no dialogue, so policy not applied.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in sentences like the extended sensory rush, free of loops or artifacts; metaphors cohere without muddle, as in "cold and heavy weight that clung like damp silk." Information advances atmosphere and character, with strong verbs and specificity heightening closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotion forgery in a sensory grotto transforms tropes through specific electric sensing and empathy's cost, feeling inevitable; risk in introspective structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Premise commits fully, avoiding generics with memorable perceptual angle.</comment>
