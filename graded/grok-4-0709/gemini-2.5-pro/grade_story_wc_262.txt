<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find unused love is clear and intensifies through the psychometry, compelling her realization with embodied emotion and contradictory impulses in the vision; interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing, as seen in her building the world "from the inside out." The single-POV focus excels in showing internal conflict via micro-choices like unspooling the film, with flaws like loneliness driving her journey without hedging. No second character limits relationship crucibles, but this fits scope without penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through sensory layers and pattern of emotional residue, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing closure where unused love's absorption reweights her quest with melancholic cost in the final melody; orientation anchors early in the booth. One meaningful deepening suffices, with the vision shard as a coherent extension. Minor elision in vision transition is taught and pays off without causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The vintage projection booth constrains Elara's choices, with dust, grimy glass, and ventilation hum charging the atmosphere and final realization; sensory details like rust taste and velvet seats are selective, POV-filtered, and evolve to mirror her insight. Micro-setting of the film strip as object integrates action, constraining her psychometry. Environment charges the closure image of love in the air she breathes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding unused love tightens through visionary deepening, narrowing options to absorption realization under Accumulative/Textural lens; one cadence shift with felt cost in breathless reverence suffices. Pressure coheres via emotional residue, forcing stance crystallization. Coincidence of the film's residue complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of unused love's transformation emerges organically from vision particulars, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the theater's soul; subtext in images like dust motes and hushed thunder invites reflection. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer reweighting the premise without statement. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete melancholy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature in spatial imagination and sensory bias; voice texture in rhythmic, purposeful syntax heightens emotional intensity. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets. Patterned elision in vision is taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel the buildup; metaphors like "hushed thunder" cohere without muddle, advancing atmosphere. No loops or scaffolds, though some figurative layering in vision approaches overwriting but pays off in closure. Information advances story without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry with unused love in a movie palace feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific Arthur-Iris vision; risk in textural structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generics, with non-obvious angle on adoration's storage.</comment>
