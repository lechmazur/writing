<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo's motivation to discover what ceilings hide is clear and intensifies compellingly, driving his choice to engage despite dread, with interiority embodied in his upward gaze and steady heart; the moment of dragging the ladder reveals a hierarchy of values with subtle cost. However, the ghost lacks depth as a secondary figure, reducing relational pressure. Contradictory impulses are present but could layer more visibly in the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure links events tightly—power cut causes ghost appearance, leading to investigation and resolution—with orientation anchored early in the job and setting; closure is a Decisive Change as the ghost fades after the task's completion, with conceptual cost in mending the veil. The single meaningful tightening at the power cut narrows options effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is vividly specific with peeling paint, phantom popcorn, and cracked clown smiles that mirror the core concept, constraining Leo's choice via the disturbed dust on the ceiling tile; this environment charges the final image of the brass cylinder. Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered, evolving with the silence after power loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering hidden truths tightens causally when the power cut reveals the ghost, forcing Leo's engagement with a felt dread as cost; agency drives the ladder ascent and retrieval, narrowing options. However, stakes remain somewhat internal without sharper external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of liminal spaces and unfinished tasks emerges organically from events like the ghost's worry and the hidden barrel, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in gestures and silence adds complexity. The piece invites reflection on burdens through ambiguity in Leo's purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Leo's upward focus and observational bias; prose texture modulates rhythmically, as in the silence crashing down, with no head-hopping or unwarranted certainty. Purposeful compression in the vision jolt pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in lines like "silence crashed down, thick and absolute," avoiding loops or artifacts; metaphors are coherent and propel momentum, especially in the ceiling analysis beat. No overwriting muddles peak moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes ghost-seeing with elevator repair and circus decay in a fresh way, transforming tropes through specific details like the mainspring barrel; risk in the quiet, internal resolution heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry. However, the ghost resolution echoes familiar patterns slightly.</comment>
