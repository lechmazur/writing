<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to translate texture into sound is clear and rooted in embodied traits like copper-veined skin that feels the world, intensifying to compel the high-stakes alignment at the climax. Interiority is concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses shown in steady hands trembling during the prayer beyond words, earning the final renunciation of old echoes with felt conceptual cost. No second character, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant; the single-POV focus on internal conflict and micro-choices under pressure elevates this to exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through descriptive density and pattern to a resonant reconfiguration at the end, where silence unravels echoes into a new true word, with conceptual cost in the language's transformation. Orientation anchors early in the Chasm of In-An, and the single continuous scene holds without transitions. Closure lands on-page with the blooming tone as a charged poise that reweights the stake, holding the lens without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting of bone towers and echoing canyon is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like ridged vertebrae and dust-colored sky filtered through the POV's tactile bias, constraining the climactic choice on the spire. Atmosphere supports the theme of trapped sounds, and the environment charges the final image by emanating the bone's texture as sound. Micro-setting of the tower directly alters tactics, meeting the 9+ test exceptionally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of saving the Old Tongue signals early and deepens through the diamond's alignment, driven by protagonist agency under the textural lens, with a cadence shift narrowing options at silence. One meaningful intensification at the spiral formation forces stance crystallization, and the conceptual cost of unraveling echoes is legible on-page. Coincidence of starlings complicates but does not resolve; strength in the earned reconfiguration, though cost feels more triumphant than sacrificial.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of language etched in the world's substance emerges organically from images like vertebra textures and starling patterns, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in silence and blooming sound invites reflection on revival's cost, earned through specific struggle. The non-literal answer to translating texture charges prior material exceptionally, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in vein-felt vibrations and purposeful compression in lyric descriptions that teach patterns early. Narrative voice modulates rhythmically under pressure, like the whipping wind and trembling raise, without elision issues. No dialogue, so those bullets ignored; rhythmic control heightens the climax without obscurity, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and rhythm accelerating at the climax, free of loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle; lines like "a river of black ink flowing through the air" advance atmosphere and character simultaneously. High information density and clear sequencing shine in the alignment moment, with zero artifacts touching closure. Read-aloud flow is natural, and the final line recharges motifs impeccably, meeting the 9+ test fully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of copper-veined storyteller, cursed diamond, and starling patterns transforms familiar isolation tropes into a non-obvious premise of texture-as-language, feeling inevitable at the blooming sound. Risk-taking in poetic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the singular vision coheres authentically. One fresh inflection in the flock's geometry as syntax elevates this, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
