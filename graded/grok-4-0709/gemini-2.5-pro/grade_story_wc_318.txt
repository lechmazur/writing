<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ghost's motivation to restore laughter is clear and intensifies through embodied sorrow and eagerness, compelling the pulls on the cord; interiority is concrete, with contradictory helplessness and love acting in the third pull, earning the engine's roar without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through failed pulls to a roaring symphony, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration with the wife's smile and tear, reweighting grief with healing at a felt cost of the ghost's eternal tether; orientation anchors early in the house and garage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The hallway as echo chamber tunnel vividly constrains the performance, amplifying the roar and melody to charge the wife's recognition in the final image; sensory details like dust motes and tracked leaves mirror neglect, integrated purposefully without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring laughter tightens through the ghost's pulls and orchestration under Accumulative/Textural pressure, with agency in guiding the blower forcing a deepening that narrows silence to a fragile smile; cost is legible in his poured being and sliver of peace, though secondary family reactions feel slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of loving haunting emerges organically from the symphony's melody weaving into the roar, offering a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration of grief via the wife's tear and twitch, embracing complexity without moralizing; subtext in distorted lullabies invites lingering ambiguity on healing's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV stays stable with a distinct perceptual signature in mournful eagerness, modulating rhythm from silence to roar without slippage; prose texture in syntax like "mournfully eager" reflects the ghost's state, with no dialogue to evaluate but clean focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density and propulsion with vivid, varied rhythm in lines like the engine's scream ripping stillness, free of loops or artifacts; metaphors like "leaf blower symphony conductor" are coherent and purpose-driven, accelerating momentum to the softened roar without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghostly haunting as noisy care transforms tropes through specific leaf blower orchestration and off-key lullabies, feeling inevitable with risk in spectral mechanics heightening emotional stakes; the premise commits fully without hedging, avoiding derivative echoes.</comment>
