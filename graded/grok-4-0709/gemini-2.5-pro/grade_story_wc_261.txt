<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to read scars is clear and rooted in traits, intensifying through the ritual to compel the final renunciation with felt cost of ongoing wounding; interiority is concrete and embodied, showing contradictory impulses in the tunneling beat where he pushes past the ivy's pain into his own. However, some emotions lean toward stock phrasing like "raw, vibrating agony," slightly diluting specificity under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and realizations to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Elias accepts carrying scars as his role, with legible cost in loneliness; orientation anchors early in the tower post-anesthesia. The single-scene scope fits, with density increasing via the ritual and ivy interaction to reweight the stake effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The quiet tower at dawn is vividly anchored with purposeful sensory details like the ivy's pulse and chemical scent, filtered through Elias's altered perception; the ivy as recurring object constrains his telepathic experience and charges the final image of sterile light, mirroring his isolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of seeking closure through scars tightens via the tunneling ritual, deepening to reweight options under the Accumulative lens with felt cost in the resonant agony and ivy's withdrawal; agency in endurance forecloses healing paths, though the pressure feels more internal than externally tested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of embracing wounds over forced closure emerges organically from the displaced miracle and scar-reading ritual, culminating in a resonant, non-literal final image that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in the ivy's pulse and hourglass adds complexity, inviting reflection on patient survival.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Elias's sensory bias toward scars and plants; prose texture in rhythmic, compressed syntax heightens emotional beats, with purposeful elision in the tunneling taught and paid off at closure. No dialogue present, so ignored.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, multi-job sentences like the ivy's "slow, green pulse," varying rhythm naturally without loops or artifacts; metaphors are coherent and propel momentum, especially in the tunneling beat, though one mixed image ("meteor hush") slightly muddles but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of accidental plant telepathy from a failed scar-erasure synthesizes fresh elements into an inevitable realization, transforming trope of self-inflicted wounds through specific details like coffee-ring divination; risk in lyric introspection heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
