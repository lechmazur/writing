<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to preserve the prophet's wisdom is clear and intensifies through his actions, rooted in his strangely honest trait that compels him to confront distortions; interiority is concrete, with embodied calm and peripheral awareness showing contradictory impulses between isolation and duty. The final consecration earns a meaningful renunciation of communal debate, with felt mental cost in the "staggering mental weight." Strength lies in micro-choices like pacing the spiral, revealing values under pressure. No major flaws, but lacks deeper internal contradiction in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through textured whispers to a resonant reconfiguration in the consecration, with cadence shift reweighting the stake via the pulsing sphere; closure lands as Earned Stasis, preserving truth with conceptual cost of isolation legible in the final hum. Orientation anchors early in the pavilion, with clear who/where/when by 120 words. Minor slip in ellipsis from pavilion to dunes, but it serves textural flow without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The dunes and pavilion are vivid, purposeful settings that constrain choices, with the shifting sand and murmuring whispers mirroring internal doubt; the kinetic parapet as micro-setting charges the final image by enabling the consecration. Sensory details are selective, biased through Kael's calm focus, evolving causally from sun-bleached rib to retracting dune. Strength in how environment guides action, like the staircase spiral, without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving wisdom signals early and deepens through textural accumulation of distortions, culminating in a cadence shift that reweights options with mental cost; agency in consecration forecloses communal misinterpretation. One meaningful intensification via the disciple's false declaration forces Kael's exit and ritual. Cost is felt in the "staggering mental weight" during the critical void-filling moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of preserving pure truth amid distortion emerges organically from images of dissolving salt and echoing whispers, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the sealed sphere that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in silence and peripheral awareness invites reflection on attachment versus zeal. Strength in the final image offering conceptual repricing of wisdom's fragility, with ambiguity lingering authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with distinct perceptual signature in Kael's calm, biased noticing of sounds and edges; voice texture in rhythmic, purposeful syntax heightens textural lens without elision issues. Brief dialogue is natural, subtextual, advancing plot via honest rebuke. Rhythmic control under pressure, as in the spiral pacing, supports emotional beats cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally in descriptions like "sea of silent, shifting gold"; no loops or scaffold, though minor figurative muddle in "loom of sound" is isolated and doesn't obscure closure. Information propulsion advances via strong verbs and integrated details, with final line recharging motifs effectively. Strength in clarity at consecration pulse, free of artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Originality in synthesizing fantasy elements like kinetic parapet and peripheral awareness into a fresh angle on truth preservation, transforming trope of prophetic wisdom through Kael's honest isolation; risk in textural, meditative structure heightens stakes organically. Core premise feels inevitable via specific psychic mechanics, avoiding derivatives. Minor hedging in familiar desert motif, but ingenuity in closure's conceptual repricing elevates.</comment>
