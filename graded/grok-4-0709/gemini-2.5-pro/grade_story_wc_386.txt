<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to salvage purity is clear and rooted in her wreck-diver traits, intensifying through trance choices that culminate in exposing the truth; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like the air growing heavy, avoiding stock phrasing. The final renunciation of the man's lie earns a meaningful endurance with felt cost in the soul's release. Weakness lies in limited simultaneous contradictory impulses during peak pressure, but micro-choices under stress reveal her values effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through gathered dream fragments with pattern break at the confrontation, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the boy's smile and fading reweight the tragedy with conceptual cost in the globe as memorial. Orientation anchors early in the glacier shrine. Closure lands on-page with undeniable pressure and lightness as felt cost, shaped by persistent dream-ocean constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The glacier shrine setting is vivid and purposeful, with weeping walls and candlelight constraining Elara's trance and charging the final image of the steadied flames and lifted globe. Sensory details like blue cold and heavy air reflect POV urgency and mirror internal release. Environment evolves causally, pressuring choices without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of releasing the boy's soul tightens through accumulated dream glimpses, with one meaningful deepening at the shared dreamscape forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the tragedy's weight lifting, though coincidence in manifestations slightly complicates without resolving. Agency in weaving truth drives escalation, narrowing options with visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging truth from wreckage emerges organically through dream fragments and the globe motif, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer as the artifact becomes a memorial, reweighting purity without moralizing. Subtext in the man's eclipse and boy's smile invites reflection on lies and release. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality via concrete images like borrowed starlight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in dream-ocean metaphors biased by Elara's vigil; voice texture distinct in rhythmic, lyric compression that teaches patterned elision early and pays off at closure. Phantom dialogue carries subtext and advances the confrontation naturally. No head-hopping or register drift under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in trance beats without loops or scaffold; metaphors like "human eclipse" are coherent and propel momentum. Final line recharges the globe motif effectively. Minor overwriting in descriptive stacks during setup, but no artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychic wreck-diving in glacial dreams transforms ghost tropes through specific trance mechanics and dream-cameos, feeling inevitable with risk in the shared confrontation heightening stakes. Emotional complexity in the boy's quiet finality avoids generics. Bold lyric structure coheres without gimmickry.</comment>
