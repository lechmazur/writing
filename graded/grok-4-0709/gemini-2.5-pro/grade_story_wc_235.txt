<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied contradictory impulses, like the "feral nostalgia" gnawing as physical hunger, driving micro-choices such as pushing the scroll away; the final shift to artistry feels earned through the trance's cost of releasing jealousy, avoiding stock epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orientation anchors immediately in the cabin with the charcoal and scroll; accumulative/textural lens holds through reflective buildup to a resonant reconfiguration in the flight vision, landing closure with conceptual cost of reweighted self-perception, though one ellipsis in time confusion is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like sunlight with dust motes and knot-eyed walls mirror internal chaos; the cabin constrains choices by closing in, charging the flight's final image where it becomes a "child's block," though sensory balance leans visual without deeper tactile evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of ordering psychic wreckage tightens through trance intensification under accumulative lens, with jealousy as pressure forcing stance crystallization; cost is felt in the "snapped" overwhelm and awe's reconfiguration, but lacks a secondary accent for fuller depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reconciling fractured timelines emerges organically from flight's reconfiguration, offering resonant non-literal answer in seeing selves as "points on a single, sprawling map"; subtext in images like backward clocks avoids moralizing, eliciting lingering awe without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct first-person voice with perceptual signature in dream-infused observations, like wind as "wild symphony"; rhythmic control heightens pressure in trance without obscurity, and purposeful compression in flight teaches pattern paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in metaphors like "feral nostalgia gnawed," varying rhythm naturally; zero loops or artifacts, though one mixed metaphor ("bitter taste" to "staring eye") is minor and doesn't touch closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time confusion and dream chronicling transforms trope of self-envy into soaring reconfiguration; risk in trance vision heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable without gimmickry, though premise echoes familiar existential motifs.</comment>
