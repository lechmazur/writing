<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between clinging to memory and seeking release, with embodied emotions driving micro-choices like tracing the shell; final renunciation of dropping it is earned by prior grief with visible cost, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the journey builds density through memories and deviation, leading to resonant reconfiguration in the shell's drop with felt cost of reclaimed weight; orientation anchors early, but lacks a sharper persistent constraint for higher band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful details of the cave and oasis filter through POV bias, constraining the choice and charging the final image of the shell settling, meeting the 9+ test with atmospheric resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of fulfilling the promise tightens through the wrong turn's deepening, driven by agency in the release with unmistakable emotional cost under the textural lens, though secondary accents are minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transient forevers emerges organically from images like the cracked mirror and oasis, with the final shell drop offering a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature in sea-gray moods and rhythmic control under grief's pressure, no elision or slippage, meeting the 9+ test fully.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, zero loops or artifacts; evocative lines like "time itself seemed to pool and settle" enhance without muddle, acing the 9+ test in peak moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ingenious wrong turn to oasis synthesizes grief and discovery inevitably, with risk heightening stakes through deviation, though premise echoes familiar loss tropes without bolder subversion.</comment>
