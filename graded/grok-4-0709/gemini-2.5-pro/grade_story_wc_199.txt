<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to decode falling leaves is clear and intensifies compellingly toward the prod, rooted in consistent traits like precision and delight in small things; interiority is concrete and embodied, with emotions shown through actions like trembling hands rather than labels. The transformation feels earned by prior causality, foreclosing his old role with a felt cost of newfound power. A minor slip in overly poetic self-awareness mid-story slightly hedges emotional contradiction, but it doesn't touch the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through leaf patterns and monuments, culminating in a pattern break with the prod's decisive change and resonant reconfiguration of the arbor's state, with visible cost in the shift from sorrow to life. Orientation anchors who (Elian), where (skyborne arbor), and when (perpetual twilight hush) by the first paragraph. Closure lands on-page with the transformation's light and unfurling leaves, reweighting the stake of decoding into becoming.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is vividly specific, with sensory details like brittle leaves and chlorophyll-stained hands filtered through Elian's POV, constraining choices like sorting and monument-building while charging the final image of viridian green revival. Atmosphere of hushed anticipation builds purposefully, mirroring internal transformation without overt symbolism. The setting evolves causally from ash to glow, directly affecting the outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding the leaves to revive the arbor signals early and deepens meaningfully when the special leaf appears, narrowing options to the prod as a stance crystallization under Accumulative lens, with felt cost in the arbor's shiver and Elian's residual light. Pressure coheres through folklore-driven anticipation, though coincidence of the leaf's arrival slightly complicates without resolving. One tightening suffices at this length, earning agency in the deliberate finger prod.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of small acts catalyzing profound transformation emerges organically from Elian's monuments and the prod, resonating through images like the pulsing speck without direct statements, inviting reflection on precision's power. Subtext in the folklore and leaves as memories adds complexity, with the final image offering a non-literal repricing of sorrow into becoming. Emotional aftereffect feels honest, avoiding sentimentality in the mossy delight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature in Elian's selective noticing of curls and veins, modulating rhythm from gentle to thrumming under pressure. Prose texture is distinct in lyrical syntax and word choice like "mossy delight," teaching patterned elision early and paying off at closure without obscurity. No dialogue present, so no evaluation needed; no head-hopping or register drifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally—short sentences accelerate the prod, longer ones build atmosphere—advancing character and stakes without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "brittle as spun sugar" is purposeful and coherent, avoiding muddle in peak beats; opening anchors voice, final line recharges motifs with "monumental power of the very, very small." Minor synonym churn in one descriptive cluster ("ashen, pale, gray") deducts lightly but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise of decoding messages in falling leaves via tiny monuments offers fresh synthesis of folklore and micro-scale agency, transforming tropes of prophecy through Elian's specific choices, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to a singular vision of transformation from small things. No close echoes of famous scenes; emotional specificity in "mossy delight" anchors universality.</comment>
