<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to unburden his swallowed confession through exploration is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in consistent skepticism and recklessness that drive higher-stakes choices like approaching the sounds. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in his scoffing at ghosts yet pursuing them to trade anxieties. The final renunciation of inaction, by turning the valve, is earned with visible emotional cost, foreclosing his passive endurance. Relationships are absent, so those bullets are ignored, but the single-POV interior contradiction elevates this.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure links events through because/therefore progression: the confession leads to exploration, sounds prompt investigation, and turning the valve causes resolution with a decisive change in the ghosts' silence and his earned exhaustion. Orientation anchors who (protagonist), where (tunnel), and when (post-confession hush) by the first paragraph, avoiding penalties. Closure is on-page as a Decisive Change with felt cost in his physical and emotional exertion, holding the lens without contradiction. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length, with the valve interaction as a persistent constraint shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned tunnel and mill are vividly specific, with sensory details like rust smells, oily water, and echoing clangs filtered through the protagonist's drowsy alertness, constraining his choices like wading to the valve. Atmosphere builds oppressive quiet contrasting spectral sounds, mirroring his internal weight and charging the peaceful emptiness at closure. The recurring valve wheel as a micro-setting object constrains the climax and reweights the ending. Tone tensions skepticism with strangeness purposefully, supporting theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, the dominant stake of measuring his swallowed truth escalates through one meaningful tightening: hearing the ghosts shifts from skepticism to direct confrontation, narrowing options and raising the cost of inaction. Protagonist agency drives the deepening via reckless investigation and valve-turning, forcing a trade-off with his anxiety for immediate fear, culminating in a stance crystallization with legible emotional cost. Coincidence of radio calls complicates but doesn't resolve; moral calculus between his "I did nothing" and the ghosts' blame sharpens the peak. One reversal suffices, with pressure coherent until reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of swallowed inaction and ghostly repetition emerges organically from the protagonist's confession mirroring the factory ghosts' endless crisis, inviting reflection on unaddressed failures without tidy morals. Subtext in radio calls and valve interaction implies blame and redemption through implication, with the final peaceful emptiness offering a resonant, non-literal repricing of his burden's weight. Emotional aftereffect arises from concrete struggle, avoiding sentimentality via ambiguity in his ongoing carryable weight. The core concept integrates tightly, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost in the earned exhaustion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward skeptical appraisal and drowsy strangeness, like attributing sounds to pipes before conceding impossibility. Voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, metaphorical prose that modulates with intensity, such as shaky headlamp beams cutting the dark. Radio "dialogue" feels natural and subtextual, advancing plot by interpreting the strangeness without direct speech on-page. No head-hopping or elision issues; psychic distance shifts intentionally serve emotional beats like the cold dread seizure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and rhythm accelerating in the climax, like the groan of metal under his effort, advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful, such as "damp, devouring dark," without muddle or register drift in peak beats. Clarity is high, with strong verbs and specific details like "beaded valve wheel" carrying multiple jobs; no artifacts obscure closure. Read-aloud flows naturally, though one paraphrase loop in describing sounds slightly dulls momentum but doesn't touch the ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes ghost story with personal confession via radio psychic calls, offering a fresh angle on guilt and inaction through the factory ghost shift's interactive blame, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Tropes like haunted mills are transformed by the protagonist's skeptical agency and valve interaction, with emotional specificity avoiding generics. Risk-taking in blending real-time radio with spectral events heightens stakes organically without gimmickry. No close echoes of famous scenes, and the singular vision coheres boldly.</comment>
