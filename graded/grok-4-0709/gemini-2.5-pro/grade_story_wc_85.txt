<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly from guilt to purpose, rooted in his trait of manufacturing memories, with embodied emotions like the "acidic burn" of regret showing contradictory impulses in his search. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, as seen in his desperate sifting that reveals internal conflict without therapy-speak. The final renunciation of his old work for restoration earns stasis with visible cost, foreclosing his black-market life. Relationships are absent, so no penalty there.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elision of memories and discoveries, with orientation anchored by the first sentence in who (Elias), where (cobalt terrace), and when (dusk). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration via conceptual repricing, where realizing the excision reweights his premise with undeniable cost in the "cold, clear purpose" line, making before/after legible. One meaningful deepening occurs at the driftwood revelation, sufficient for length, though causality feels slightly elliptical without stronger because/therefore links. No orientation penalty as anchors serve closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and purposeful, with the cobalt terrace and forgotten shore constraining choices, as the driftwood on the coast directly enables the revelation that charges the final image. Sensory details like "waves whispered against the shingle, a sound like sandpaper on bone" are selective and POV-biased, mirroring Elias's guilt. Environment evolves causally from terrace to coast and back, affecting action without static repetition. Micro-setting of the driftwood and watch hand functions as setting, constraining the closure choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of quelling the ghost through truth-discovery is signaled early and deepens once via the driftwood void, reweighting options under Accumulative/Textural lens with felt cost in his staggered return. Pressure coheres through guilt, forcing stance crystallization at the realization, narrowing to a new purpose without coincidence resolving it. One tightening is sufficient, with agency in endurance foreclosing forgetting, though cost feels more conceptual than visceral at peak. Moral calculus sharpens the choice between lies and restoration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory's fragility and restoration emerges organically from events like the void revelation, inviting reflection on erased histories without tidy morals, as Elias accepts ambiguity in his guilt. Subtext in images like the gouged driftwood implies excision's horror, eliciting emotional aftereffect through complexity. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to withheld truths by repricing silence as a weapon. No overt statements mar it, though motif of hush recurs without fully constraining choice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature in biased noticing like "sieved hush" and rhythmic control modulating with intensity, as in short sentences during the tilt. Prose texture is distinct in syntax and word choice, like "bleeding from blue to bruised purple," teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. No dialogue, so no evaluation there; no head-hopping or unwarranted certainty. Purposeful compression pays off in the revelation without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere and character in lines like "a sound like sandpaper on bone," varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the void flood. Clarity shines in propulsion toward closure, with strong verbs and specific nouns; minor synonym churn in "quiet" variants exists but doesn't dull the final image. No artifacts touch closure, passing the ear test with purposeful paragraph variety.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise of a genealogist restoring erased memories offers a fresh angle on identity and loss, transforming tropes through specific details like driftwood sifting as penance. Emotional specificity in tempered regret feels authentic, with the void-as-excision synthesis inevitable in hindsight. Risk in elliptical structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, cohering as a singular vision. No close echoes of famous works, though familiarity with memory themes is elevated by ingenuity in the power's reversal.</comment>
