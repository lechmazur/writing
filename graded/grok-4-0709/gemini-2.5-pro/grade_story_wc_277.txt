<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Celeste's motivation to uncover hidden truths is clear and intensifies through her calculated intervention, with embodied emotions like the "steady, solemn drum" of her heart revealing contradictory impulses of devotion and revelation. The phone confrontation dismantles the journalist's narrative, showcasing her hierarchy of values with a felt cost in exposing family secrets. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, though secondary character pressure from the journalist is functional but not deeply cruciblesque.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure flows with because/therefore linkages from the initial call's end to Celeste's decision, retrieval of the nib, counter-call, and logical dismantling, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where she feels her father's "painful orbit complete" with emotional cost legible in the final star-gazing image. Orientation anchors who (Celeste), where (observatory above clouds), and when (post-call) within the first paragraph. One meaningful tightening via the proof-by-contradiction argument narrows options and changes knowledge effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The observatory's echoing dome, rotating hum, mahogany desk, and star-dusted sky provide vivid, selective sensory details filtered through Celeste's POV, with the curved glass wall and clouds below charging the final image of her father's completed orbit. Setting constrains her isolation and reflection, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Micro-details like the desk's reflection integrate into action, enhancing atmosphere purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of redeeming her father's legacy escalates causally through the phone confrontation, with her proof-by-contradiction questions tightening pressure and forcing the journalist's stance crystallization, narrowing options with a visible cost in revealing the brother's guilt. Agency drives the deepening, as her intervention reweights the narrative from greed to protection. One meaningful turn suffices, with moral calculus between truth and family loyalty sharpening the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of regret's orbits and protective sacrifices emerges organically from events like the nib's retrieval and contradictory questions, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the father's sorrow without stated morals. Subtext in dialogue implications and the nib's "unwritten narrative" invites reflection on hidden truths. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through complex ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Celeste's biased noticing of rain scents and calendars; voice texture shines in rhythmic metaphors like "star-dusted velvet" that modulate with solemn playfulness. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and goal-driven, advancing the dismantling without as-you-know exposition. No head-hopping or unwarranted certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the cascading questions that propel the confrontation without loops or scaffold; metaphors are controlled but dense in peaks, such as "orbits of regret" and "cascade of failures," occasionally bordering on muddle yet paying off at closure. Clarity holds with strong verbs and purposeful syntax, though figurative stacking in the final reflection slightly dulls propulsion. No major artifacts or redundancies obscure the ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise ingeniously synthesizes family scandal with proof-by-contradiction as intervention, transforming tropes through the observatory's celestial metaphors and Celeste's logical takedown, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk in solemn-playful tone heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry. Fresh angle on regret avoids generics, with authentic vision in the nib's charged role.</comment>
