<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to uncover the truth about Elara is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying to compel his high-stakes redirection; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like the chill seeping through trousers and the crushing weight of truth. Internal conflict shows in his push against the horror, aligning actions with motives and revealing values through micro-choices under pressure. The meaningful endurance forecloses paths with felt emotional cost, though relationships are absent as no second character is on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure holds with because/therefore linkages from sensory mapping to discovery and redirection, anchoring who (Kael), where (spaceport), and when (night of tidal phenomenon) by ~120 words without orientation debt. Closure is a Decisive Change via the energy redirection, with Conceptual Repricing in the final datalog entry, landing on-page with felt emotional cost of understanding parental silence. One meaningful tightening suffices, though ellipsis in parallel visions is motivated and pays off at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is vividly anchored with sensory specificity like rust, cold ozone, and wind frequencies, filtered through Kael's POV bias as a map maker; details constrain choices, such as the stained concrete and fractured gantry shaping his ritual. Atmosphere supports the haunting tone, with the shard's use evolving the environment to charge the final neutral air and silence. The recurring shard as micro-setting constrains the climax and charges the closure image of finality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Causal lens, the dominant stake of discovering Elara's truth signals early and tightens meaningfully when Kael pushes consciousness toward her parallel world, narrowing options to redirection with visible cost of emotional crushing weight. Pressure coheres through the building hum and cascade warnings, forcing stance crystallization without coincidence resolving it. Agency in redirection earns resolution, though internal-external weave is optional and lightly present.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of existence's instability emerges organically from sensory mapping and parallel bleed-through, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the datalog entry that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in withheld parental grief and Elara's vibrant echo invites reflection on loss's weight, with emotional honesty avoiding sentimentality. The final image offers Conceptual Repricing, embracing complexity in the simplified horror.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in sensory details like chai tea scent biased by Kael's map-making; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, evocative syntax modulating with pressure, such as the hum's scream. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; purposeful compression in vision layers is taught early and pays off legibly at closure. Prose as character reflects his attuned mind without register drift or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere and character through vivid lines like "the air did not just shimmer; it fractured," varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold. Clarity holds with strong verbs and specific nouns, though minor figurative density in visions approaches muddle but pays off in pressure. No artifacts obscure closure; opening anchors voice, final line resolves with resonant image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise of sensory mapping parallel universes via alien shard offers fresh synthesis on grief and multiverse instability, transforming tropes through grounded choices like redirecting cascade energy. Emotional specificity in the withheld truth feels memorable and inevitable, with risk in conceptual closure heightening stakes without gimmickry. Core elements cohere organically, avoiding derivative templates.</comment>
