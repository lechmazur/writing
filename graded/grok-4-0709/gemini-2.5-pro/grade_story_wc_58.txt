<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation to map healing through empathetic projection is clear and intensifies compellingly, with interiority concrete and embodied in the thread's texture; however, internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses, slightly softening pressure in the projection beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with strong causality in the projection sequence leading to a conceptual repricing at closure, where understanding Elara's journey reweights absence as triumph; cost is felt in the sharper chill and deeper silence upon return, with orientation anchored early in the garden setting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details in the autumn garden, like damp decay and gilded branches, mirror introspection and constrain Kaelen's isolated mapping; the environment charges the final writing image under dying light, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of comprehending healing tightens through the projection's deepening revelations, reweighting absence under the textural lens; agency in choosing to project and write forecloses isolation with felt emotional cost, though one more explicit trade-off could elevate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of healing as containing pain emerges organically from the woven map and projection, offering a resonant, non-literal answer in the companionship felt at closure; subtext in images like the scarlet thread avoids moralizing, enriching complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature in sensory biases, like wool-and-incense smells; lyrical voice maintains rhythmic control under empathetic pressure, with projection's elision taught early and paid off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative prose achieves high density with varied rhythm and no loops or artifacts; figurative elements, like the crimson haze, propel momentum without muddle, culminating cleanly in the final writing under dying light.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingenious premise of living obituaries via thread-projection synthesizes weaving as grief cartography, transforming familiar absence tropes with fresh emotional specificity; risk in intimate translocation heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at closure.</comment>
