<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Characters feel distinct through actions like Elara's faith contrasting Kaelen's cynicism, with motivations rooted in survival and collective trust that compel the climb; interiority is concrete but limited to group dynamics, avoiding stock phrasing; the ghost's altruism drives choices without overshadowing human flaws, though secondary characters apply pressure unevenly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages from messages to discoveries and climax, anchoring orientation early in the settlement; closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost of leaving the ghost, shaped by persistent planetary constraints; one meaningful tightening suffices, though minor ellipsis in time jumps is motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful details like rust-tasting dust and floating arches constrain the climb and charge the resonant hum at closure; sensory hierarchy reflects desperation, mirroring internal hope; setting evolves causally, with the biodome's figs embodying brambled hope without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of escape tightens through discoveries, forcing collective agency in the impossible climb under causal lens; one deepening narrows options with visible effort-cost, crystallizing stance; coincidence of messages complicates but protagonist actions resolve it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of collective hope amid isolation emerges organically from messages and family bonds, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights their brambled existence without moralizing; subtext in the bell's transformation invites reflection on selflessness; emotional aftereffect lingers through Elara's untroubled smile.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with clean focalization on group and Elara, perceptual signature biased toward hope; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, purposeful syntax; sparse dialogue advances plot with subtext, like Kaelen's grumble revealing cynicism under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and strong verbs, like "coaxed a meager existence" propelling atmosphere; no loops or artifacts, metaphors coherent and voice-motivated; final line recharges motifs with resonant imagery, maintaining propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost guidance and planetary tuning fork transforms survival tropes through specific collective effort; risk in impossible climb heightens stakes organically; premise commits to implications without hedging, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
