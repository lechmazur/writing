<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation to reimagine the civilization is clear and rooted in his traits as a failed revolutionary, intensifying through embodied sorrow and determination; interiority is concrete, with contradictory impulses like burnished sorrow clashing with rekindled fire in the final smile. Emotions are embodied without stock phrasing, and his micro-choices, like leaving the shard exposed, reveal values with felt cost. The single-POV focus excels in showing internal conflict under pressure, earning the resonant endurance at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through reflective density and storm cadence, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the shard's revelations reweight the civilization's narrative with conceptual cost in the heavier silence and banked fire. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first paragraph, with no disorientation debt. Closure lands on-page with felt cost, though one more pattern break could tighten the midpoint accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like gilded filigree and pearlescent squalls filtered through Kaelen's poetic bias; it constrains choices, as mirrors require covering and the shard absorbs the storm to charge the final image. Atmosphere supports the sorrowful tone, evolving causally with the squall to mirror internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving the poets' theory escalates through storm-induced deepening, narrowing options to a charged poise with emotional cost in the sad, determined smile; under Accumulative lens, cadence shift reweights the stake effectively. One meaningful intensification suffices, but the opposition from Valerius remains off-page, slightly softening pressure coherence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of reinterpretation as quiet revolution emerges organically from the shard's revelations, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the civilization's frantic art; subtext in images like the woman's hands offers resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without statement. The final image reweights the premise, eliciting lingering emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with distinct perceptual signature in poetic noticing like "burnished sorrow"; prose texture modulates rhythm under storm pressure, teaching patterned compression that pays off at closure. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision is purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and high information in lines like "a sliver of frozen light"; zero loops or artifacts, figurative language coherent without muddle, even in peak beats. Clarity and concision advance atmosphere seamlessly, charging the final line without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sci-fi archaeology with temporal storms and poetic reinterpretation feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like the shard's absorption; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Fresh angle on revolution as narrative war avoids derivatives.</comment>
