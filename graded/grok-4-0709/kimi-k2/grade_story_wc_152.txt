<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to thwart the coup through embroidery is clear and intensifies via micro-choices like deliberate finger-pricking, revealing a hierarchy of values with embodied cost in the blood drops symbolizing king, heir, and city. Interiority is concrete, with contradictory impulses shown in her foolish mask versus wise actions, culminating in earned stasis as she accepts her role's ongoing cost. Strength lies in flaws complicating choices without hedging, as seen when footsteps approach and she giggles to maintain disguise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, patterns of embroidery and candle flame build density toward a Charged Poise closure where Mira stitches a new constellation, reweighting the stake with conceptual cost of perpetual vigilance. Orientation anchors early in the observatory on the cliff under autumn sky. Strength in patterned elision that teaches motif recurrence, paying off at ending with the candle flickering as if nodding; minor slip in ellipsis of exact coup mechanics doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting vividly anchors in cobalt observatory with tarnished dome and autumn frost, constraining choices like using the great lens for dawn ignition and revealing the secret tunnel. Micro-details like leaves scraping the dome mirror internal pressure, charging the final image of the dome opening like an eye. Environment evolves causally, with flame leaning east to signal plot, directly shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling conspiracy before coup tightens through one meaningful deepening as Mira unstiches to create escape routes, narrowing options with felt cost in blood ciphers. Under Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates via motif density, forcing stance crystallization in her final smile and new stitching. Strength in agency through renunciation of direct action for disguised wisdom, with moral calculus between competing harms legible at the pricked finger moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom disguised as foolishness emerges organically through embroidery motifs and silence-listening, culminating in resonant final image of candle in open hand without stated moral. Subtext in implications like blood as cipher deepens complexity, inviting reflection on unheard stories with purposeful ambiguity. Strength in thematic resonance from particulars, reweighting premise at closure with conceptual repricing of eternal vigilance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, image-rich texture, modulating rhythm under pressure like faster embroidery during footsteps. Patterned diction and syntax reflect Mira's mind, with purposeful compression in motifs taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue, but narrative voice coheres singularly without slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with rhythmic variety and concise, multi-job sentences, as in "leaves scraping the dome like dry wings" advancing atmosphere and momentum. Zero loops or scaffolds, with strong verbs and specific imagery propelling toward closure; figurative language integrates without muddle, heightening the final flickering candle. Minor register elevation in peak beats feels voice-motivated and legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of embroidery as conspiracy-mapping with eternal candle offers fresh angle on surveillance and foresight, feeling inevitable through grounded details like blood ciphers. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes like disguised wisdom into singular vision. Strength in non-obvious reconfiguration at ending, where new constellation gifts future embroiderers.</comment>
