<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rowan's motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly from regret to action, with embodied emotions like trembling precision during repair; interior conflict shows through his recognition of past mistakes, earning the endurance at closure with felt cost in tears. Elias as secondary applies pressure effectively via refusal. Minor stock phrasing in self-reflection slightly dulls specificity, but flaws do not touch pivotal delivery moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with strong because/therefore linkages, like the letter prompting the shop visit leading to the heart's repair and delivery; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands on-page with Elias's wrist grasp and echoed line, carrying emotional cost in tears and absolution. Orientation anchors early in the shop; one meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful details like cedar shavings and dusty light filter through Rowan's POV, with the shop constraining choices by providing tools for repair; environment charges final image via storm breaking like absolution. Sensory selection reflects urgency well, though some metaphors border on overt symbolism without harm to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of turning apology into action tightens causally through repair collaboration and delivery, narrowing options with Elias's initial refusal; agency in Rowan's decision to help and wind the key drives deepening, with felt cost in emotional vulnerability at climax. One meaningful intensification suffices, though secondary stakes feel lightly accented without dilution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness through action emerges organically from particulars like the heart's ticking hymn, offering resonant non-literal answer via final image of gears and dawn without moralizing; subtext in silences and implications enriches complexity. Ending reweights premise with conceptual cost of time's limits, avoiding tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with distinct perceptual signature in Rowan's biased noticing of mechanisms tied to regret; voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm under pressure like the vibrant hush. Dialogue natural and subtext-laden, advancing plot via echoes like "second opinions"; no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose dense and propulsive with vivid metaphors like spider-silk hairspring, varying rhythm naturally; high information density advances atmosphere and character without loops or scaffold, even in peak beats. Figurative language coherent and purposeful, charging closure without muddle; zero artifacts touch the ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of redemption via clockwork metaphor transforms trope through specific details like Elias's hospice toys and hymn; risk in poetic structure heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at wrist-grasp moment. No derivative echoes, with authentic vision cohering voice and theme.</comment>
