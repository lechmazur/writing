<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mender's motivation to mend generational rifts is clear and intensifies through embodied actions like climbing and grafting, rooted in her traded eye and forgotten bag; interiority is concrete, with contradictory impulses in her buckling heart at the grandmother's face. The daughter's feistiness pressures choices, forcing a crucible relationship that alters their state by tying wrists. Flaws complicate without hedging, and micro-choices reveal values with felt cost in the reconciliation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, patterned imagery and motifs build to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the singing and ribbon-tying, with conceptual cost in transforming the breach into "sweet rot that feeds next year’s bloom." Orientation anchors early in the nave stairs and cathedral; one meaningful deepening occurs via the graft and memory fruit. Closure lands on-page with undeniable pressure, shaped by persistent constraints like the bag's contents.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The abandoned cathedral with lush orchard is vividly specific, constraining choices like climbing branches and grafting wounds; sensory details like crunching glass and apricot sap reflect POV bias and urgency. The setting pressures the climax by supplying resources like fruit memories that charge the final image of descending with bowing branches. Micro-setting of the bag and ribbon integrates into action, evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mending the generational breach tightens through deepening imagery like the split graft and memory fruit, narrowing options under Accumulative/Textural lens; agency in singing lullabies crystallizes stance with visible emotional cost. One meaningful deepening suffices, with pressure coherent until reconfiguration. Moral calculus sharpens in choosing to graft wisdom over erasure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of generational wisdom as graft emerges organically from images like branches threading stone and ribbon binding, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in transformed breach. Subtext in silences and implications, like the fruit's sharp secrets, invites reflection; final image of petals as amendments offers resonant, non-literal answer reweighting the premise without statement. Emotional aftereffect is concrete through reconciliation's charged poise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with distinct perceptual signature in poetic noticing like "leaves whispered of the breach"; rhythmic control heightens in dappled light and wind rattles. Patterned elision in lyric mode is taught early and pays off at closure without obscurity. Dialogue is minimal but natural in the singing, advancing reconciliation with subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in metaphors like "green embroidery" and "scarlet thread" doing double work without muddle; no loops or artifacts obscure clarity. Information density high, sentences advance atmosphere and character, like the bag's contents spilling in the climax. Figurative language coherent and purposeful, accelerating momentum to the resonant end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy elements like memory-fruit and eye-traded skill transforms tropes into organic narrative via specific details like copper nails soldering bark; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on forgiveness, committing fully with bold imagery like "quartz lens flashed." Turns feel inevitable, as in the orchard exhaling fragrance.</comment>
