<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to archive her mother's memory is clear and intensifies through embodied actions like matching heartbeats, revealing contradictory impulses in her fierce claiming of sorrow as fuel; interiority is concrete, with emotions embodied in pulse echoes and throat tightening, earning the final endurance with felt cost of the garden's loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of petals and resonance, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara internalizes the memory with conceptual cost of isolation translated to independence; orientation anchors early in the velvet garden at twilight; closure lands on-page with the garden dissolving and her steps forward, though one minor elision in path rearrangement slightly softens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The velvet garden is vividly specific, with moonlit petals and neural soil constraining Mara's choices and charging the final image of the lingering petal winking out; sensory details like scents and shadows integrate into action, mirroring her internal blur of boundaries; environment evolves causally as blossoms dim, directly shaping the closure's radiance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of archiving before dawn signals early and deepens through heartbeat matching, narrowing options with each petal loosening; under textural lens, cadence shifts reweight isolation's cost, felt in the garden's shudder; one meaningful tightening suffices, though coincidence of the lectern's appearance slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory as translatable archive emerges organically from images like unfolding dances and falling petals, offering resonant ambiguity in forgetting-remembering partnership without moralizing; subtext in gestures like cupped hands reweights the premise in the final image, eliciting emotional aftereffect of fierce independence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual signature in Mara's biased noticing of vivid colors and murmurs; voice texture is distinctively poetic, with rhythmic syntax like "petals fell upward" modulating under pressure; patterned elision in resonance structures is taught early and pays off at closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere through vivid verbs like "guttered" and "winked"; rhythmic variety breathes in beats, though one paraphrase loop in the warning letters slightly drags; no major artifacts touch closure, and figurative language coheres without muddle in peak moments like the pale fire circle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of neural gardens and resonance shells transforms memory tropes through specific neural soil and heartbeat matching, feeling inevitable in the internal archive; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, offering fresh angle on quarantine as independence grammar.</comment>
