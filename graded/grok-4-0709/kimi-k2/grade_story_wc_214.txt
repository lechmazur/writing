<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cosmic janitor's motivation is clear and rooted in persistent curiosity, intensifying through embodied actions like tracing stars that leave scars, leading to an earned renunciation of strength for vulnerability with felt cost in his flickering pulse. Interiority is concrete and particular via metaphors like roots cracking stone, avoiding stock phrasing. No second character, so relationship bullets are ignored; single-POV interior contradiction shines in admitting the void while persisting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, image patterns build density to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where vulnerability reprices strength, with conceptual cost legible in the station's revival and his departure; orientation anchors early in the station's domes. One meaningful deepening suffices, as meteors veer and sprout, reweighting absence's ache. Minor elision in summoning feels motivated by pattern, not breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful details like cracked domes and brass gears mirror loneliness, constraining choices as he kneels on the cold floor; the station evolves causally, charging the final image of gears singing to light. Sensory hierarchy biases toward tactile hush and glowing scars, filtered through his spiritually curious POV. Micro-setting of the lantern glass and floorboards pressures the revival, elevating specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of alleviating cosmic loneliness tightens via textural density in tracing stars, narrowing options to admitting the void with felt cost in his scarred pulse and equalized heart; one deepening shift forces stance crystallization under Accumulative lens. Agency in renunciation earns the meteor seeds' sprouting without coincidence resolving. Moral calculus between resisting and embracing void sharpens the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability as doorway emerges organically from images like the healing fracture and darkness pouring in, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer where the universe thanks him, reweighting prior loneliness without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like barefoot walking and dust forming a hand invites reflection on empathy's cost. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding sentimentality in the primal smile.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, metaphor-driven noticing, like meteors as signatures; rhythmic control heightens in stillness beats without obscurity. No dialogue, so those bullets ignored; patterned elision in whispers and aches is taught early and pays off at closure. Prose texture reflects his mind, with syntax breathing like held notes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in concise, multi-job sentences like the lantern's tremor holding a song; no loops, scaffold, or muddled metaphors, with varied rhythm passing read-aloud test. Figurative language coheres without overwriting, as in gears singing like molten glass, advancing atmosphere under pressure. Final line resolves by recharging the lantern as a beating heart, with zero artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of janitor as empathetic listener transforms cosmic tropes through specific images like meteor seeds and dust constellations, feeling inevitable in the vulnerability repricing; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry. No echoes of famous scenes; authenticity coheres in primal-elegant tone. One non-obvious inflection in meteors landing as seeds elevates ingenuity.</comment>
