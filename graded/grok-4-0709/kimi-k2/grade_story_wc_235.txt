<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied contradictions, like feral nostalgia clawing at ribs, driving micro-choices under pressure; jealousy of past/future selves creates authentic tension, earning the final renunciation of hoarded words with visible cost in the burning scroll.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned imagery of scrolls and selves to a resonant reconfiguration at the ending, with conceptual cost in peeled years; orientation anchors early in the cabin with scroll and photo, but minor elision in timeline blending slightly softens causality without breaking closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory details like wind-scraped pine needles and tannin-tasting bark integrate into action; the cabin as micro-setting constrains choices, tilting and softening to enable soaring, charging the final dawn-bleeding image with atmospheric resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconciling chronological confusion tightens through blood-on-bark deepening, forcing stance crystallization in flight; agency in shouting across wind and letting scroll burn forecloses hoarding with felt cost, though coincidence of flame complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of embracing chaos over controlled narrative emerges organically from recurring scroll motifs and self-confrontations, culminating in a resonant, non-literal repricing via ash and fresh bark; subtext in mirror dialogue and star names invites lingering ambiguity without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with rhythmic control in metaphors like "spilled mercury" and patterned elision taught early, paying off in soaring sequence; close third-person POV stays consistent, with dialogue subtext advancing goals naturally in selves' exchanges.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in vivid lines like "ash spiraled upward, each flake a word she had hoarded," with varied rhythm and no loops; figurative language intensifies without muddle, though dense metaphors in flight beat approach overwriting but serve pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lucid dreaming and self-jealousy transforms familiar time motifs through specific surreal elements like weathered signature and charred scroll edges; bold risk in nonlinear flight heightens stakes, feeling inevitable at "let the bark burn."</comment>
