<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The oracle's motivation to map endless night is clear and intensifies through her obsessive tracing of silences, with embodied emotion in her trembling heartbeat and fingers smudging gold dust. Interiority is concrete and particular, showing contradictory impulses like vast simplicity amid textured absences, culminating in an earned stasis where she accepts the night's arrival with felt cost. The single-POV focus excels without needing secondary characters, though flaws are minimal and don't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through layered silences toward a resonant reconfiguration where the map glows in absolute darkness, with conceptual cost in the star's snuffing and future traveler's guidance. Orientation anchors early with the oracle climbing the ridge fort. Closure lands on-page with the booklet laid on the altar and hush contracting, charging the final image without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The storm-tossed ridge fort constrains choices, with wind clawing parapets and stones remembering sieges, while the ambered hush in the courtyard provides a sculptural quiet that charges the mapping. Sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, like wet cedar ink and salt-scented hush, evolving causally to deepen atmosphere. The setting's micro-elements, like the parapet edge and altar, directly shape the closure by absorbing echoes and sealing the map.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping endless night escalates through accumulative deepening of silences, with one meaningful cadence shift as the dot spreads to black, narrowing options and forcing conceptual repricing of night. Pressure coheres under textural lens, with felt cost in the star's obedience and oracle's trembling legs. Coincidence like lightning complicates but doesn't resolve; agency in her deliberate steps and whisper earns the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of capturing unsayable silences emerges organically through images like spiraling gold flakes and the obsidian mirror, inviting reflection on memory and forgetting without tidy morals. Subtext in gestures, like tearing her sleeve for a legend, reweights the premise with ambiguity. The final image of the glowing map in darkness offers a resonant, non-literal answer to guiding through endless night.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in textured silences like "velvet dark behind closed eyelids," and rhythmic control in varying syntax that heightens pressure. Prose texture is distinct, with purposeful compression in lyric descriptions taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through images like "ambered hush clung like resin around a fossilized bee," without loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies naturally, with syntactic variety supporting momentum, and metaphors cohere without muddle in peak beats like the dot's pulsing spread. Clarity is strong, with no artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing oracle mapping silences into a guide for endless night, transforming trope of prophetic vision through specific, textured hush and gold-flake vows. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the star's snuffing. Fresh inflection in the conceptual repricing avoids stock metaphors.</comment>
