<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The traveler's motivation to heal through mapping absences is clear and intensifies via micro-choices like writing in air and tying the thread, revealing contradictory impulses of resurrection versus rehearsing loss; interiority is embodied in tactile acts like warming the thread, though some epiphanies border on over-articulated. Emotions contradict realistically, as in the warmth of recognition amid dissolution, earning the final renunciation with felt cost. Single-POV focus excels without needing relationship dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through layered memories and images toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where the traveler reweights her own absence, with undeniable conceptual cost in the lantern-like splendor she carries; orientation anchors early in the garden post-ship. One meaningful deepening via the thread's glow and flowers suffices, holding the lens without contradiction. Persistent memory constraint shapes the final image, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The shadowed autumn garden is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like bronze light and quince scent filtering through POV bias to mirror grief; it constrains choices, as the dry fountain and path enable the ritual, charging the closure with the thread on the nymph. Environment evolves causally, from rust leaves to glowing words dissolving into dusk, constraining the final walk.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of healing absence tightens through textural density increase in writing rites, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in shrinking loss; agency via renunciation drives deepening, as thread-laying forecloses reversal. Coherent pressure reweights options under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving. Cost is unmistakable in the self-obituary realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of geography of healing emerges organically from ritual acts and images like moth-face outline, offering resonant non-literal answer in the coastline metaphor without moralizing; subtext in silences and implications deepens complexity. Final image reweights absence as navigable, eliciting emotional aftereffect of lonesome hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, sensory noticing like obituary-leaves; rhythmic control heightens under pressure, as in faster writing. Patterned elision in lyric mode is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid metaphors like "sky unbuttoned its stars" advancing atmosphere; zero loops or scaffold, though figurative density borders overwriting in peak beats without muddle. Rhythm varies naturally, supporting momentum to the final line's resonant image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief ritual with stolen thread and air-writing feels inevitable, transforming memory tropes through specific tactile projections; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry. Non-obvious angle on absence as sail-able country elevates ingenuity.</comment>
