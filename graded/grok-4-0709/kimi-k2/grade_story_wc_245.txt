<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to dowse emotional depths is clear and intensifies through embodied sensations like vibrations soaking into pores, revealing contradictory impulses in her grief and determination. Interiority is concrete, with emotions embodied in heat, texture, and direction, culminating in an earned recognition at the stillpoint where she names grief, foreclosing denial with felt cost. The single-POV focus excels in showing internal conflict via micro-choices, like pressing the ring to the ground, without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered sensory details and vibrations, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration at the stillpoint with conceptual cost in naming grief and reweighting her self-perception. Orientation anchors early with the blind mapmaker in the ultrasonic forest at night, serving the accumulative payoff. Closure lands on-page with the melody settling in her ribcage, reconfiguring her as a living chart, though one minor elision in emotional transition slightly softens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest is vividly specific with high-pitched leaves, quartz trunks humming like tuning forks, and musical notes as silver droplets, constraining choices like barefoot navigation via moss braille. Sensory details are purposeful, balancing touch and sound to reflect the protagonist's blindness and urgency, charging the final image where the forest's melody integrates into her body. The setting evolves causally, mirroring her internal states without overt symbolism, and anchors spatial choreography coherently.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of navigating uncharted emotional depths tightens accumulatively through denser notes and the melody's salt-cedar taste, culminating in naming grief as a deepening that reweights options with emotional cost. One meaningful cadence shift at the stillpoint forces stance crystallization, foreclosing prior avoidance. Agency via renunciation is earned, though coincidence in the forest's response slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of self-mapping emotional depths emerges organically from images like absorbed languages and the platinum ring's inward point, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in grief's acceptance. Subtext in gestures like palm-pressing and barefoot steps invites reflection on loss and recognition. The final image of becoming a living chart offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without stated moral, eliciting honest aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward tactile and auditory details fitting the blind protagonist, modulating rhythmically under pressure like the hush revealing her heartbeat. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax and word choice, teaching patterned elision early and paying off at closure without head-hopping. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation there.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid metaphors like "vibrations soaked into her pores like ink," varying rhythm naturally and avoiding loops, though one mixed metaphor ("quiet blaze warming the night air") slightly muddles in a peak beat. Clarity and concision advance atmosphere without scaffold, and final line recharges motifs effectively. Information density is high, with sentences multitasking character and setting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of a blind mapmaker dowsing emotions in an ultrasonic forest synthesizes fresh elements like skin-absorbed languages and a grief-completing melody, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes of loss through specific sensory worldview. Originality shines in the non-obvious inward compass, committing fully to implications.</comment>
