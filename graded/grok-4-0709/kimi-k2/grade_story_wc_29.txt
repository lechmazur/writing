<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation as a reluctant guardian is clear and intensifies through her counter-signal composition, rooted in her mentor's dying words that compel her high-stakes interference; interiority is concrete with embodied caution, like sweating palms and trembling fingers, revealing contradictory hope and fear without stock phrasing. The final endurance forecloses passive observation with felt cost in her slump and the transmitter's flare, earning the resolution. Minor slip in over-articulated self-awareness mid-crisis slightly flattens emotional contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure links beats through because/therefore motivations, from signal detection to counter-signal deployment and mirrored retaliation, culminating in an on-page Decisive Change where the tricksters' wave convulses and the comet softens, with visible cost in overheated circuitry and Lyra's exhaustion. Orientation anchors who (Lyra), where (basement studio), and when (night of marches) by the first paragraph. Persistent constraint of subsonic frequencies shapes tactics, charging the final image of the quiet lullaby drifting out.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The university radio station basement is vividly anchored with solder-ozone smells and glowing tubes, constraining choices through its antique transmitter that enables but risks overload during the climax. Astronomical charts as recurring objects charge the final image by trembling then steadying, mirroring the resolution. Sensory details like copper smells and dimming lights evolve causally, reflecting pressure without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><grade>Under Causal lens, dominant stake of preventing community division escalates through meaningful tightening when tricksters retaliate with a counter-counter-song, narrowing options and raising cost via the transmitter's flare and Lyra's phase-shift calculation. Agency drives the mirrored signal as a renunciation of passivity, foreclosing inaction with on-page cost in circuitry overload. One deepening suffices, with moral calculus between hope and weaponized lullaby sharpening the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting fear into vigilance emerges through images like the comet's apologetic tail and the town's softened marches, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the tricksters' potential return. Subtext in subsonic whispers and lullaby fragments invites reflection on manipulation without direct statements. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to interference's cost, reweighting the premise of cosmic games.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Lyra's biased noticing of signals as "silky oscillation that tasted like burnt sugar," modulating rhythm under pressure without head-hopping. Prose texture distinct in rhythmic metaphors and syntax that breathes with intensity, like short sentences during the fader push. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; elision of off-page town reactions is taught and paid off through her monitoring.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with multipurpose lines, like "spooling magnetic tape like black water" advancing action, atmosphere, and theme without loops or scaffold; syntactic variety propels momentum, varying openings and lengths for rhythm. No artifacts in peak beats, with clean grammar and strong verbs; final line resolves by recharging the lullaby motif with ethereal grit. Hairline slip in one mixed metaphor ("ghost sliding into a possessed body") doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of subsonic alien manipulation with radio interference feels inevitable, transforming sci-fi tropes through Lyra's lullaby composition from heartbeats and Earth signals, heightening stakes without gimmickry. Bold risk in ethereal grit tone commits to premise implications, offering fresh angle on division via cosmic puppeteers. Non-obvious final reconfiguration of the comet's tail as apologetic elevates ingenuity.</comment>
