<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to discover meaning in unlearning is clear and intensifies through embodied actions like tracing spirals and pressing her palm over the tile, revealing character under pressure with consistent traits. Interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions embodied in trembling fingers and soundless laughter, avoiding stock phrasing. However, internal conflict lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, trending toward poetic summary rather than raw friction, slightly softening the emotional progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and motif accrual, with orientation anchored early in the whispering grotto during unlearning. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration via Conceptual Repricing, where the mandala's completion and external sharing reweight unlearning as permission with felt cost in dissolved memories, evident in the lavender-stained sand. One meaningful deepening suffices, as chalk erosion and hush folding charge the final image without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The grotto setting is vivid and purposeful, with lilac mist and sighing breath constraining choices like coaxing hush into shapes, directly charging the final image of the mandala sealed under mist. Sensory details are selective, balancing visual and tactile elements filtered through POV bias, evolving causally as mist rearranges into silhouettes. Environment pressures the protagonist's actions, such as the tile flake vibrating from the ceiling, making it indispensable to the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of discovering meaning in unlearning escalates through pattern breaks like the tile's murmurs and hush folding into a blossom, with one meaningful deepening reweighting the stake via permission in erasure. Cost is legible in released memories dissolving into pigment, foreclosing past burdens with felt relief. Agency manifests in endurance and drawing, crystallizing stance without needing multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of unlearning as permissive emergence arises organically from concrete actions like widening the mandala and hearing the lover's promise, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in relief-tinted unease. Subtext operates in images like moth wings and lavender stains, eliciting emotional aftereffect through resonant complexity. The final image of passersby adding lines offers a non-literal answer to meaning in mess, reweighting prior material without assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in socially perceptive antennae and biased noticing of hush as audience, modulating rhythm with emotional intensity in soundless laughter. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax and rhythm, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; elision pays off in hush's grammar without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through multi-job lines like "fingers trembling with the unlearning" without loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies naturally, with syntactic variety supporting propulsion in spirals and crescents; metaphors cohere without muddle, as in mist tinting bruise-purple. Minor figurative density in peak beats is pattern-taught and pays off at closure, avoiding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise of unlearning via mandala patterns in a living grotto offers fresh synthesis, transforming erasure tropes through specific details like the vibrating tile flake recounting forgotten promises. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the external mandala drawing. Emotional specificity in permissive relief avoids generics, cohering as singular vision.</comment>
