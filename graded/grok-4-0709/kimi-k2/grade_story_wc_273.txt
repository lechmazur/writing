<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alba's motivation is clear and rooted in her serene anger, intensifying to compel her pursuit of answers, with embodied emotions like chest tightening showing contradictory impulses under pressure; her albino physiology provides a specific blind spot that enables her immunity to panic, driving the closure choice to step through the doorway with visible cost in transforming her anger to determination.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern breaks in ink swirls reweighting knowledge toward closure; orientation anchors early in the wind-carved encampment post-eclipse, and the resonant reconfiguration at the end delivers a conceptual repricing of time with felt cost in the researchers' eternal terror, though one minor ellipsis in the researchers' vanishing slightly softens causality without breaking the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment is vividly anchored with warm sandstone walls and shifting chambers that constrain Alba's pursuit, charging the final doorway image; sensory details like pale light and uphill-flowing ink are selective and POV-biased, mirroring her calm amid crisis without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering temporal truths escalates through accumulative pattern shifts in the ink, tightening to a meaningful deepening when the drone maps doorways, forcing stance crystallization with legible cost in the suspended researchers' terror; under the textural lens, one decisive intensification suffices, though coincidence in the eclipse complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of consciousness shaping time emerges organically from ink patterns and realizations, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer at closure where serenity conquers crisis without moralizing; subtext in the drone's rhythm and Alba's anger adds complexity, inviting reflection on mercy versus malice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in Alba's tracker instincts and serene anger, modulating rhythm under pressure; brief dialogue at the end carries subtext and advances the thematic resolution naturally, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in patterns like the ink's spirals without loops or scaffold; metaphors like "cold fire" are controlled and purposeful, propelling toward closure, though one simultaneity in the drone's dipping could be tighter but doesn't obscure the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of temporal ink and hummingbird drone transforms sci-fi tropes through Alba's specific anger and realizations, heightening stakes with bold conceptual risk in crisis dilation without gimmickry; the non-obvious angle on time as mercy feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
