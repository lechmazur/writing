<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as a persistently curious tracer is clear and intensifies through her choice to listen and speak for the dead, embodying contradictory impulses of fear and heroism in the moment she kneels before the old man. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with emotions like the tracer's hum as a second pulse revealing her under pressure without stock phrasing. The resolution earns her incidental heroism by confronting flaws in the city's negligence, with a felt cost in the heavier photograph symbolizing ongoing burden.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered voices and messages, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the atrium brightens and ghosts fade, with conceptual cost in Mara's promise to carry stories onward. Orientation anchors early in the mist-clad atrium at twilight, and causality holds via motivated pulses guiding her actions. The closure reweights her role with undeniable pressure, though a minor ellipsis in the ghosts' gathering slightly softens linkage before the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is vividly sensory, with wet marble, old roses, and cracked tiles constraining Mara's path and mirroring the ghosts' tethering, charging the final image as the space brightens and empties. Details like toppled urns and sunless vines evolve with her movement, filtered through her curious POV, and the environment pressures choices by guiding the tracer's needle. Sensory hierarchy narrows under urgency, with the reeling hush modulating to exhale, supporting thematic resonance without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of mapping unacknowledged grief escalates through gathering ghosts and urgent pulses, tightening in the cadence shift as Mara speaks messages, forcing her stance crystallization with the cost of perpetual readiness. One meaningful deepening occurs when the old man's recognition reweights names and memories, narrowing options to her vow. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolving, though the accumulation feels slightly repetitive before the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of incidental heroism protecting vulnerable voices emerges organically from Mara's actions and the ghosts' unfinished stories, with subtext in silences and images like the quivering photograph reweighting memory's cost. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by repricing her curiosity as a bridge between worlds, embracing complexity without tidy morals. Emotional aftereffect lingers through her heavier pocket and warm tracer, earned via specific struggles like repeating the nurse's plea.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with Mara's perceptual signature in device-focused noticing like the tracer's hum and moth-wing pulses, modulating rhythm under pressure without head-hopping. Voice texture is distinct in lyrical syntax and purposeful compression, teaching patterned elision in ghost dialogues that carry subtext and advance the accumulation. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, as in the old man's cracking voice pursuing his name, with indirection heightening implication over declaration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like "soft as moth wings: Help us" that advance atmosphere and momentum without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, such as "damp velvet" folding around them, enhancing propulsion in peak beats without muddle. Minor artifact in one repetitive stem ("she" openings in ghost sequence) slightly dulls but doesn't touch closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise of a heart tracer hearing the dead's longing offers fresh synthesis, transforming ghost tropes through specific devices like the rewired hearing aid and incidental heroism arising from curiosity. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes via layered voices without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the vow that recharges the photograph. Emotional specificity in forgotten names avoids generics, though the conservatory setting echoes familiar haunted spaces slightly.</comment>
