<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to uncover the withheld truth is clear and intensifies through embodied interiority, with contradictory impulses evident in her encounters with alternate selves; the final renunciation of the shard earns its cost by foreclosing cyclical wandering, visible in her lighter steps and new mapping. Strengths include concrete sensory details revealing character under pressure, avoiding stock phrasing. The pilot revelation moment anchors the hierarchy of values with genuine emotional contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elisions and rearrangements to a Resonant Reconfiguration, with the shard's embedding providing Charged Poise and conceptual cost in released weight; orientation anchors early in the repair bay without debt. Strengths lie in motif recurrence charging the closure without redundancy, though minor ellipsis in universe shifts slightly softens causality at the console reveal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport's rusting gantries and oil-stained deck vividly anchor atmosphere, with sensory details like ozone taste mirroring Lira's internal regret; the setting constrains choices, such as the crack in the floor charging the final image. Micro-setting via the shard functions as environment, evolving causally to reweight the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering the withheld truth tightens through the console revelation, deepening knowledge with felt cost in tears and released breath; under Accumulative lens, pattern breaks like the shard's pulsing escalate pressure coherently. One meaningful deepening suffices, but coincidence in meeting alternate Liras slightly complicates without fully resolving, keeping agency in Lira's final redirection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of interwoven truths across realities emerges organically from shard motifs and pilot's memory, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the embedded glass repricing silence's cost; subtext in gestures like fist-closing carries implication without direct statement. The final image invites lingering ambiguity on cyclical journeys without confusion, avoiding tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in sensory mapping, like tasting metal memories; lyrical voice modulates rhythm under pressure, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; purposeful compression pays off in the hush between heartbeats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, propulsion-driven sentences like "the bay folded like paper," varying rhythm naturally without loops or artifacts; information layers advance atmosphere and character simultaneously, passing read-aloud test. Figurative language integrates cleanly in peak beats, such as ozone chord, enhancing clarity at closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of parallel universes via a cyclically spontaneous shard transforms multiverse tropes through sensory cartography and withheld truths, feeling inevitable in the pilot's flung memory; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The console revelation offers a fresh inflection on identity cycles, committing fully to premise implications.</comment>
