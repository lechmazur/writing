<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to reclaim feeling through ritual is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in her embodied loss of vibration sense, with emotions shown contradictorily in her tears and remembered joy during the drum strike. Garrick's secondary pressure via signing and tapping heightens her choices, making relationships a crucible that alters her state by the end. The final renunciation of numbness feels earned with visible cost in the peeled layers, though interiority occasionally leans on summary rather than simultaneous impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery of hush and reversal, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara's regained sensation reweights her numbness with felt emotional cost in tears and dissolved shards. Orientation anchors early in the cavern with Mara's arrival, and one meaningful deepening occurs via the drum's creation and strike, advancing knowledge without causality breaks. The ending's conceptual repricing of silence as fertile space lands on-page, though some ritual steps feel more elliptical than pressured.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cavern setting is vivid and purposeful, with resin, cedar, and curving walls constraining the ritual and charging the final hush inhalation, while micro-details like the workbench and hides mirror Mara's internal tightening. Sensory hierarchy reflects her deafness, prioritizing vibration through soles and palms, evolving causally as the drum absorbs tears without echo. The faint rustle of seasons integrates action, brushing cheeks like applause to heighten atmospheric resonance at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake of defeating numbness escalates through textural density in the ritual, with one meaningful deepening when the hush filament enters Mara, narrowing options and forcing a trade-off of grief for gratitude with visible cost in tears. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, crystallizing her stance via the drum strike, though coincidence in the hush's effect slightly complicates without fully resolving. Agency shines in her threading the needle and striking, interweaving internal conflict authentically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of silence as a fertile space for regrowth emerges organically from images like the hush filament and backward songs, culminating in a resonant final image of moonlight on the drum without stated morals. Subtext in gestures like tapping and signing invites reflection on embodied listening, with emotional aftereffect earned through Mara's tears and dream. Complexity avoids tidiness, embracing ambiguity in rewound grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward vibrations and signed communication, modulating rhythmically under pressure like the slow-rising hush. Signing functions as goal-driven dialogue with subtext, advancing the ritual without direct speech. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax, teaching patterned elision early and paying off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally in beats like the drum strike, where sentences propel through vivid images without loops or scaffold. Figurative language, such as hush as smoke, integrates purposefully without muddle, supporting momentum. Minor register drift in elevated metaphors during peak moments slightly dulls immediacy, but closure remains clear and propelled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise of rewinding grief via a hush filament in a drum offers fresh synthesis of deafness and ritual, transforming tropes like healing quests through specific vibrational embodiment. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the backward images. Emotional specificity avoids generics, though some cavern motifs echo familiar fantasy without full subversion.</comment>
