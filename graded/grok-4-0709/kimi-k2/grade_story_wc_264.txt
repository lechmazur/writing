<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The guard's motivation to cultivate discarded sparks is clear and intensifies through choices like planting the clock, rooted in traits like dreamlessness, with interiority concrete via hummed lullabies and felt probabilities; however, emotions feel more abstract than embodied, lacking contradictory impulses in peak moments like the archive confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned imagery like ticking clocks and blooming dunes, with orientation anchored early in the glowing dune; closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration via the pollinating forest and humming continent, with felt cost in the archive's folding and midnight's weight, though the incomplete final sentence slightly dilutes cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The glowing dune in bloom vividly anchors setting with phosphorescent blossoms whispering names, evolving causally as sprouts rise from embers, constraining choices like stepping through the mirage; sensory details are selective and POV-biased, charging the final forest image, though spatial choreography in the corridor feels momentarily abstract.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of cultivating sparks escalates texturally through pattern breaks like the clock's impossible tick and archive's gift, tightening via the guard's agency in pressing the spark, with legible cost in unmaking the archive; one meaningful deepening suffices, but coincidence in the mirage door slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming erased futures emerges organically from motifs like pruned names and seeded embers, culminating in resonant final line "The sparks you seek are the dreams you guard" that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in archive's smile and gifted memory invites reflection, though some ambiguity borders on obscurity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in pulsing sand and humming probabilities, prose texture rhythmic and purposeful in fractured lullabies; dialogue is natural, subtextual, advancing plot in the archive's offer, with patterned elision taught early and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in blooming vines and shivering dunes, free of loops or scaffold; metaphors like pages of light are coherent and propel momentum, though occasional overwriting in "occasionally everywhere" slightly muddles in peak beats without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surreal elements like divergent archive and probability tides transforms tropes of loss and guardianship into non-obvious guardianship wave function, with risk in lyric structure heightening stakes; however, echoes of dreamlike quests feel somewhat familiar without full transformation.</comment>
