<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to adapt the artifact's grief is clear and intensifies through her logically emotional traits, compelling her to hum and guide vibrations in a pivotal on-page choice that forecloses silence with the cost of physical numbness and the key's transformation. Interiority is concrete, with embodied contradictions like her heart wincing while calculating frequencies, avoiding stock phrasing. The crypt keeper's secondary pressure is immediate and relevant, forcing the ritual's completion. Flaws complicate choices authentically, as her competence balances genuine struggle without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through patterned sonic and visual elisions to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the artifact's wail becomes a lullaby, with felt costs like the melted key and numb knees legible in the final images. Orientation anchors who (Lira), where (drift-ice marina), and when (fleeting golden sunset) by the first paragraph, avoiding penalties. Closure lands on-page with a conceptual repricing of grief into peace, shaped by persistent sonic constraints. Minor ellipsis in the crypt keeper's vanishing feels motivated but slightly under-motivates the beacon's self-relighting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is vividly specific, with sensory details like creaking gangways and groaning ice integrated into action, constraining Lira's choices by conducting sorrow differently and becoming a resonant chamber in the climax. Atmosphere evolves causally, from shimmering floes to glowing cathedral, mirroring her internal shift and charging the final blue dark with song. Micro-setting of the ice as a throat directly enables the vibrational matching, fulfilling the 9+ test by constraining the ritual and charging closure. Tone tensions the fleshly ethereal concept purposefully through tactile, lived-in navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of protecting the artifact from drowning the world in grief tightens through one meaningful deepening when Lira hums to match pitches, narrowing options and forcing a trade-off with the key's melting as a visible cost. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation reads as density increase in sonic patterns, reweighting stakes via the ice's transformation without coincidence resolving. Agency crystallizes in her guiding voice, earning the reconfiguration, though internal-external weave is optional and lightly present. Moral calculus sharpens the choice between silencing and translating grief, with ethical cost in release over imprisonment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of translating grief into bearable form emerges organically from sonic images and the artifact's weep, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer where the marina sings forgiveness, reweighting prior sorrow without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like the key's song and melted teeth implies protection through release, inviting reflection on loneliness via purposeful ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars like the lullaby cradling a child, avoiding sentimentality. The final image of the beam scattering sunset seeds offers a CR that integrates with the core concept, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV on Lira is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward sonic and visual details like audible colors, modulating rhythm under pressure without head-hopping. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, patterned diction that teaches lyric compression early, paying off at closure with legible effect under the lens. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; free indirect style is clean, with psychic distance shifting intentionally for emotional beats. Non-standard punctuation in metaphors is consistent and voice-motivated, enhancing fleshly ethereal tone without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with vivid metaphors like "ice conducts sorrow differently" advancing atmosphere, but occasional overwriting in peak beats, such as stacked sunset descriptions, muddles clarity slightly without harming closure. Rhythm varies naturally, passing read-aloud test, though some paraphrase loops like repeated "fleeting golden sunset" trigger a minor -0.4 artifact penalty. Sentences multitask effectively, with strong verbs and specific nouns, but figurative density in the ritual scene borders on excess, deducting -0.3 for coherence. No major loops or scaffolds obscure cause/effect, and final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise of a weeping sonic artifact translated via ice vibrations offers a fresh synthesis of maritime fantasy and acoustic engineering, feeling inevitable through Lira's logically emotional lens and heightening stakes with bold sonic risks. Tropes like the key and lighthouse are transformed via specific, grounded choices, such as the key singing and melting, avoiding stock echoes. Originality shines in the fleshly ethereal tone, with ingenuity in adapting grief into a lullaby that reconfigures meaning organically. Risk-taking in lyric patterning elevates coherence without gimmickry, earning +0.3 within band.</comment>
