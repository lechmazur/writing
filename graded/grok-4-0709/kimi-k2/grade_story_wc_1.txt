<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to retrace her mentor's path is clear and intensifies through embodied interiority, like pressing the ledger strip and fitting the shard, revealing contradictory impulses between vengeance and remembrance; the final renunciation earns its cost with tears blurring the projection, showing visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images like frost and glass to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the protagonist realizes purpose in remembrance, with felt cost in tears and unresolved "carry the"; orientation anchors early in the first sentence, and one meaningful deepening via the projection suffices for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The quiet canyon under stars is vividly specific, with moonlight-glazed walls and frost patterns constraining choices like following feathers north, charging the final projection on walls; this micro-setting integration elevates atmosphere without excess, mirroring her fragile silhouette.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering purpose tightens through one deepening via frost patterns leading to the kiln's ghost, forcing stance crystallization under textural pressure; cost is legible in emotional tears and foreclosed vengeance, though coincidence of finding shards complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of purpose in pauses emerges organically from motifs like mentor's traced pattern and frost fractures, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the projected ledger revealing betrayals; subtext in images like trapped starlight avoids moralizing, inviting reflection on memory over vengeance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, biased noticing like frost as map; rhythmic control in drifting resonance heightens without obscurity, as in the river's whisper like applause; no dialogue, but voice coherence shines in lines like "sleep was a shallow pool."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like the luminous shard fusing and flaring; zero loops or artifacts, high information density in metaphors like canyon walls as dark mirrors, and clarity peaks in the projection's living geometry without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glass artistry with smuggling and frost divination transforms tropes through specific motifs like the kiln's ghost exhaling steam; risk in lyric accumulation heightens resonance without gimmickry, as in the mentor's prophecy becoming inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
