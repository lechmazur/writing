<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as a defunct revolutionary is clear and intensifies through her poetic translations, showing embodied internal conflict in her fear of visible time revealing betrayal; contradictory impulses act in scene, like draping mirrors while studying the shard, earning the final renunciation of ownership with visible sorrow as cost. Solenne's secondary pressure forces a stance shift, and Mara's flaws complicate choices without hedging. The hierarchy of values reveals in micro-choices, such as showing verses to Solenne, leading to collaborative archaeology.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned reflections and visions, with orientation anchored early in the baroque asteroid's ballroom; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when the vase heals and mirrors show constellations, reweighting time with conceptual cost of transformed sorrow, though one ellipsis in the enforcers' arrival slightly softens causality. A persistent constraint of visible time shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting is vivid and purposeful, with mirrors and chronal storms constraining choices like covering reflections during crises; sensory details filter through Mara's bias, evolving causally as the palace becomes a seed ship, charging the final image of reimagined constellations. Micro-setting of the shard and mirrors directly shapes the closure reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reimagining the civilization escalates through accumulative density of visions and storms, deepening when Solenne confronts Mara, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in shared sorrow; under Textural lens, pattern break at midnight readings narrows options, though coincidence of enforcers listening complicates without resolving. Agency drives the tightening via Mara's translations, making cost unmistakable in the healed vase's handover.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of stewardship over ownership emerges organically from shard visions and translations, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in sorrow's transformation; the final image of the asteroid as seed ship offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of time and history without stated moral. Subtext in mirrors and black velvet deepens complexity, eliciting emotional aftereffect through concrete particulars like the etched poem.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with rhythmic control in phrases like "bruise-colored ribbon," maintaining perceptual signature through Mara's biased noticing of time and sorrow; dialogue carries subtext and advances plot naturally, as in Mara's "I'm translating" line pursuing persuasion. Patterned elision in visions is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and no loops or artifacts; metaphors like "sorrow grew like orchids" are coherent and heighten pressure without muddle, doing double duty in beats. Final line recharges motifs cleanly, with high information density in visions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sci-fi archaeology with poetic reimagination feels inevitable, transforming tropes like corporate greed through specific details like visible time and floating gardens; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise with fresh inflection in the healed vase's role.</comment>
