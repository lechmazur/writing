<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation rooted in grief is clear and intensifies through embodied actions like pressing the censer foot to her sternum, compelling her to build despite initial resistance; interiority is concrete with contradictory impulses, such as ignoring calls but folding under loss's map. Emotions are embodied in pulses matching moon phases and blood sizzling on bronze, revealing values with cost in the crossing. The brother's echo applies secondary pressure, altering her stance by the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned midnight calls and riddle coordinates, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where she crosses into solace with felt cost in blood and searing; orientation anchors early with the barefoot navigator on cracked concrete. Closure lands on-page with the bronze cooling steadily, reweighting absence into presence. One meaningful deepening suffices, with starlight pooling as a pattern break charging the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The starlit signal station is vividly anchored with cracked concrete, frozen dishes, and moonlit river, constraining choices like aligning pieces by starlight; sensory details like warmth seeping from ground and bronze's heat reflect POV bias and urgency. The micro-setting of the dish's concave face charges the closure by trembling and forming the cradle-bridge. Environment evolves causally, mirroring internal grief through tactile navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of navigating grief to reverse loss tightens through accumulative pressure of calls and builds, deepening in the seventh night's cradle that forecloses ignoring the voice; agency in soldering and crossing incurs visible cost like cut palms and searing bronze. Under textural lens, cadence shifts with moon phases reweight stakes without needing multiple reversals. Moral calculus between endurance and action sharpens the peak cross.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of grief as a navigable geography emerges through images like the cradle rocking backward and blood on bronze, offering resonant ambiguity in reverse migration as memory's return without tidy morals. Subtext in riddles and brother's eyes holding unfound nights invites reflection on loss's cost. Final image of cool, steady bronze reprices the premise non-literally, eliciting emotional aftereffect of raw solace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable with perceptual signature in moon-tied pulses and starlight alignment, modulating rhythm to heighten emotional intensity like the dish trembling. Voice texture is distinct in poetic syntax and patterned elision, taught early and paid off at closure without confusion. Dialogue in cryptic whispers advances plot with subtext, pursuing the build goal indirectly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm in lines like "the moon hung thin as a paper cut," advancing atmosphere without loops; figurative language is controlled, avoiding muddle in peaks like blood sizzling. Clarity holds with strong verbs and specific nouns, though minor synonym proximity in heat descriptions exists but doesn't obscure closure. Final line resolves by recharging the bronze motif effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi signal station with ritualistic grief navigation transforms tropes through specific details like moon-fluctuating bronze and riddle coordinates, feeling inevitable in the cradle-bridge. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise's implications in the crossing. Emotional complexity in raw solace avoids generics, with non-obvious angle on loss as reverse migration.</comment>
