<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysander's motivation to protect the secret language is clear and intensifies through risky actions like planting the seed, rooted in his rogue scholar traits; interiority is concrete via embodied choices, such as smiling to disarm the mimic on his collar. Emotions are contradictory and embodied, shown in his acceptance of the spark's potential to burn, avoiding stock phrasing. The meaningful endurance forecloses safer paths with felt cost, evident in the sirens' convergence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of plants and insects, with density increasing toward the warp's completion; orientation anchors early in the greenhouse at dusk. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via the gardens' unified exhale of defiance, with conceptual cost in the grafting spark and converging sirens. One meaningful cadence shift tightens the narrative, though minor elision in the mimic encounter slightly softens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting is vivid and purposeful, with humid air, insects, and plants constraining choices like hiding messages in leaves; sensory details reflect Lysander's urgency, such as the beetle's pheromones drifting like graffiti. The environment charges the final image, as gardens across the city exhale defiance, mirroring internal states through evolving glyphs. Micro-setting of the seed and soil integrates action seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of warping the language against Excise auditors signals early and tightens through the mimic's arrival and flicking it into the pitcher plant, narrowing options under Accumulative lens. Pressure coheres with one meaningful deepening, forcing stance crystallization amid sirens; cost is legible in the risk of capture, though coincidence in the beetle's timely recognition slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of defiant language resisting control emerges organically from plant metaphors and insect dialects, culminating in a resonant final image of gardens exhaling unparseable defiance without stated moral. Subtext in gestures like whispering to tomatoes invites reflection on freedom's cost. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward cryptic, living metaphors like roots as question marks; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax that modulates with pressure. Minimal dialogue feels natural and subtextual, as in murmuring to the mimic. Patterned elision teaches compression early and pays off at closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and high information density in lines like the seed splitting into a question-mark root; no loops or artifacts, metaphors coherent and voice-motivated. Clarity shines in peak beats, such as the warp accelerating with rippling glass. Final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of taxable thoughts and plant-based languages feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like pheromone graffiti; risk-taking in lyric density heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise commits fully, with non-obvious angle on defiance via gardens declaring independence.</comment>
