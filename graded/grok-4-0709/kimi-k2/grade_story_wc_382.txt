<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to learn the buildings' language is rooted in consistent curiosity and intensifies through micro-choices like pressing the seal, revealing internal contradictions in missing an unknown man; the widow's traits feel particular but secondary, applying pressure effectively. Emotions are embodied in the branding heat and seismic Morse, with flaws complicating choices without hedging. The final endurance carries a felt cost of changed perception, earning stasis. Voice distinction holds in the protagonist's introspective idiom versus the widow's enigmatic speech.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned motifs like the seal and wax, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the protagonist understands fluency as being spoken through, with undeniable conceptual cost in reweighted reality; orientation anchors early with the envelope and alley. Closure lands on-page with the wall's Morse and seal as promise, reconfiguring options. Persistent constraint of the tutor's ghostly presence shapes tactics subtly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rooftop garden during a meteor shower constrains choices by providing a space for interrogation and charges the final image with falling stars as syllables; sensory details like crushed lemon balm and bergamot are selective, POV-filtered, and evolve causally. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from kitchen to roof. Environment mirrors internal states through vibrating bricks and exhaling dust without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of learning the buildings' language escalates through pattern breaks like the seal's pressing and meteor shower, deepening with a cadence shift that reweights cost in mutual interrogation; one meaningful intensification suffices, forcing stance crystallization. Agency in endurance forecloses isolation with felt cost of branded memory. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of agreed-upon lies as the grammar of old buildings emerges organically from events like wax pressing and meteor sentences, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the tutor's tense change. Subtext in gestures like the seal's transfer invites reflection on fluency without confusion. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by repricing lies as enduring, charging emotional aftereffect through the wall's welcome.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable, with perceptual signature in building metaphors and biased noticing of scents like cedar; dialogue carries subtext, pursues goals like teaching lessons, and distinguishes characters through idiom. Patterned elision in poetic phrasing is taught early and pays off at closure without obscurity. Rhythmic control heightens under meteor pressure, with no head-hopping or register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through images like the lion's mane without loops or scaffold; syntax varies for rhythm, as in short meteor sentences contrasting longer reflections. Figurative language like buildings exhaling dust is coherent, voice-motivated, and propels momentum. Minor overwriting in peak beats like the branding avoids muddle, maintaining clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes ghostly inheritance and architectural language into a fresh angle on loss and fluency, transforming tropes through specific details like wax vibrations; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Turns like mutual interrogation feel inevitable from patterns. Authenticity coheres in a singular poetic stance.</comment>
