<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation to liberate the shard is clear and intensifies through embodied actions like dancing ciphers, revealing contradictory impulses in her calm defiance amid drowned secrets; interiority is concrete, with emotions shown via pulse and breath rather than labels. The final endurance forecloses paths with felt cost, as in pressing the shard to her sternum. Strengths in micro-choices under pressure elevate, but slight stock phrasing in "ticking like a metronome" limits to sub-9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, patterns of drips, dances, and glyphs build to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lyra emerges with the shard, reweighting vulnerability as strength with conceptual cost in the lab's surrender. Orientation anchors early in the glass corridor and flooded city. Closure lands on-page with the dice showing "I FORGIVE," but minor ellipsis in tidal pattern motivation slightly softens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory's vivid, sensory details—like dripping water, failing lamps, and spider silk—constrain choices, such as timing the dance with the web, and charge the final image of the balanced die. Micro-setting of the safe and cube integrates into action, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Environment shapes the closure by pressuring the tide's arrival, meeting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of liberating confessions escalates texturally through dance and spider timing, deepening to foreclose options with the jammed safe; agency in renunciation (leaving the dice) carries felt cost in exhaled defiance. One meaningful cadence shift suffices, but coincidence of spider's exact timing complicates without fully resolving, per lens. Pressure coheres but lacks a sharper trade-off at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of translating vulnerability into strength emerges through particulars like the shard's cold bite and folded cipher, culminating in a resonant final image without moralizing. Subtext in glyphs and dance invites reflection on drowned secrets. Emotional aftereffect lingers via ambiguity, but some overt metaphors like "pain rewritten as architecture" border on statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in selective noticing of hums and drips, modulated rhythm heightening pressure in dance sequences. Patterned elision in cipher translations is taught early and pays off at closure without obscurity. No dialogue, so policy skips; meets 9+ with rhythmic control under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose density advances atmosphere via vivid images like "chill of drowned secrets," with varied rhythm and no major loops; figurative language integrates without muddle, as in the spider's web charging the die. Minor scaffold in repeated "she" stems during dance slightly dulls propulsion, but closure image remains sharp. High density and clarity support strong score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of code-breaking via dance in a flooded lab transforms tropes with specific details like ivorite dice from fingerbones, heightening stakes through tidal shame. Risk in lyric structure elevates without gimmickry, feeling inevitable at "I FORGIVE." Meets 9+ with non-obvious angle on encryption as defiance.</comment>
