<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages from capsule discovery to broadcast; closure as decisive change with resonant reconfiguration in mainland lights, cost felt in risk of confrontation; orientation anchors early in lighthouse setting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse and sea elements constrain choices, like wind carrying the capsule, and charge final balcony image with echoing waves; sensory details filtered through Lin's bias enhance atmosphere without excess.</comment>
