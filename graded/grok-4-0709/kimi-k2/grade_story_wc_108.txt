<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation as a phobia-ridden stunt double is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like decrypting the cast despite fear, revealing internal contradictions embodied in trembling hands and borrowed heartbeats. Interiority is concrete, with emotions like "heart hammering against ribs" showing embodied contradiction without therapy-speak. The twin's late appearance limits relationship crucible, but the protagonist's flaws drive mistakes that compound toward earned stasis in accepting vulnerability as power. The final confrontation earns the renunciation of falling for the twin, with visible cost in rewriting their shared life.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Causal, with because/therefore linkages like the seashell leading to the cast, film, and roof confrontation holding through closure. Structure is one continuous scene in the library with a motivated ascent to the roof, anchored early in who (stunt double), where (rusted library), and when (night after revelation). Closure is a Decisive Change in burning contracts and reuniting, with felt cost of lost identity but gained truth legible in the final image of flying on truth. Minor ellipsis in discoveries feels motivated but slightly convenient, preventing higher band entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars is vividly anchored with sensory details like salt smell and moonlight dripping, filtered through the POV's fear-biased perception. Setting constrains choices, as the corroded shelves and tin roof supply resources like the screwdriver and guide the climb, charging the final roof scene with ocean wind mirroring memory. Atmosphere supports the transformative betrayal theme through breathing girders and creaking approval, with spatial choreography coherent in aisles to booth to staircase. A recurring object like the seashell evolves to charge the closure, elevating specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving vulnerability as power escalates causally through discoveries narrowing options, with one meaningful tightening in climbing despite phobia, forcing stance crystallization on the roof. Pressure coheres under Causal lens, with agency in decrypting and confronting, but coincidence in finding items complicates without fully resolving. Cost is felt in trembling certainty and foreclosed past life, legible at closure, though internal conflict could interweave more deeply with external finds. The moral calculus between courage and fame sharpens the peak choice but lacks a second reversal for higher escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability as power emerges organically from events like decrypting the cast and burning contracts, with subtext in images like the leaning shelves mirroring exhausted lives. The final image of standing side by side offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing, inviting reflection on identity through ambiguity in the borrowed heartbeat. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars like the smiling twin, avoiding sentimentality with complex betrayal. Dramatic irony in the film's revelation reweights the premise with conceptual cost, though some metaphors feel slightly overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature in fear-tinged noticing like slick palms and starlight indentations, modulating rhythm under pressure without head-hopping. Voice texture is distinct in poetic syntax and rhythm, like "moonlight dripping through holes," consistent and purposeful in lyric compression. Dialogue is sparse but natural, with subtext in "I’m done falling for you" advancing the confrontation; elision in discoveries is taught early and paid off at closure. Minor register drift in elevated diction fits the introspective tone without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences like "The rusted library under stars smelled of salt and old iron" advancing atmosphere and stakes without loops. Rhythm varies naturally, with syntactic variety supporting propulsion, though some metaphors like "molten silver" border on overwriting without muddle. Clarity is strong, with clean grammar and no artifacts in closure, but occasional paraphrase loops in reflective blocks slightly drag momentum. Information advances through action, with final line recharging motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise of a stunt double discovering a twin via whispering seashell offers a fresh synthesis of identity and Hollywood betrayal, transformed through specific details like the child's cast and roof jump. Risk-taking in poetic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, with turns like the film revelation arising from character choices. Emotional complexity in vulnerability avoids generics, cohering as a singular vision. Minor echoes of twin tropes are personalized, but ingenuity could push bolder in subverting fame dynamics.</comment>
