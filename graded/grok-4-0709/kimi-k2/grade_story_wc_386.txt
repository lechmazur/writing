<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Nadia's motivation to salvage purity from mental wreckage is clear and intensifies through ritual actions, rooted in traits like her ghost-whispering expertise; interiority is concrete via embodied sensations like salt-stiff hair and gloved palms, with contradictory impulses in her wish for endless snow versus oceanic reclamation. Emotions are embodied without therapy-speak, as in the heartbeat thawing sorrow. The meaningful endurance forecloses paths with felt cost, evident in the locket sealing. Strength lies in micro-choices under pressure, like breathing salt onto her palm, revealing values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through layered imagery and ritual beats, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Nadia salvages snow into a locket, reweighting the wreckage with conceptual cost of thawed sorrow. Orientation anchors early with the glacier shrine and Nadia's kneeling. Closure lands on-page with felt cost via the locket pressing to her chest and strangers' dreams, holding the lens without contradiction. A persistent constraint like the melted globe shapes tactics, elevating the score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The candle-lit glacier shrine is vividly anchored with sensory details like frozen breath and blue glow, filtered through Nadia's POV bias; it constrains choices by providing the ice altar and walls for flame paths, charging the final image of the empty globe reflecting a star. Micro-setting of the globe itself evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Sensory selection reflects urgency, with frost and meltwater affecting actions. Environment pressures the ritual, making it indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of salvaging purity from wreckage signals early and deepens through ritual intensification, narrowing options as the globe sweats and relics bloom, under Accumulative/Textural lens. One meaningful cadence shift in the globe's clearing porthole forces stance crystallization with visible cost in the salvaged snow's leap. Agency via Nadia's breath and speech drives escalation, with cost unmistakable in the locket's thawing sorrow. Coincidence in dream cameos complicates but does not resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of shared dream connections and salvaging purity emerges organically from images like the melted globe and strangers' dreams, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the drowned's willing gift. Subtext in gestures like breathing frost and knotting threads invites reflection on loss without confusion. The final image of endless falling snow offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of wreckage, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with distinct perceptual signature in poetic noticing of sigils and glitter slurry; rhythmic control heightens pressure via patterned elision in dream sequences, taught early and paid off at closure. Prose texture modulates with intensity, using non-standard punctuation consistently for lyric effect without obscuring legibility. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets. Elision in memory slides is purposeful and changes tactics with cost.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, as in the opening's flowing syntax tracing sigils; clarity holds despite figurative density, with no loops or scaffold obscuring closure, like the clean final image of borrowed starlight. Information density is high, lines multitasking atmosphere and advancement without overwriting muddle in peak beats. Minor template cadence in ritual descriptions avoids penalty as it's pattern-taught and pays off. Opening and closing lines anchor voice effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise of dream-cameo ghost whispering in a glacier shrine offers fresh synthesis of wreck-diving and liminal ritual, feeling inevitable through evolving globe imagery; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Tropes like drowned ghosts are transformed via specific details like Morse echoes and anemone-coiled ring. Authenticity coheres in singular vision, with non-obvious moral calculus in salvaging purity. Bold compression elevates, as unconventional choices charge the resonant ending.</comment>
