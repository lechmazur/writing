<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to articulate unspoken needs intensifies compellingly, rooted in her traits as a seldom-heard balladeer, with embodied emotions like throat tightening revealing internal conflict. The ghost as her silenced self creates contradictory impulses, shown in her painting and singing under pressure. Flaw: secondary character (ghost) applies pressure but lacks full status dynamics in dialogue. Pivotal moment: realization of the ghost's identity earns the final singing with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images (ghost, bolt plate, graffiti) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the singing, with conceptual cost of dissolving silence into music. Orientation anchors early in the misty courtyard. Closure lands on-page with the ghost becoming harmony, reweighting the stake. Weakness: some elisions in the memory garden transition feel slightly unmotivated, but pattern holds without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above clouds constrains choices, with mist beading on graffiti and marble floating like a raft charging the ethereal atmosphere. Sensory details like scent of rain on copper and mist curling like cats are vivid and POV-filtered, mirroring Lira's internal needs. Recurring bolt plate as micro-setting charges the final image. Strength: environment evolves causally, pressuring the encoding and singing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of articulating unspoken needs tightens through graffiti encoding and ghost interaction, with a meaningful cadence shift in the singing under Accumulative/Textural lens. Pressure coheres via storm urgency, forcing stance crystallization. Cost is felt in the emotional release and courtyard fading. Pivotal moment: ghost stepping through the door narrows options, earning the resolution without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of transforming silence into articulated wonder emerges organically from images like pressed flowers and graffiti, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the ghost's dissolution. Subtext in gestures like the child's reach and scent release invites reflection. Final image of singing across the sky offers resonant, non-literal answer to unspoken needs. Strength: emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete confessions in the garden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable, with perceptual signature in Lira's biased noticing of lute strings and mist, modulating rhythm under pressure like faster painting. Prose texture is distinct, with purposeful compression in lyric mode taught early and paid off at closure. Dialogue is minimal but subtextual, like the ghost's whispered "Sing now." Strength: no head-hopping, and elisions change tactics without withholding known facts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like "Lightning flashed, freezing the scene in white" to propel momentum. No significant loops or artifacts; metaphors like mist curling like cats are coherent and purposeful. Clarity in grammar and sequence supports the accumulative build. Weakness: occasional elevated diction slightly drifts in peak beats, but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of balladeer encoding ghosts via graffiti and flower press transforms fantasy tropes into a non-obvious exploration of silenced needs. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Originality in the ghost as unmet need feels inevitable, with specificity like tinkersong wonder avoiding generics. Strength: core premise commits fully, reweighting silence into art at closure.</comment>
