<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ghost's motivation to preserve her fractured existence is clear and intensifies through embodied actions like exhaling on the coin, revealing contradictory impulses in her dual memories of death and tomorrow; interiority is concrete with synesthetic details like cinnamon-thunder chords, but emotions occasionally lean toward abstract performance rather than raw contradiction, slightly softening the final dissolution's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and echoes toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the ghost's dissolution, with conceptual cost legible in the minor chord's lingering loss; orientation anchors early in the orchard maze, but some elisions in timeline fracturing feel more poetic than taught, mildly diffusing causality without breaking closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mystic orchard garden constrains choices by sealing at dawn, with tactile details like upward-falling blossoms and dew-as-stage-light charging the final image of the gate and marquee; sensory specificity reflects the ghost's synesthetic bias, mirroring her internal nostalgia without overt symbolism, and the tree's cleft supplies pivotal objects that evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake of knitting the unraveling timeline escalates through a meaningful deepening in the dance that swells echoes into ovations, forcing stance crystallization under the Accumulative lens with felt cost in her form loosening; agency drives the coin's use and dance, but coincidence in the hoop's scattering mildly complicates without resolving, keeping pressure coherent yet not maximally narrowed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of fragile possibility amid loss emerges through images like the spinning wheel and intertwining vines, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the hush before the overture that reweights her existence; subtext in silences and projections invites reflection on time's dissonance without confusion, avoiding tidy morals, though nostalgia occasionally borders on sentimentality in popcorn-rosin scents.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual signature in synesthetic filters like indigo blooming with cinnamon-thunder, and rhythmic prose modulates with emotional intensity in pirouettes; no dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; purposeful compression in timeline elisions is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping, though some diction elevates poetically beyond strict ghost-bound lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose density is high with sentences like "petals of moonlit apple drifting through her translucent ribs like pale fireflies" advancing atmosphere and character simultaneously, free of loops or scaffold; rhythmic variety accelerates in the dance beat without muddle, and metaphors cohere logically, charging the final bow with propulsion; no artifacts obscure closure, though occasional overwriting in synesthetic stacks tests but doesn't break clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes ghost lore with synesthetic timeline repair in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming tropes through specific details like the tarot coin's wheel spinning into a hoop that scatters years; risk-taking in lyric accumulations heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in the hush's reconfiguration, with authenticity in the singular vision of rising nostalgia.</comment>
