<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The chemist's motivation is deeply rooted in grief and scientific traits, with embodied emotions like wind loosening grief clinging to her ribs; contradictory impulses between molecules and butterflies drive micro-choices, culminating in an earned renunciation of guilt through the chrysalis ritual. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, with flaws like betrayal in formulas complicating her resolve. The final polymer of resolve sets with visible cost, foreclosing erasure for incorporation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elisions of river braids and polymer metaphors, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where atonement incorporates loss, with conceptual cost legible in the fused chrysalis as a lens for connection. Orientation anchors early at the ravine lip; causality holds via textural density increases, like foam glyphs sparking insight. One meaningful deepening suffices, though reflection borders BRR limits without fully tilting present stance in the lab flashback.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The braided ravine is vividly specific, with sensory details like water voices and foam glyphs filtered through the chemist's bias, constraining choices like following channels and mirroring internal fault lines. Environment charges the final image, with quartz vein as suture evolving causally. Tone tensions grief with symphonic harmony, supporting theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, internal grief stake signals early and deepens via foam insight, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in loosened grief as navigable river; one cadence shift reweights separation into connection. Agency in ritual pours and pressing forecloses guilt, though coincidence of surge complicates without resolving. Moral calculus between science and love sharpens peak, but secondary pressures remain abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transforming loss into polymeric connection emerges organically from river patterns and chrysalis ritual, with resonant ambiguity in the amber lens reflecting endless rewriting without tidy morals. Subtext in foam wings and quartz mobile invites reflection on separation's temporality. Final image offers non-literal answer, repricing atonement as incorporation with emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Consistent third-person close POV with distinct perceptual signature in scientific metaphors like carbon chains; rhythmic control heightens pressure in symphonic water voices without obscurity. Lyric compression teaches patterns early, paying off in closure; no dialogue, but prose texture reflects focalizer's mind under stress. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and rhythm in phrases like "wind loosening the grief that had clung to her ribs"; zero loops or scaffolds, high information density in multifaceted lines like foam scribbling glyphs. Figurative language coheres without muddle, even in peak insight; opening anchors voice, final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of polymer chemistry with grief atonement feels inevitable, transforming tropes like divergent paths into fresh filament-stitching metaphor; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generics, with non-obvious angle on loss via carbon ashes. Commits fully to premise without retreat.</comment>
