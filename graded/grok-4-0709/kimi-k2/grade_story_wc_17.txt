<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as a cartographer rooted in family legacy is clear and drives her actions, but interiority relies on abstract labels like "sensitively perceptive" without embodied contradictions under pressure; emotions feel summarized rather than layered with irrationality, as in the overwhelming vision where she staggers but quickly resolves without visible cost. The final renunciation of hiding dreams shows endurance with some cost, yet flaws like stock phrasing limit depth. No second character, so relationship bullets ignored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned revelations like diary fragments and echoes, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Mara accepts the duty of remembering with conceptual cost in the final echo and note; orientation anchors early in the passage, but repetitive phrasing creates minor redundancy without breaking causality. The ending reweights legacy with undeniable pressure, though one meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage is vividly sensory and purposeful, with details like pulsing mortar and fossilized starlight constraining Mara's choices and charging the final chamber image; atmosphere mirrors internal discovery through ivy as "green nerves," evolving causally without static repetition. Micro-setting of the hearth and bricks integrates into action, reflecting POV bias effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering legacy's burden tightens through discoveries like the diary page and film strip, with one meaningful deepening in the chamber vision that narrows options and forces stance crystallization under Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is felt in the overwhelming senses and accepted duty, but pressure remains somewhat abstract without a sharper trade-off. Coincidence in finding fragments complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of legacy as remembering dreams emerges organically from images like sighing bricks and recalled starlight, culminating in a resonant final note that reweights the concept without moralizing; subtext in whispers and echoes invites reflection on loss, but some direct statements like "legacy's burden is to keep the dream alive" border on thematic echo, slightly reducing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature in echo-mapping, but patterned elision of repetitive phrases like "half-burned diaries" feels untaught and obscures clarity rather than paying off; prose texture is lyrical yet drifts into elevated diction mismatched to stress, as in the chamber chord rattling ribs. No dialogue, so those bullets ignored.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Prose suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence, like repeated "half-burned diaries found in the fireplace" across sentences without advancement, dulling momentum in discovery beats; figurative language stacks densely in peak moments, such as "bricks mourning constellations now veiled by carbon haze," creating muddle without payoff. Information density is low due to redundancy, though some sentences multitask atmosphere and action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The premise of echo-cartographing dreaming walls in a post-climate shift world offers a fresh synthesis of sci-fi and lyric elements, transforming tropes of legacy through specific sensory details like negative light; however, repetitive phrasing echoes prompt-like construction, reducing ingenuity, though the final hum as a lullaby risks boldness that heightens thematic stakes.</comment>
