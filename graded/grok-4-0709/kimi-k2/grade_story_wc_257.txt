<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mourning jewelry maker's motivation evolves credibly from despair to renewal through embodied actions like folding cranes and threading beads, revealing contradictory impulses in her desire to forget yet remember; interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, with the final renunciation of mourning jewelry for seeds showing earned endurance with felt cost. The caretaker's secondary pressure is apt but minimal, fitting the single-POV scope. The child's brief appearance heightens emotional contradiction without overwhelming the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of cranes, coordinates, and gardens, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where grief is repriced as cultivation with conceptual cost legible in the final crane release; orientation anchors early with the arrival at the observatory. Closure lands on-page with undeniable pressure via the locket's burial and the dome staying open, reweighting prior motifs without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The timeless observatory is vividly specific, with the dome as a dilated pupil and curtains embroidered with star charts constraining choices and charging the final image where vines climb the telescope; atmosphere mirrors grief through sensory details like damp earth scent, evolving causally as the garden overlaps the marble floor. Micro-setting of instruments and cranes integrates into action, reflecting POV bias toward memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming grief tightens accumulatively through crane-folding and projections, deepening to a stance crystallization when the maker kneels in the overlapping garden, foreclosing forgetting with felt cost in the uncoiling hair; pressure coheres under the textural lens with one meaningful cadence shift at the caretaker's illumination. Agency via renunciation is earned, though coincidence in the caretaker's actions complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of mourning as cultivation emerges organically from images like jet beads as mulch and blooming darkness, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in subdued ardor; subtext in gestures like pressing the stencil and unfolding cranes invites reflection on grief's lens. The final image of the released crane offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of memory without stated epiphany.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and biased toward the maker's perceptual signature of astronomical and botanical metaphors, with rhythmic control in dense, patterned prose that heightens emotional intensity; dialogue is sparse, natural, and subtextual, like the caretaker's single line advancing the thematic lesson. Patterned elision in lyric mode is taught early and pays off at closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, each sentence advancing atmosphere and theme through vivid images like "ink bled into starlight"; rhythm varies naturally, free of loops or artifacts, with strong verbs and specific diction propelling toward the resonant ending. No overwriting or muddled metaphors, even in peak beats like the garden overlap.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mourning jewelry, origami cranes with coordinates, and an astrolabe AI transforms grief tropes into a fresh premise of celestial gardening; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the final reconfiguration. Emotional specificity avoids generics, with the caretaker's winding down offering a non-obvious inflection.</comment>
