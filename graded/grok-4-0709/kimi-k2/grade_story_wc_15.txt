<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to mend ruin through sleepwalking paths is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in her weaver traits and embodied in contradictory grief-hope impulses during the spiral discovery. Interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions like the plate's warmth revealing character under pressure. The final renunciation of the labyrinth forecloses her old path with felt cost, earning the transformation in her stride.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through nightly paths and motifs, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing closure where the stone boat reweights ruin to reverence with conceptual cost in the sealed labyrinth. Orientation anchors who (Lira), where (canyon), and when (after tide pools empty) by the first sentence. The spiral center payoff reconfigures options via persistent sleepwalking constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The red canyon setting is vivid and purposeful, with sandstone walls and tide pools constraining Lira's paths and charging the final trickle of water as resonant closure. Sensory details like bruised velvet moonlight and orchid perfume reflect POV bias and evolve causally, mirroring her internal shift. The labyrinth as loom directly guides choices, fulfilling the 9+ test by constraining the spiral discovery and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mending ruin tightens accumulatively through nights, with agency in Lira's chanting and walking driving a meaningful deepening that narrows options at the spiral. Cost is legible in the grief knot and sealed canyon, reweighting the stake under the textural lens. The fourteenth night's seamless walk forces stance crystallization with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reweaving broken precedents emerges organically from Lira's paths and motifs like the phoenix carvings, culminating in a resonant final image of the refilling tide pool without stated moral. Subtext in gestures like placing the plate invites reflection on memory and ruin. The ending offers a non-literal answer to carving paths from ruin, reweighting prior unraveling with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature in poetic noticing like orchid solace and bruised velvet, modulating rhythm under pressure without elision issues. Prose texture is distinct in syntax and rhythm, reflecting Lira's weaver mind. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; focalization stays character-bound with purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, each sentence advancing atmosphere and theme through vivid images like the nautilus spiral, free of loops or artifacts. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the fourteenth night without overwriting; final line resolves by recharging the orchid motif. Zero scaffold, strong verbs, and purposeful syntax fulfill the 9+ test impeccably.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes weaving, labyrinths, and sleepwalking into a fresh angle on redemption, feeling inevitable with risk-taking in lyric structure that heightens stakes without gimmickry. Tropes like phoenix are transformed through specific choices like downward sprouting, committing fully to the vision. The stone boat as closure object offers non-obvious ingenuity, elevating via bold poetic commitment.</comment>
