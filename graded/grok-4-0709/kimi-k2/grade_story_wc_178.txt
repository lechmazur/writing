Emotions are embodied in his patched coat and charcoal diagrams, revealing a hierarchy of values where order trumps personal glory. The final renunciation of star-charts feels earned with a visible cost, foreclosing his path of naming comets.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through patterned permutations of the tile and nights of work, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the covenant seals with the conceptual cost of surrendered star-charts. Orientation anchors early in the palace's hush between regimes. The pattern break on the seventh dusk provides a meaningful deepening that reweights the stake without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The reimagined Babylonian palace is vividly specific, with shifting corridors and lapis mosaics constraining choices and guiding the protagonist to the chamber. Sensory details like dusky harmony and ember-soft sconces reflect POV bias and urgency, mirroring his internal quest. The setting charges the final image of the palace singing a lullaby, making it indispensable to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake of heavenly certainty escalates through accumulative pressure of nightly realignments, tightening to a single deepening on the seventh dusk that narrows options to the covenant. Agency shines in the protagonist's hesitation and signature, with the felt cost of forfeited star-charts legible on the page. Coincidence in the tile's freezing complicates but does not resolve, fitting the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of devotion as sacrifice emerges organically from the tile's permutations and the covenant's equation, resisting tidy morals through the ambiguity of unknown powers.

The final image of the steady Crooked Staff provides a non-literal repricing of certainty's cost without assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature biased toward astronomical measurements and frugal details like waxed thread.
