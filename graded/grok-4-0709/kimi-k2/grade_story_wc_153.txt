<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, patterns of spirits' singing and letter-reading build density to a Resonant Reconfiguration at the mirror, with felt cost in dissolved bitterness; orientation anchors early in the skiff and mangrove, and closure lands on-page with undeniable pressure via the boy's smiling face.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of confronting unsent regrets tightens through letter-reading deepenings under textural lens, forcing stance crystallization with legible cost in the scarless healing; agency in slicing her palm drives escalation, narrowing options to an earned absolution.</comment>
