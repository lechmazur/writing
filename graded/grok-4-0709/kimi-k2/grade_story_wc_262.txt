<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to find unused love is clear and intensifies through embodied emotions, with contradictory impulses shown in her handling the film and singing the tune; the final renunciation of stillness is earned by prior psychometry, foreclosing inaction with the felt cost of carried heartbreak, as in her voice cracking the equilibrium.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and motifs like film and lyrics, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where unused love is reweighted as patient and stored in intervals, with undeniable conceptual cost in Mara's resonant understanding; orientation anchors early in the booth, and the closure lands on-page with the tune carried in her chest.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The projection booth is vividly specific with smells of hot carbon and velvet rot, constraining choices like using the rewinder for the quartz; it charges the final image as incubating silence, with micro-setting details like the window framing the screen mirroring internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming unused love tightens through psychometry deepening, narrowing options to confront the letter's latency; under Accumulative lens, cadence shifts reweight the stake with felt cost in the melody's resonance, though coincidence of finding the film slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of unused love's persistence emerges organically from images like latent frames and forgotten lyrics, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in silences and implications, like the letter folding into Lin's silhouette, invites reflection on unspent tenderness with emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Mara's spatially imaginative filters, like theater as anatomy; prose texture is purposeful with rhythmic metaphors, and patterned elision in memories pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like "hushed thunder of reels," advancing atmosphere without loops; some figurative density in peak beats risks muddle but is pattern-taught and pays off, with high information density and no artifacts obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry and film as love's storage transforms tropes through specific details like the quartz on the rewinder, heightening stakes with bold lyric risk that feels inevitable, as in the letter detaching like a moth.</comment>
