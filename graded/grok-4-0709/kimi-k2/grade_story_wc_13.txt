<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to complete the bestiary drives consistent, high-stakes choices, rooted in her traits as an illustrator, with embodied anticipation in her trembling pencil; interiority shows contradictory impulses, like whispering an apology while stealing time, earning the final renunciation of the city's stability with felt cost in the mirrors' visions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elisions and symbolic escalations like the expanding pendant, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the bird's capture and the mirrors' reconfiguration of time, with conceptual cost legible in the empty city vision; orientation anchors early in the tower scene, and causality holds without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rooftop canal system vividly constrains choices, with moonlit water and glass troughs pressuring Lira's navigation and time-sculpting, charging the final image as it collapses back to ordinary; sensory details like trickling water and ascending droplets are purposeful, mirroring her internal anticipation and the giant's dream logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of capturing the echo birthplace tightens through the pendant's expansion and cage interaction, deepening via the borrowed time with felt cost in subtracted seconds; under Accumulative/Textural lens, cadence shift in the bird's song reweights options, though coincidence in the rumor slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of preserving ephemeral dreams amid inevitable change emerges through images like the infinity pendant and glass bird, offering resonant ambiguity in the mirrors' futures without moralizing; subtext in the interrupted cadence and uncaging invites reflection on creation's costs, with the final portable echo repricing the premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and biased through Lira's perceptual signature, with rhythmic prose modulating like "climbed, climbed, then cut itself short" under pressure; purposeful compression in time-bending teaches its pattern, paying off at closure without head-hopping or elision obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose density is high with multi-job sentences like the canal forking into harp strings, advancing atmosphere and stakes; rhythm varies naturally, though minor synonym loops in dream descriptions slightly dull momentum without touching closure; no major artifacts obscure the peak cage scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of urban fantasy with musical architecture and time-sculpting feels inevitable, transforming tropes like magical pendants through specific risks like stealing from the giant, heightening stakes in the mirrors' prophetic cost without gimmickry.</comment>
