<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's cool-headedness is concretely embodied through her deliberate steps and humming silence, creating contradictory impulses as she strategizes yet surrenders her core trait at closure; the final renunciation feels earned with visible cost, like her racing pulse, though interiority occasionally veers into abstract labels like "small grief."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and cadence shifts, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira gains the echo at the cost of her coolness; orientation anchors early with Lira at the garden's edge; closure lands on-page with felt cost, though some elisions feel more poetic than pressured.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vividly specific, with reeds in sine waves and air transliterating emotions, constraining Lira's zigzag path and charging the final image as sound waves rearrange; this micro-setting evolves causally, mirroring her internal shift without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of catching the goddess's echo tightens through the spike's use and her emotional surrender, with one meaningful deepening as constellations pause and she inhales the chord; cost is legible in losing cool-headedness, driving agency under the textural lens, though pressure feels more atmospheric than narrowing options sharply.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of breaking patterns and bearing witness emerges organically through recurring images like zigzagging and feral lullabies, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights mortality and divinity without moralizing; subtext in silence and echoes invites reflection on surrender, though some metaphors border on overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and biased through Lira's perceptual signature, with poetic diction like "voicing silence the way a wolf mouths snow" teaching patterned elision that pays off at closure; rhythmic control heightens under pressure without head-hopping, though dense syntax occasionally tests legibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, multi-job sentences like the spike's impact ringing as a "low C that bent upward into a question mark," varying rhythm purposefully; minor scaffold in repetitive "transliterated" phrasing deducts slightly, but no loops obscure closure, and figurative language coheres without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fishing, sound gardens, and sleepwalking stars feels inevitable through specific inflections like the iron spike as antenna for divinity; risk-taking in lyric density heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes like goddess echoes into a fresh angle on surrender and patterns.</comment>
