<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her past loss, compelling her to repair the drone with high stakes; interiority is concrete through sensory embodiment like feeling warmth on her cheeks and whispering to the drone as to her daughter. Emotions are embodied and contradictory, shown in her steady calm amid urgency, avoiding stock phrasing. The final endurance forecloses no path but accepts cost via the lullaby hum, charging the stasis. Single-POV focus excels without needing relationship bullets.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure links actions tightly—e.g., the anchor's clank motivates hurried patching, leading to the drone's flight and star map decoding—with orientation anchored early in the depot workshop. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise in the final image of humming and waiting, with felt cost in the daughter's lullaby evoking past loss. One meaningful tightening suffices, and causality holds without breaks. Orientation is clear by paragraph one, waiving any penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mist-coated rail depot anchors vividly early, with sensory details like fog echoes and tin drips filtered through Mara's blind POV, constraining choices via sound and warmth. The water basin as micro-setting charges the repair beat and final image, evolving causally to mirror her calm. Details integrate into action, mirroring internal states subtly without overt symbolism. Environment pressures the timeframe, heightening urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of repairing the drone before the Orion departs signals early and tightens once via the loudspeaker crackle, narrowing options and forcing faster patching with legible cost in her flown fingers. Under Causal lens, pressure coheres through because/therefore links, culminating in agency-driven release; one deepening suffices. Cost is felt in the emotional reprise of the lullaby, charging the poise. No coincidences resolve; stakes remain visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of patient repair as promise-keeping emerges organically from Mara's actions and the depot's calm, with subtext in whispers and ripples inviting reflection on loss without tidy morals. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by repricing departures as returns, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost in her enduring wait. No direct statements; ambiguity lingers meaningfully via the daughter's lullaby. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete sensory closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in sound/warmth bias fitting Mara's blindness, and rhythmic prose modulates with urgency—short sentences during patching accelerate tension. No dialogue, so those bullets ignored; free indirect style is clean, with purposeful compression in lyric descriptions taught early. Elision of full backstory tilts present stance via the daughter whisper, paying off at end. Distinct texture in syntax evokes calm amid pressure without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally—e.g., long descriptive openings breathe into short, propulsive action like "fingers flew now." No loops or artifacts; metaphors like "thinner than rumor" are controlled and coherent, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Clarity holds with strong verbs and specific details; final line recharges motifs effectively. Minor overwriting in mist descriptions doesn't obscure closure, but trims potential.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blindness with refractive repair method transforms artisan trope through specific sensory ingenuity, feeling inevitable in hindsight via the water basin. Risk in lyric calm heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise implications. No close echoes; originality in subverting sight via touch/sound enriches theme organically. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on loss and redemption.</comment>
