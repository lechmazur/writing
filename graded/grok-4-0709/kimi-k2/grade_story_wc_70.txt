<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marisol's involuntary truthfulness consistently motivates her interactions, revealing character through micro-choices like her honest responses to travelers; interiority is concrete, with embodied hope amid uncertainty, but contradictory impulses are mild and not simultaneous in key scenes, slightly limiting depth; the final renunciation of doubt earns stasis with felt cost in the transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with image density building to a Conceptual Repricing closure where failure transforms into a cocoon phase with conceptual cost in reweighted wonder; orientation anchors early at the tower base in nectar dusk; one meaningful deepening via the riddle solution tightens the pattern effectively, though causality feels more textural than strictly motivated in the bee emergence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful details like nectar dusk smelling of burnt ozone and copper veins create atmosphere filtered through Marisol's bias; the tower setting constrains her climb and charges the final glowing image with bioluminescence, meeting the 9+ test; sensory selection reflects urgency, evolving causally from silent to humming.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving wonder tightens through the riddle's deepening, reweighting failure under the textural lens with legible conceptual cost in the blackout's pause; agency drives the match-striking intensification, but pressure feels more atmospheric than narrowing options sharply; one meaningful cadence shift suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wonder as transformative emerges organically from riddle, images, and events without direct statements, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final whisper that reweights the premise; subtext in gestures like striking the match invites reflection on failure's pause; avoids tidy morals, embracing complexity in the bees' luminous rebirth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Consistent third-person close POV with distinct perceptual signature in Marisol's wonder-biased noticing; prose texture poetic and rhythmic, modulating with emotional intensity; brief dialogue natural and subtextual, advancing her truthful nature; no head-hopping, with purposeful compression in lyric mode taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with vivid, propulsion-driven sentences; rhythm varies naturally, but minor paraphrase loops like repeated "nectar dusk" slightly dull momentum without obscuring closure; metaphors coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the match-striking; zero major artifacts, meeting 9+ test thresholds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lightning-harvesting tower, riddle-box, and wonder as answer feels inevitable, transforming failure tropes through specific surreal details; risk in poetic structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry; non-obvious angle on preservation amid blackout elevates ingenuity.</comment>
