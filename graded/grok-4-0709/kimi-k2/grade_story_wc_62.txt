<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to shape collective grief is clear and intensifies through her interactions with the ribbon and spectral mentor, compelling her to carve and release sorrow; interiority is concrete and embodied, as in her throat tightening before reading the poem. Emotions are contradictory yet meditative, shown in her need for guidance while enduring alone, aligning actions with traits under pressure. The final renunciation of solitary grief earns stasis with felt cost in the village's tears, though secondary characters like father and brother apply limited pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned imagery of butterflies, ribbons, and poems, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where grief migrates like wings, with undeniable conceptual cost in reweighted sorrow; orientation anchors early in the greenhouse at dusk. Closure lands on-page with the stone's placement and new custom, reconfiguring options via the mentor's dissolution and Mara's whisper, foreclosing isolation. Persistent ribbon constraint shapes tactics, charging the final image of stars as chisel marks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse at dusk anchors vividly with wet loam, bruised citrus, and glass panes vibrating, constraining choices like Mara's dusk carvings and butterfly interactions; sensory details are selective, reflecting POV bias in meditative calm. Environment evolves causally with migrations and pollen snow, mirroring internal grief through tactile navigation. Recurring ribbon and stone as micro-settings charge the final image of collective release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of shaping collective grief signals early and deepens through accumulative pressure of readings and carvings, narrowing options via the mentor's guidance; one meaningful cadence shift in the vortex and map reconfiguration forces stance crystallization with felt cost in tears. Agency drives escalation as Mara retraces and chisels, earning reconfiguration without coincidence resolving. Moral calculus between holding and releasing sorrow sharpens the peak, though secondary stakes like family dinners accent without dominating.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of grief as migration emerges organically from butterfly motifs, ribbon maps, and poems, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the final poem's echo, reweighting sorrow without moralizing. Subtext in silences, wings spelling letters, and spectral touches invites reflection on love's echo. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through complex ambiguity in enduring customs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature in citrus scents and wing brushes biased toward meditative grief; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, image-rich prose modulating with intensity. Spectral dialogue carries subtext and advances plot, like "Begin" prompting the reading. Patterned elision in poetic phrasing is taught early and pays off at closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like pollen snow and thundering calm; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in readings and breathing in meditative pauses. Minor scaffold in repetitive unspooling phrases, but no loops obscure closure; metaphors are coherent and purposeful, enhancing propulsion. Final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravestone carving with butterfly migration and spectral poetry trading transforms grief tropes through specific, grounded choices like the ribbon map and wing grooves. Risk in accumulative structure heightens stakes via poetic ambiguity, feeling inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in collective release avoids generics, committing to premise with authentic vision.</comment>
