<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to prove gardens know their gardeners is clear and intensifies through her pragmatic use of marbles, revealing interior contradictions in her deceptive yet mending approach; emotions are embodied in scarred hands and polishing actions, with the final renunciation of the split marble earning stasis by foreclosing deception's full reveal. The queen's skepticism provides secondary pressure, shifting status dynamics as vines respond. Flaws like Lira's reliance on lies complicate choices without hedging, shown in the buried marble's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through layered memories and marble tales, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where the wisteria blooms and the queen reweights luck's measurability; closure lands with conceptual cost in the buried marble and shortened paths, reconfiguring human-garden intention. Orientation anchors early in the garden maze at dawn. Persistent marble constraint shapes tactics, charging the final image of the vine-woman.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The garden maze setting is vivid and purposeful, with dew-clung iron archways and blooming-withering scents filtering through Lira's gardener bias; it constrains choices like the left fork based on marble color and charges the closure as hedges shorten and wisteria blooms. Sensory details evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Recurring vines and marbles function as micro-setting, pressuring the queen's device crack.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving gardens' knowledge escalates texturally through marble stories, deepening to a cadence shift when the wisteria blooms and device cracks, narrowing options with the buried marble's cost; agency in Lira's renunciation forecloses full truth, with moral calculus between deception and growth. Coincidence of blossom falling complicates but doesn't resolve. One meaningful deepening suffices, though cost could be more viscerally felt beyond conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory mending deceptions emerges organically from marble motifs and garden responses, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in "nothing lasts, but everything remembers"; subtext in gestures like polishing and the split marble's burial offers resonant reconfiguration without statement. Final image of the vine-woman cradling a child reweights the premise non-literally. Emotional aftereffect lingers through sap-like tears, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV holds with Lira's perceptual signature in flawed-moon marbles and chlorophyll stains, modulating rhythm under pressure; dialogue carries subtext, like the queen's scoff versus device silence, distinguishing voices naturally. Prose texture is distinct in lyric compression, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in phrases like "blooming withering" without loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere, such as petals like purple snow, propelling momentum to closure. No artifacts obscure the blooming climax. Information advances atmosphere and character seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of measurable luck with memory-marbles transforms trope of magical gardens through Lira's pragmatic deceptions, feeling inevitable in the vine's woman-child shape; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry. Avoids stock metaphors, committing to premise's implications.</comment>
