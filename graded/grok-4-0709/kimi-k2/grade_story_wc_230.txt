<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira's motivation as a truffle forager with involuntary truthfulness is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in traits that drive her to plant the eye despite fear; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in her unintended confession under the almond bough. Kestrel as secondary character applies relevant pressure through his confessions, forcing her stance crystallization. The resolution earns her endurance as caretaker with felt cost of ongoing guardianship, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural dominant at closure), causal linkages build to a Resonant Reconfiguration where planting the eye reweights the orchard's stability with conceptual cost of fragile grace; orientation anchors early in the ravine setting without debt. One meaningful deepening occurs as the eye eases her compulsion, foreclosing unchecked truth with visible root anchoring. Minor ellipsis in storm arrival feels motivated but slightly softens hindsight inevitability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The hanging orchard in the ravine is vividly specific, with sensory details like metallic lightning scent and flood-scoured gullies filtering through Lira's forager bias; environment constrains choices, as storm-battered branches pressure the mapping task and charge the final image of swaying canopy. Micro-setting of soil and roots evolves causally, mirroring her internal hush. Recurring almond bough and loam details integrate into action without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving the orchard escalates through coherent pressure of impending landslide, tightening via her fear confession and branch crack, forcing agency in planting the eye under Accumulative/Textural lens; one meaningful deepening narrows options with visible cost of voluntary truths as lullabies. Coincidence of rain complicates but does not resolve. Moral calculus between honesty and stability sharpens the peak choice effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of fragile truth and psychological safety emerges organically from events like the eye's planting and root anchoring, resisting tidy morals through ambiguity in the orchard's contraband nature; subtext in gestures like Kestrel's widened eye invites reflection on self-deception. Final image of glowing eye offers resonant, non-literal repricing of honesty without stated moral. Emotional aftereffect lingers via fractured grace, tied to particulars without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature in Lira's skeptical, sensory noticing of soil and fungus; voice texture distinct in rhythmic, image-rich prose that modulates with pressure, like fractured laughter. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances plot, as in Kestrel's confession pursuing orchard survival. Purposeful compression in reflective blocks anchors in present cues without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid lines like "branches of grafted pear and almond dangled like nooses"; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops or scaffold, though minor figurative muddle in "rain soft as apology" slightly drifts register. No artifacts obscure closure; strong verbs and specific nouns propel momentum. Final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-plague truffle foraging with smuggled relic and truth-compelling virus transforms tropes through specific details like the eye's winking legend and mycorrhizal networks; risk in lyric, fractured tone heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise commits to implications, feeling inevitable in hindsight via the eye's planting. Avoids derivative echoes with authentic vision.</comment>
