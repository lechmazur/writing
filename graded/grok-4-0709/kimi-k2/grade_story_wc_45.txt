<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ivy's motivation as a forgiving skeptic is clear and intensifies compellingly, with interior contradictions embodied in her bending skepticism during the garden ritual; emotions are contradictory and rooted in flaws, shown through her methodical patience turning to possibility at the skeleton's transformation. The final renunciation of pure skepticism earns its cost via prior causality, foreclosing rigid certainty. Relationships pressure choices effectively with the girl's revelation, altering their dynamic by the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural, holding through closure as image density and pattern breaks (e.g., tooth pulsing, bones knitting into light) reweight the stake of certainty with conceptual cost. Closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing on-page, with the skeleton's dissolution into a constellation reconfiguring mistakes as guidance, carrying undeniable conceptual cost in guilt's transformation; orientation anchors early in the dawn discovery. One meaningful deepening suffices, but minor ellipsis in maze navigation slightly softens causality without breaking the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The secret garden and hedge maze anchor spatially and constrain choices, with overgrown roses and briars pressuring the ritual; sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, like the muffled footsteps and bruised rose scent, charging the final image of the dissolving skeleton. Environment evolves causally, mirroring internal possibility as vines uncoil. A recurring object (tooth) charges the closure, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconciling skepticism with magic tightens meaningfully under textural lens via the girl's revelation and ritual, narrowing options to embrace possibility with felt cost in certainty's cleft widening; agency drives the humming and tooth placement, crystallizing stance without coincidence resolving. One deepening suffices, but cost is more conceptual than visceral, slightly softening peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of turning mistakes into forgiveness emerges organically from images like the tooth and constellation, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer at the skeleton's transformation that reweights prior skepticism without moralizing; subtext in gestures and implications deepens complexity. The final image invites lingering ambiguity on borrowed lives, earning wisdom through specific struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Ivy's veterinary-biased noticing, like tweezers for foxes; voice texture is purposeful with rhythmic, lyric compression taught early and paid off in closure shimmer. Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot naturally, distinguishing characters via the girl's whispers and Ivy's certainty. No head-hopping or register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like the pulsing tooth and uncoiling vines advancing atmosphere; zero loops or scaffold, but occasional figurative density in peak beats (e.g., "cleft in certainty open like a fault line") borders on muddle without obscuring clarity. Information is high, with strong verbs and clean mechanics; final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of changeling lore with veterinary forgiveness feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like bone-setting magic; risk in nostalgic innovation heightens stakes via the constellation payoff without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on skepticism, committing fully with authentic vision.</comment>
