<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is deeply rooted in her insurgent past and contradictory impulses, shown through her hidden bullet and decision to unseal the embryo, earning a meaningful change with felt cost in challenging elders; interiority is concrete and embodied, avoiding stock phrasing, as in her pulse-matching moment with the child.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and elision to a resonant reconfiguration in the unsealing and new tradition proposal, with conceptual cost legible in the evolving destiny; orientation anchors early in the hot springs, and closure lands on-page with undeniable pressure via the mountain's approval.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The volcanic hot springs setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices like the heat stinging Lila's knees during prying, while charging the final image with bubbling approval; sensory details are selective, POV-filtered, and evolve causally, meeting the 9+ test by shaping the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of evolving tradition escalates through textural deepening, with agency in Lila's unsealing forcing stance crystallization and a visible cost in elder protests; one meaningful tightening suffices, driven by protagonist choice under the lens, though secondary pressures feel slightly diffuse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of destiny as living negotiation emerges organically from images like the amber womb and plant whispers, offering a resonant, non-literal answer in the final bell notes without moralizing; subtext in symbols and ambiguity invites reflection, meeting the 9+ test by reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice maintains distinct perceptual signature through plant gossip and reed whispers, with rhythmic control under pressure; purposeful elision in war backstory is taught and paid off, no head-hopping, and sparse dialogue carries subtext effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, propulsion-driven sentences like "steam rose... like ancestral breath," free of loops or artifacts; syntactic variety and strong verbs support momentum, passing the 9+ test with zero scaffold and clear clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of magical realism with post-war reconstruction transforms tropes through specific details like the carved bullet and kite script, feeling inevitable with risk-taking that heightens stakes in the unsealing; non-obvious angle on destiny avoids derivatives.</comment>
