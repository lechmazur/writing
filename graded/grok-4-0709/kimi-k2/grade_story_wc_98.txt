<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to protect cultural memory is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like planting the seed and summoning witnesses in the dream, revealing contradictory impulses in her luminous doubt that persists at closure. Interiority is concrete and embodied, as in tasting stories' flatness like watered wine, avoiding stock phrasing. The single-POV focus excels without needing secondary characters, earning high marks for flawed endurance with felt cost in ongoing questioning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, patterned imagery of petals, dreams, and rain builds to a resonant reconfiguration where the seed sprouts, anchoring memories with conceptual cost of persistent doubt. Orientation anchors early in the ridge setting before monsoon, with no disorientation debt. Closure lands on-page with the sapling's emergence and ridge straightening, reweighting the stake through cadence shift; the dream's communal pulse shapes tactics effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ancient ridge in bloom is vividly specific, with moss humming like a sleeping lute and petals carrying syllables, constraining Mira's choices by humming narratives she tastes. Sensory details like pollen on lips and raindrop on cheek are purposeful, mirroring internal forgetting through evolving environment. The ridge cradles her and shivers in recognition, charging the final image where it straightens with reclaimed belief.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of anchoring memories before monsoon tightens through accelerating forgetting and dream pressures, with one meaningful deepening in summoning witnesses to green the leaves. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, cadence shifts reweight cost via the fruit's knowledge flood and ongoing doubt. Agency drives escalation through Mira's interpreted dreams, with visible price in doubting loved luminosities, though coincidence of rain entering the dream slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of protecting collective memory through doubt emerges organically from images like molting dragon scales and curling library leaves, inviting reflection on truth's fragility without tidy morals. Subtext in pollen-exhaled dreams and petal syllables builds resonance, culminating in a non-literal final image of rooted memories needing questioning. Emotional aftereffect lingers via Mira's flickering doubt, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and biased through Mira's perceptual signature, like tasting tales' pH, with rhythmic prose modulating via scented sleep and pulsing seed. Patterned elision in dream sequences is taught early and pays off at closure without confusion. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; syntax reflects her whimsical interiority under pressure, as in whispering to the orchid.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with vivid metaphors like raindrops the size of lullabies advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold; sentence variety breathes naturally, as in the orchid's exhale folding into a dream. No artifacts obscure closure, and information density shines in multi-job lines like the seed pulsing like a second heart. Final line resolves with resonant image of ossified memories, cut off mid-word for charged effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy reality-checking with empirical whimsy transforms tropes through specific details like tasting stories' specific gravity, feeling inevitable in the dream-library reprise. Risk-taking in lyric dream structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise of memory as blooming ridge. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on cultural forgetting, though some imagery echoes familiar mythic motifs without full subversion.</comment>
