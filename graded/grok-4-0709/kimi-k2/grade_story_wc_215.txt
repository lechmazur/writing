<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The recluse's motivation to preserve unspoken promises is clear and intensifies through concrete actions like reading the strips aloud, revealing interior contradictions in his flight from the city and commitment to silence; emotions are embodied in his handling of the box and perceptions of ghosts, with flaws like isolation driving inevitable solitude at closure. Ghosts as secondary characters apply subtle pressure, their regrets mirroring his own without overwhelming the single-POV focus. A minor slip in stock phrasing for regret (e.g., "amber and sticky with regret") slightly flattens embodiment, but the hierarchy of values shines in his final renunciation of leaving.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered realizations in one continuous scene, with orientation anchored by the first sentence in who (recluse), where (abandoned beekeeping oasis), and when (after ghosts became visible). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing where the recluse's own strip reweights the covenant as a confession, with felt cost in the box's heaviness and his enduring isolation. One meaningful deepening suffices, as the spiral hive pattern and wax runes accumulate to the resonant final image of blooming ghost bees.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The scorched wasteland and abandoned apiary are vividly specific, with sensory details like wind hissing through skeps and charred posts mirroring the recluse's internal silence; the setting constrains choices, as the ruin's spiral and amber rivulets directly enable his translation of the covenant, charging the final image of refracting light. Micro-details like propolis tears evolve causally, integrating into action without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of deciphering the covenant's true intent escalates through textural density, with a meaningful deepening when tracing wax runes reveals it as a confession, narrowing options to reading aloud and foreclosing departure. Cost is legible in the box's growing weight and ghosts' fading, crystallizing his stance in Charged Poise; agency via renunciation heightens pressure without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken promises' weight emerges organically through images like absconded bees carrying pollen-words and the box preserving silences, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer where the covenant reprices as confession without moralizing. Subtext in ghosts' regrets and the recluse's own strip invites ambiguity about silence's cost, enriched by emotional honesty in propolis tears.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and character-bound, with perceptual signature in tranquilly perceptive noticing of contextual clues like hive spirals; prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax that modulates with intensity, as in the dusk cooling and stars piercing. No dialogue present, so ignored; purposeful compression in lyric mode teaches patterns early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and rhythm accelerating in realizations like tracing runes, free of loops or scaffold; figurative language coheres without muddle, as in "propolis tears that solidified into amber droplets," advancing atmosphere and theme. High information density integrates details into action, with the final line resolving by recharging the box motif; minor register elevation in phrases like "mute eloquence" fits voice without drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghosts, beekeeping ruins, and tangled covenants transforms familiar supernatural tropes through specific details like silver-soldered boxes and pollen-carried words, feeling inevitable in the recluse's reading aloud. Risk-taking in lyric, accumulative structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, committing to mute eloquence that avoids middle-ground hedging.</comment>
