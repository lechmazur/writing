<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila's motivation as a persistent leader is clear and intensifies through her actions and interior reflections, with embodied emotions like touching the bell to her lips revealing contradictory impulses of relic-like reverence amid exile's weariness. Internal conflict shows in her dialogue with Tomasz, where she endures doubt to affirm community, earning a meaningful stance crystallization with felt cost in the gathering. The single on-page relationship with Tomasz applies pressure, forcing her to articulate values, though secondary characters like Soraya are more illustrative than crucible-deep.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned bell rings and ridge walks, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the seeds and declaration reweight survival into planted hope with conceptual cost of ongoing sanctions. Orientation anchors early with the ridge and Lila's routine, avoiding disorientation penalties. Causality holds via textural density increase, though the crate's coincidental arrival slightly softens pressure without resolving it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ridge and terra-cotta arbor anchor vividly with sensory details like wet clay and woodsmoke, filtered through Lila's POV to mirror internal persistence, constraining choices like pausing at the arbor for signals. Atmosphere evolves with moonlight snagging on the trellis, charging the final gathering image under fired-clay faces. The micro-setting of the arbor directly shapes the closure by hosting the crate and circle, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sustaining community amid sanctions tightens through Tomasz's question, deepening via Lila's explanation of nourishment as inheritance, with agency in her declaration foreclosing despair at conceptual cost. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, cadence shifts at the gathering reweight stakes effectively, though coincidence in the crate's arrival complicates without fully resolving. One meaningful deepening suffices, with moral calculus between endurance and hope sharpening the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of quiet persistence building intergenerational hope emerges organically from bell signals, donations, and seeds, with subtext in gestures like flour-dusted fingers and the bell's kiss. The final image of seeds as "not gifts; they are" offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing, reweighting exile's premise. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Lila's biased noticing of sounds and scents amplifying quiet; voice texture is distinct with rhythmic, poetic syntax like "a sound so soft it was almost the memory of sound." Dialogue pursues goals naturally, with subtext in Tomasz's whisper and Lila's iron-and-honey response, distinguishing idioms without convergence. Elision in the unfinished final sentence teaches pattern and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and character via strong verbs and specific images like "moon hung low enough to snag on the arbor’s broken trellis," varying rhythm naturally without loops or artifacts. Figurative language integrates purposefully, avoiding muddle in peaks, with the final line's propulsion recharging motifs. Zero scaffold or redundancy, meeting the 9+ test fully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise of anonymous donations as secret curriculum in exile offers fresh synthesis, transforming tropes of survival through specific details like the bell's border-crossing history and saffron's scent. Risk in the poetic, unfinished ending heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable without gimmickry. Avoids derivative templates, with emotional specificity in declarations avoiding generics.</comment>
