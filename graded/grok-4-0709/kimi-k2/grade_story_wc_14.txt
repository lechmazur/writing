<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liang's earnestly studious nature drives concrete micro-choices, like pressing his palm to the lamp and annotating the hum, revealing contradictory impulses of panic and methodical preservation; this culminates in an earned stasis where he accepts the silence's cost while refracting memories, with embodied emotion in the notepad's warmth against his ribs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elisions and textural densities toward a resonant reconfiguration in the final descent, with conceptual cost legible in the silence's thickening yet luminous restraint; orientation anchors early in the blooming labyrinth, and the notepad's stirring like moth wings charges the closure image without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth constrains Liang's choices, with glowing moss and trembling leaves mirroring his refraction process and charging the final image of trees as chapters; sensory details like cedar sap and dew smelling of green tea are POV-filtered and evolve causally, heightening atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving textures escalates through textural deepening as the hum fades, forcing stance crystallization in speaking aloud market memories; one meaningful cadence shift narrows options with felt cost in the lamp's dimming, though coincidence of the wind's echo slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of invented histories as lanterns emerges organically from particulars like the hum's translation into phrases, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer that reweights silence as incandescent; subtext in textures like moth wings invites reflection on loss without moralizing, embracing complexity in longing's prism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual signature in texture-focused noticing, like hum pooling as color; prose texture in rhythmic, purposeful syntax heightens pressure, with elision of town details taught early and paid off in closure; no dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, multi-job sentences like the lamp's hum thinning into a question, free of loops or artifacts; rhythmic variety accelerates in the writing beat and breathes at dawn's blush, propelling toward closure without overwriting or muddle in peak moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence and refraction transforms familiar loss tropes through specific details like annotating hum pitches, feeling inevitable in the notepad's luminescence; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise with non-obvious restraint.</comment>
