<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to safeguard innovation is clear and intensifies through her decision to plant the seed, revealing contradictory impulses of fear and tenderness that culminate in her earned renunciation of control. Interiority is concrete and embodied, as in her palm on the pulsing stalk, showing flaws like possessiveness that complicate choices without tidy resolution. The final whisper "Grow" forecloses certainty with felt cost, visible in her smile amid forgetting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery of seeds, mirrors, and silence, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the haven merges with the maze, reweighting stakes with conceptual cost of lost certainty. Orientation anchors early with the envelope at dusk and the lodge beside the brook. Closure lands on-page with the door ajar and brook's new key, charging the final image without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven beside the quiet brook is vividly specific, with sensory details like the brook's murmur and corpse flower's carrion-thunder scent constraining Mara's choices, such as planting in the courtyard. Atmosphere evolves causally, mirroring her internal shift from hush to storm-born silence. The setting charges the final image, as the merged organism and ajar door reconfigure possibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of safeguarding innovation tightens through the seed's ripple and dream-induced changes, deepening to force Mara's stance crystallization in surrendering control, with felt cost of forgetting certainty. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern breaks like the flower's eruption escalate pressure coherently. Agency drives the climax via her key dissolution, narrowing options without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of letting innovation escape to safeguard it emerges organically from Mara's evolving puzzles and the seed's influence, culminating in a resonant final image of the ajar door that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in images like orthogonal corridors invites reflection on possibility's cost. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through her fierce tenderness for unsolved locks.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-bound, with perceptual signature in Mara's receptive noticing of tremors and scents. Prose texture is distinct, with rhythmic syntax like "each step a question, each breath a wager" modulating under pressure. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; elision in dream sequences is patterned and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, as sentences like "petals that stank of carrion and thunder" advance atmosphere and stakes without loops. Rhythm varies naturally, though some figurative stacks in peak beats like the flower's eruption border on overwriting without muddling clarity. No artifacts obscure closure; final line propels resonance through concrete image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise of a mystery seed transforming an escape room into a living puzzle offers fresh synthesis, with orthogonal approaches and storm-born silence heightening stakes organically. Risk-taking in lyric, accumulative structure elevates ingenuity without gimmickry, feeling inevitable as the flower reveals impossible rooms. Transformation of tropes like puzzles and innovation avoids derivatives through specific, mystical evolution.</comment>
