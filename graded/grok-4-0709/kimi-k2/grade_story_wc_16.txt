<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to save the archive through reckless promises is clear and rooted in her silence after exposing a lie, intensifying to compel her high-stakes writing; interiority is concrete via embodied actions like dipping the stylus, though emotions lean poetic rather than deeply contradictory in scene. The meaningful endurance of her plan forecloses forgetting with felt cost in her broken silence, as seen in her first words tasting like starlight. Relationships with Arden and archivists pressure choices, altering dynamics by the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under a Hybrid lens (causal dominant at closure), the structure builds through motivated actions like writing promises that cause music and gatherings, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the archive is saved with conceptual cost of shattered trust reframed. Orientation anchors early in the archive beneath the university; one meaningful tightening occurs as music draws Arden and archivists, narrowing options to confrontation at dawn. Closure lands on-page with the ink well shattered, reweighting paths from divergence to convergence, though ellipsis in demolition pause feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The extinct language archive is vividly anchored with dust like constellations and cedar scents, constraining Lira's choices through its demolition threat and resources like tablets; sensory details are selective and POV-biased, evolving as the building breathes and sings. A recurring object (glass ink well) charges the final image by shattering into chiming fragments, reweighting the premise with trust as a symphony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of saving the archive from demolition is signaled early, tightening meaningfully as promises manifest music that draws allies, forcing Arden's stance crystallization under coherent pressure. One deepening narrows options, with visible cost in Lira's risked silence and the archive's potential loss; escalation reads as causal linkages raising redemption's price, though coincidence of crews pausing complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of unsnarling silence into symphonies of truth emerges organically from Lira's promises and music, inviting reflection on memory versus forgetting through ambiguity in Arden's fear; final image of teaching "Listen" offers a resonant, non-literal answer reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like the melody brushing Arden's wrist deepens complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV (Lira's) is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic noticing like violet liquid pulsing; voice texture is rhythmic and purposeful, with patterned elision in music metaphors taught early and paid off at closure. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances plot, as in Arden's admission and Lira's starlight-tasting reply; psychic distance shifts intentionally under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing through vivid images like dust constellations without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, though some metaphors (e.g., fear as silence with teeth) border on mixed without muddling clarity. No artifacts obscure closure, with strong verbs and syntactic variety propelling to the chiming fragments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of encoding truths in singing ink to bind promises transforms trope of magical artifacts through specific, non-obvious synthesis with linguistic vows, feeling inevitable as music unsnarls silence; risk-taking in reckless weaving heightens stakes organically, as in shattering the ink well for a bold, memorable closure.</comment>
