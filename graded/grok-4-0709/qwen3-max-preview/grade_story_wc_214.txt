<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cosmic janitor's motivation to find strength in vulnerability is clear and intensifies through empathetic tracing of stars, with interior contradictions embodied in his emotional surrender to the comet's bloom. Backstory anchors effectively via the yellow lantern glass cue, tilting his present stance without excess. Flaws like his past hollowing from endless destruction complicate choices, leading to an earned stasis with felt cost in tears and recognition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through reflective shards to a resonant reconfiguration in the comet's efflorescence, with conceptual cost legible in the janitor's exhaled recognition. Orientation anchors who (janitor), where (tracking station), and when (overlooked era) by line 3, waiving any penalty. One meaningful deepening suffices, but the closure lacks a more decisive physical micro-turn, capping at high band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The shooting star tracking station's crystalline floor and analog dials constrain choices, charging the final sweeping image with tactile reverence. Sensory details like whispering broom and velvet dark are selective, POV-biased toward spiritual curiosity, mirroring internal release without overt symbolism. Micro-setting of the yellow lantern glass evolves causally, fulfilling the 9+ test by shaping the closure's empathy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of seeking flourishing stillness tightens through the comet's plunge, forcing stance crystallization with felt emotional cost in tears, driven by agency in empathetic tracing. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, one cadence shift reweights vulnerability as strength, but coincidence of the unlogged comet complicates without fully resolving, limiting escalation depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of flourishing stillness emerges organically from the janitor's empathetic actions and the comet's bloom, offering a resonant, non-literal repricing of entropy as release without stated moral. Subtext in silence and surrender invites reflection on impermanence, with emotional honesty avoiding sentimentality. The final image reweights prior motifs like the lantern glass, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-specific, with perceptual signature biased toward spiritual empathy, as in feeling the comet's path inward. Lyrical voice modulates rhythm under pressure, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; syntactic variety heightens the hush, meeting 9+ with rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose density advances atmosphere through vivid images like "sky wept embers," with rhythmic variety in sentence lengths creating propulsion without loops. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the comet's unraveling. Minor scaffold in repetitive "he" stems deducts slightly, but high information and clarity at closure hold strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic janitor as empathetic witness transforms familiar entropy tropes through specific spiritual curiosity and vulnerability motif, feeling inevitable in the comet's bloom. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, with non-obvious angle on stillness as strength. Proximity check clears; ingenuity charges the quiet ending boldly.</comment>
