<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The potter's motivation to understand resistance to change is clear and intensifies through gentle, embodied actions like molding clay and offering water, revealing contradictory impulses of surrender and creation; interiority is concrete, with emotions embodied in breaths and thrums, culminating in an earned stasis of recognition with felt cost of leaving the vessel unfired. Strengths include character-specific perceptions under pressure, like tracing the kiln rim, avoiding stock phrasing. A minor slip is the occasional abstract summary of emotions, but it doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and patterns, with orientation anchored early in the oasis setting; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration via the final image of the pot glowing and time curling upward, with conceptual cost of embracing fractures. One meaningful deepening occurs as the thrum syncs with her breath and the bee's wings, reweighting the stake. Minor orientation waiver not needed as anchors are clear by 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The scorched wasteland and abandoned hives provide vivid, purposeful sensory details filtered through the potter's zen bias, with elements like sagging frames and pooled wax constraining her choices and charging the final image of the pot in dust; atmosphere evolves causally, mirroring internal surrender. A recurring object like the lantern glass integrates into the micro-setting, enhancing resonance without overbreadth. This constrains the closure by cradling the glass, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding resistance escalates through textural density increase, with a cadence shift in the thrum and visions forcing stance crystallization on surrender; agency via renunciation forecloses haste, with felt cost in the unfired vessel's porosity. One meaningful deepening suffices, driven by her micro-choices like pouring water. Coincidence of the bee complicates but doesn't resolve, aligning with Situational elements in Hybrid lens, though cost is oblique at times.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of kindness coaxing coherence from fractured time emerges organically through images like the bee drinking and the glowing glass, offering a resonant, non-literal answer in the final reconfiguration without moralizing; subtext in gestures like not firing the kiln embraces complexity. Emotional aftereffect lingers via purposeful ambiguity in preservation as transformation. The ending reweights prior material subtly, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in selective noticing of thrums and iridescence, biased by zen gentleness; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax that modulates with emotional intensity, teaching patterned elision early. No dialogue, so policy applies; no head-hopping. Rhythmic control under pressure heightens the thrum without obscurity, meeting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally in sentences like "time curled upward again — tender, unbroken, humming," advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere without muddle, even in peak beats. Zero artifacts touch closure, with strong verbs and specific nouns propelling momentum. Information density high, meeting 9+ test despite minor simultaneity in one descriptive line not harming clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fractured timelines and phototropic kindness transforms familiar wasteland tropes through specific zen pottery and bee echoes, feeling inevitable in the unfired vessel; risk in lyric structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generics, with authenticity in gentle defiance. A non-obvious angle on entropy elevates, though premise echoes poetic sci-fi lightly.</comment>
