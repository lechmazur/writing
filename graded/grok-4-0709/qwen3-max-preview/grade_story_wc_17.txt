<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to discover what walls dream about is clear and intensifies through her sensitive perception, leading to earned endurance in leaving the sketch, with visible emotional cost in her heavier heart. Interiority is concrete and embodied, showing contradictory impulses like trembling fingers amid calm listening, without stock phrasing. The final renunciation of capturing the glowing negative forecloses a path, charged by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through perceptual shards in one continuous scene, with orientation anchored by the first sentence in who (cartographer), where (ivy-veiled passage), and when (post-climate shifts). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise in the exhaling passage and her clearer purpose, with felt conceptual cost in shared legacy's burden. One meaningful deepening occurs at discovering the diaries, reweighting knowledge without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage is vividly specific, with sensory details like whispering leaves and pulsing tendrils filtered through her perceptive bias, constraining choices like kneeling to listen. The post-climate shift timeframe evolves consistently, mirroring her internal mourning, and the fireplace as micro-setting charges the final image by housing the diaries and sketch. Tone tensions melancholy with subtle hope, supporting theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering walls' dreams signals early and deepens via the diaries' discovery, forcing stance crystallization in her decision to witness rather than record, with felt emotional cost in breath catching. Under Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates through perceptual intensifications like the sob and glowing negative, narrowing options without coincidence resolving. Agency in renunciation charges the quiet ending, though secondary stakes remain minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of legacy's burden emerges organically through images like charred diaries and exhaling ivy, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in stone's forgiveness. Subtext in gestures like brushing ash and moonlight's scalpel invites reflection on loss without confusion, culminating in a resonant final image repricing the premise non-literally. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality via concrete particulars like the sob against limestone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature in bone-vibrating sensitivity and biased noticing of murmurs in plaster. Voice texture is distinct and lyrical, with rhythmic syntax modulating under emotional intensity, like short sentences at the sigh and sob. No dialogue present, so not evaluated; purposeful compression in descriptions teaches pattern and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm through sentence length and purposeful fragments like "A sigh. Then a sob. Then silence." No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle; metaphors like sleeping serpent and scalpel moonlight are coherent and advance atmosphere. Opening anchors voice, final line recharges motifs with propulsion intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of echo cartography in a post-climate world feels inevitable, transforming eco-mourning tropes through specific choices like undeveloped negative as talisman. Bold risk in quiet, perceptual structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise's implications. Fresh inflection in walls exhaling reweights legacy organically.</comment>
