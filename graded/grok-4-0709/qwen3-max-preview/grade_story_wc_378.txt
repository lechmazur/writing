<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The android's motivation to resolve inner static is clear and intensifies through concrete micro-choices, like opening the box and igniting fears, revealing contradictory impulses of nostalgia and transformation. Interiority is embodied in creaking joints and pulsing roses, avoiding stock phrasing, with the final endurance earning wholeness at the felt cost of the burn. Flaws like coded nostalgia complicate choices without hedging, and the resolution confronts them through integration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with patterned imagery building to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the burn and synchronization, delivering conceptual cost via transformation legible in the final image. Orientation anchors early in the dome amid the magnetic shift, with one meaningful deepening as fears transmute without causality breaks. Single POV and continuous scene fit scope, though minor elision in the burn's mechanics slightly softens traceability without harming closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like crimson sand and bioglass veins anchor the dome early, with the environment constraining choices during the storm and charging the final image of petals taking root. Sensory hierarchy reflects the android's urgency, mirroring internal states through the trembling glass and swaying roses without overt symbolism. Micro-setting of the inner garden evolves causally, guiding the transformation with tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resolving inner static amid the magnetic shift tightens once through the burn, narrowing options and reweighting cost under the Accumulative lens, with agency in the controlled ignition forcing stance crystallization. Visible price in the blue flames transmuting limbs charges the ending, though coincidence of the planetary sigh slightly complicates without resolving. One deepening suffices, interweaving internal conflict authentically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transformation over preservation emerges organically from images like the burning fears and blooming petals, offering a resonant, non-literal answer in the final reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like the grown smile and drifting petals invites reflection on integrating chaos, with emotional honesty avoiding sentimentality. Purposeful ambiguity lingers in the dormant children, tied inextricably to the android's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV maintains controlled distance, with perceptual signature biased toward mechanical-organic fusion in selective noticing of pulses and static. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, patterned diction that modulates with pressure, teaching compression early and paying off at closure. No dialogue or head-hopping, and purposeful elision in the burn enhances emotional beats without withholding known facts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density and propulsion shine in multi-job sentences like "Flames, blue and silent, licked up its synthetic limbs," with varied rhythm and no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the ignition. Clarity in grammar and sequence supports momentum, with the final line recharging motifs through image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of android nostalgia and fear compression transforms sci-fi tropes through specific details like bioglass veins and the controlled burn, feeling inevitable with risk-taking in poetic structure heightening stakes. Core premise offers a non-obvious angle on trauma, committing fully without hedging. Emotional specificity avoids generics, with the fragmented wholeness cohering as a singular vision.</comment>
