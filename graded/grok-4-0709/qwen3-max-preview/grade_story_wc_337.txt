<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The restorer's motivation for balance and grounding spirits is clear and intensifies through her reverent actions, with embodied emotions like trembling fingers and hesitation at the blackened knot revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. Interiority is concrete and particular, showing flaws in her methodical approach without stock phrasing. The final endurance forecloses unrest with felt cost, as the sanctuary's peace comes at the price of her ongoing, unrestful work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through knot-by-knot unravelings with density increase leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the sanctuary's exhaled peace, with conceptual cost in the perpetual work. Orientation anchors who (restorer), where (prism sanctuary), and when (night under starlight) by the first 50 words. Closure lands on-page with the net coiled and her departure, reweighting the premise of silence as healing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is vividly specific, with facets bending starlight into liquid whispers that pool and hum, constraining choices by crystallizing silence and charging the final image of warmer, clearer light. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, reflecting her urgency in the cold stone and pulsing prisms. The setting evolves causally, dimming during the scream-knot and settling into peace, mirroring her internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grounding spirits tightens meaningfully at the blackened knot, forcing a hesitant pierce that narrows options and raises cost in the roaring gale, under the Accumulative lens. Agency in her unraveling forecloses unrest with visible price in the sanctuary's shake and her stiff joints. Coherent pressure crystallizes her stance without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence as layered and healing emerges organically from unraveling actions and shimmering spirits, with subtext in sighs and flickers inviting reflection on loss without tidy morals. The final image of the sanctuary's sigh offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of quiet as grace. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through complex ambiguity in her unrestful certainty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature in her bias toward silence's layers and moon-silk details. Lyrical voice has distinct texture in rhythmic, patterned diction that modulates with pressure, teaching compression early. No dialogue present, so not evaluated; psychic distance shifts intentionally serve emotional beats like the hesitation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in sentence and paragraph lengths that accelerate during unravelings; metaphors like "knots swollen with salt and silence" are coherent and purposeful without muddle. Zero loops or scaffold, high information density advances atmosphere and character. Opening anchors voice, final line recharges motifs with the future still knotted.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mask restoration and spirit-grounding via net-unraveling feels inevitable, transforming tropes of ghosts and relics through specific, grounded choices like the scream-knot's betrayal. Bold risk in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in relief as tide retreating avoids generics, committing to the premise's implications.</comment>
