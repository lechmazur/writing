<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation to harvest lessons from loss is clear and rooted in her traits, intensifying through micro-choices like ignoring the kettle to carve, revealing contradictory impulses of grief and practicality. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with emotions like crystallized grief shown through actions rather than labels, leading to an earned stasis in the final placement of the carving. The line "She wasn’t sculpting memory; she was trying to contain it" exemplifies her hierarchy of values with visible cost, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through reflective shards anchored in the present, with one meaningful deepening via the carving process leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where grief is reweighted as containable, with felt cost in the scorched kettle and emotional residue. Orientation anchors who (Eleanor), where (loft), and when (rainy afternoon) by the first sentence, waiving any penalty. The ending's resonant reconfiguration lands on-page with the carving's placement, though a slightly more decisive cadence shift could elevate it further.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft is vividly specific, with sensory details like wet cedar and weeping window integrated into action, constraining choices by providing a humid, isolated space that mirrors Eleanor's internal containment. The setting evolves with thinning clouds and watery gold light, charging the final image on the windowsill. Micro-setting elements like the chisel and blank function as tools that directly shape the closure, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of containing grief escalates through a cadence shift in the carving beats, deepening to crystallize time and foreclose retreat into shadow, with visible cost in ignored practicalities like the boiling kettle. Agency manifests in renunciation (letting the pot scorch) that reweights options, though coincidence of rain softening complicates without resolving. The tightening is meaningful but could narrow options more sharply for higher escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of loss as a lens for wisdom emerges organically from images like the carving and rain beads, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in "here and gone but never lost." Subtext in gestures like peeling wood curls and the resting lion offers resonant reconfiguration without statement. The final image provides a non-literal answer to containing grief, reweighting prior motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with clean free indirect style, perceptual signature biased toward sensory echoes of loss (e.g., sawdust and blood scents). Prose texture in rhythmic, purposeful syntax reflects Eleanor's contemplative state, with no dialogue to evaluate. Elision of time in reflections is taught early and paid off at closure, meeting the 9+ test without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the kettle's "shrill punctuation" advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, with no artifacts obscuring closure; information propels through images like "watery gold" charging the end. Read-aloud flow is natural, with zero redundancy meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise of a widow carving grief into containment offers fresh synthesis of circus loss and practical haunting, transforming tropes through specific details like the resting lion echo. Risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the final reconfiguration. No close echoes of famous works, though emotional truth could push bolder ambiguity for higher ingenuity.</comment>
