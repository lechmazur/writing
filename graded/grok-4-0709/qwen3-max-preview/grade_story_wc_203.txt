<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation for discovery is clear and intensifies through patient observation, culminating in the earned stasis of acknowledging the ghost; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses like curiosity and quiet responsibility shown in his handling of the drawing and button. However, the daughter's photo feels like a token emotional anchor without fully complicating his choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through observational shards to a resonant reconfiguration in the final sigh and departure, with conceptual cost legible in the weightless burden; orientation anchors early via the technician in the ticket office, and one meaningful deepening occurs via the ceiling discovery. Minor ellipsis in ghost interaction slightly softens causality without breaking the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is vividly specific, with sensory details like popcorn smell and dust patterns constraining choices and charging the final image of the water drop; moonlight and dust evolve causally, mirroring internal neglect and discovery without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering hidden stories tightens once through the ceiling pry, forcing a stance crystallization with felt cost in his lingering responsibility; pressure accumulates texturally via dust patterns and ghost silhouette, though coincidence in the sigh complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of witnessing neglected stories emerges organically from images like the drawing and swirling dust, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final vigil without moralizing; subtext in silences and implications deepens complexity, avoiding tidy resolutions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in selective noticing of dust and reflections; prose texture modulates rhythmically under pressure, with purposeful compression in ghost encounter paying off at closure. Single line of dialogue ("I see you") carries subtext effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel atmosphere; metaphors like dust as fleeing children are coherent and purposeful, avoiding loops or artifacts, though one paraphrase loop in reflection slightly dulls momentum without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-hunting via horologist tool and dust analysis transforms familiar haunted setting tropes through specific observational ingenuity; risk in quiet, introspective closure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
