<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to grieve lost scents is rooted in consistent traits like aromatic caution, intensifying through embodied emotions that compel her to open the vial; interior conflict shines in contradictory impulses during the memory avalanche, with the final renunciation of fear earned by prior causality and visible emotional cost. A pivotal moment is her knees buckling not from scent strength but memory's weight, revealing character through embodied reaction. Flaws like fear of beauty complicate choices without hedging, leading to an authentic transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through reflective shards in one continuous greenhouse scene, with orientation anchored early via the broker's solitude and purpose; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration via Conceptual Repricing, reweighting grief as memory's guardian with felt emotional cost in her weeping and changed state. The meaningful deepening occurs when UV light reveals glyphs, shifting cadence and reweighting stakes without causal breaks. Minor elision in backstory anchors cleanly via the vial cue, tilting present stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse for extinct plants anchors where and when early, with vivid, selective sensory details like moss-stained tiles and spectral petals that reflect the protagonist's grief; setting constrains choices by providing a preserved space for revelation, charging the final image as her cathedral. Micro-details like glass panes and filtered sun mirror internal states through action, evolving causally with the perfume's release. For 9+, the environment charges the closure by enabling the UV revelation and transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><grade>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant emotional stake of understanding grief signals early and deepens through a cadence shift when glyphs emerge, reweighting options with the cost of piercing joy's absence; agency via renunciation forecloses fear with felt cost in her open weeping. One meaningful intensification suffices, driven by her choice to use the lamp, narrowing paths to transformation without coincidence resolving. Moral calculus between pain and beauty sharpens the peak, though stakes remain largely internal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory's guardianship through grief emerges organically from images like dissolving glyphs and the vial's resonance, inviting reflection via purposeful ambiguity in smells bypassing thought; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by repricing grief as curator without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like trembling precision and flickering lanterns enriches complexity. Epiphany earns through specific struggle with the Midnight Heliotrope scent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward aromatic details and embodied memory; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, purposeful syntax that modulates with intensity, like short breaths in the avalanche moment. No dialogue, so policy skips; free indirect style clean, shifting distance intentionally for emotional beats. For 9+, distinct signature and control under pressure hold, with no elision or hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density and propulsion with varied rhythm, concise sentences advancing atmosphere and character, like the vial shimmering "faceted like frozen tears"; no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts, with strong verbs and specific nouns avoiding overwrites. Figurative language coherent and purposeful, enhancing momentum without muddle in peak beats like glyph revelation. Opening anchors voice; final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lantern brokering with extinct plant grief and UV-revealed memories feels inevitable, transforming tropes like lost scents into a fresh angle on nostalgia; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes via emotional specificity without gimmickry. Core premise commits fully, with non-obvious reconfiguration at closure. Proximity check clears; authenticity coheres as singular vision.</comment>
