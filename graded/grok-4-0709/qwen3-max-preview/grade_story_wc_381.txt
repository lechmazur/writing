<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The summoner's motivation to hush the prophecy is clear and intensifies through her ritual, rooted in traits like flow and surrender, leading to an earned shift from silencing to listening with a felt cost of ongoing duty. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with emotions shown through synced breath and heartbeat, avoiding stock phrasing. However, internal conflict lacks sharp contradictory impulses in scene, trending toward harmonious resolution without visible flaws complicating choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered imagery and resonance to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the prophecy softens and the wing ascends, with conceptual cost in the summoner's reframed role. Orientation anchors who (summoner), where (brookside haven), and when (nocturnal) by the first paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the whisper reveals the plea, reweighting knowledge without causality breaks, though the pattern could teach its elision more explicitly early on.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven beside the quiet brook is vividly specific, with sensory details like water's murmur as texture and moonlight draping in silver, filtered through the summoner's biased perception. Setting constrains choices, as the brook enables the ritual and mirrors internal hush, charging the final image of the wing spiraling upward. Atmosphere supports the tranquil yet cosmic tone, evolving causally with the glowing runes and stars leaning closer.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preventing the sky's forgetting is signaled early and deepens texturally when the whisper reweights it as a plea, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in her perpetual listening role. Pressure coheres through accumulating silence and resonance, with one meaningful cadence shift narrowing options from force to cradling. Coincidence in the wing's resonance complicates but does not resolve, though agency feels more observational than decisive in peak moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as a space for understanding emerges organically from images like mapping stillness and the prophecy's softening edges, inviting reflection on listening without tidy morals. Subtext operates in implications of breath and pauses, culminating in a resonant final image of the crane vanishing into dark that reweights the premise non-literally. Emotional aftereffect is concrete tranquility with underlying purpose, avoiding sentimentality through complexity in the prophecy's plea.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature in selective noticing of cosmic rhythms and moss breaths, modulating rhythm under pressure like slowed breath matching the brook. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax and word choice, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. No dialogue present, so ignored; no head-hopping or unwarranted certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, high information density in metaphors like "velvet void where meaning pooled," advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though occasional density in peak beats like the wing's pulsing borders on muddle without harming clarity. Final line resolves by recharging the origami motif effectively; no artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of summoner lore with textural silence-mapping feels inevitable, transforming fantasy tropes through specific, cosmic-terrestrial imagery like drowned bells and lullaby constellations. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to a singular vision of hush as guardianship. Fresh inflection in the prophecy's plea reconfiguration arises from particulars, avoiding derivatives.</comment>
