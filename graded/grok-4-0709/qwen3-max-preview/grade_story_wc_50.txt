<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The locksmith's motivation to preserve wonder is clear and intensifies through concrete actions like aligning mirrors and recording sketches, revealing interior contradictions in his reverence for periphery without direct confrontation. Emotions are embodied in tactile interactions, such as brushing dust or collecting shards, showing a hierarchy of values with felt cost in his deliberate patience. The character's flaws, like avoiding direct stares to prevent blinding, complicate choices and culminate in an earned stasis at closure, where he leaves without looking back, foreclosing fame for quiet preservation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered reflections and images, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the sealed cavern preserves wonder with conceptual cost of isolation. Orientation anchors who (locksmith), where (marble cavern), and when (wounded season) by the first paragraph, with no disorientation debt. Closure lands on-page via the final image of fermented wonder, reweighting prior echoes with undeniable pressure, though a more persistent constraint could elevate it further.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The marble cavern setting is vivid and purposeful, with quartz veins and condensation constraining choices like light angles and shard collection, directly charging the final image of preserved resonance. Sensory details, filtered through the locksmith's peripheral gaze, evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism, and the environment pressures actions like the stalactite crack. Micro-setting elements like the timer mechanism function as setting extensions, enhancing specificity and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of preserving wonder escalates through density increases in revelations, like the glyph at 11:03 and tone at dusk, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in emotional shards. One meaningful deepening suffices, as the timer shudders and emits a tone, narrowing options toward closure, though agency leans more toward endurance than decisive action. Coincidence in light shafts complicates but does not resolve, maintaining coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of wonder as a preservable nutrient emerges organically from images like echoes in gears and resin slabs, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in peripheral glimpses and emotional resonances, inviting reflection on intuition versus logic with purposeful ambiguity. The core concept integrates through specific events, like the stalactite crack, eliciting an aftereffect of quiet awe.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature in peripheral focus and biased noticing of glimmers, modulating rhythm under pressure like the dusk tone. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax and word choice, teaching patterned elision early for lyric effect that pays off at closure. No head-hopping or dialogue, but free indirect style cleanly conveys interiority without filter-verb excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with multifaceted sentences advancing atmosphere and character, like "echoes? Those were physics wearing poetry’s coat," without loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in revelations and breathing in reflections, with vivid metaphors coherent and voice-motivated. No artifacts obscure closure, and final line recharges motifs through image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of reverse-engineering wonder via echoes and angles offers fresh synthesis, transforming tropes of time and memory through specific, idiosyncratic details like emotional temperature slabs. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight, as the cavern's preservation reconfigures isolation into legacy. Authenticity coheres in a singular poetic vision, avoiding stock elements.</comment>
