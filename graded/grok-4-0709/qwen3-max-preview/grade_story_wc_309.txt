<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increasing through whispered incantations and image patterns, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing closure where Lior's realization reweights magic's premise with the conceptual cost of abandoning managed spells for remembered wonder. Orientation anchors early in the icebound spire, with deliberate mist disorientation paying off at the cloud hollow to charge the final image. Structure fits Track A defaults as a single POV with one journey shard and legible transition, building one meaningful deepening via the mist walk that changes knowledge. Closure lands on-page with undeniable pressure in the blooming tree and Lior's weeping, shaped by the keystone's persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the icebound spire's eternal frost and glowing rime constraining Lior's isolation and choices, evolving causally into the mist path and cloud hollow. Sensory details are selective and POV-biased, like ozone-tasting breaths reflecting his thawing failure, balanced across senses to heighten atmosphere without overload. The micro-setting of the keystone and apple tree charges the final image, mirroring internal states through jasmine blooms and radiant doors. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, with environment guiding action like gravity softening near the stone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming wonder signals early in Lior's refusal to adapt, with one meaningful deepening via the mist walk that narrows options and forces stance crystallization under the Accumulative lens. Pressure coheres and escalates through coherent internal forces, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses his old path with felt cost in weeping and leaving the keystone. Agency drives the unstrapping action, enabling the journey without coincidence resolving it. Moral calculus sharpens the choice between managed magic and impossible simplicity, with visible price altering his return tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of rediscovering magic's wonder emerges organically from events like the keystone's impossibilities and the tree's memory doors, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in Lior's ongoing rejections. Subtext operates in images like glowing fruit and folded light, inviting reflection on automation's sterility without confusion. Epiphany is earned through the journey's struggle, eliciting emotional aftereffect via the resonant final image of imperfect charms shared. The ending offers a non-literal answer to finding the sacred in the simple, reweighting prior material like his botched apprenticeships.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward Lior's whimsical failures, like tasting laughter in magic. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic syntax, modulating with intensity in the mist walk's pearlescent veils. Dialogue is natural and subtextual, with the light figure's chimes advancing the plot through implication.
