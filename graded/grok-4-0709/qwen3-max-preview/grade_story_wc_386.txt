<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to salvage pure echoes from wreckage is clear and intensifies through her careful weaving of truth, shown in embodied actions like tracing the globe's rim and placing it in the ice frame. Interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions embodied in her faint smile and non-weeping release, revealing a hierarchy of values focused on mending over personal gain. A strength is the earned stasis in her ongoing dives, foreclosing fame for quiet purpose with felt conceptual cost. The character's flaws, like her isolation, complicate choices without artificial balance, though internal contradictions could be more simultaneous in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of windows and dreams, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration when the globe is placed, releasing the sigh and reweighting the child's promise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors who (ghost whisperer), where (glacier shrine), and when (night to dawn) within the first 120 words, with no disorientation debt. The single-shard scene with mosaic dream extensions fits Track B, teaching the pattern early via cameo mappings and holding the lens to closure. A key strength is the final image's charged poise, refracting starlight into ripples, though one more explicit tightening could elevate causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The glacier ice shrine is vividly anchored with blue-veined walls and candle flames, selectively filtered through the protagonist's perceptual bias toward borrowed starlight and glacial crevasses. Sensory details like breath curling like incense and the globe's unnatural warmth are purposeful, mirroring internal wonder and release while constraining choices, such as carving the recess to enable the reconfiguration. Atmosphere tensions the tone of quiet exorcism, evolving causally as ice ripples in relief, charging the final window-within-window image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, with the eastern wall recess guiding the climax without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><grade>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of salvaging the child's uncorrupted echo signals early and deepens through dream analysis, culminating in a cadence shift that reweights options with the release's conceptual cost. Pressure coheres via internal tightening, narrowing from listening to realization and placement, foreclosing haunting for mending with felt price in the sigh and fading cameos. Agency shines in her micro-choices, like palms on the altar sinking into memory, driving the stance crystallization without coincidence resolving. While one meaningful deepening suffices, the low external antagonism limits escalation intensity, though moral calculus between truth and wounding sharpens the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of fragile connections mending through careful truth emerges organically from images like windows of connection and the globe's reformed streets, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in ripples' unknowable effects. Subtext operates in implications of the child's wonder over terror and the whisperer's non-weeping smile, inviting reflection on salvage without confusion. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to preserving purity, reweighting the premise via conceptual repricing of drowning as protection. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality, eliciting aftereffect through particulars like the widow's ashes-scattering whisper.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward dream mappings and glacial echoes, modulating rhythm from contemplative breaths to dawn's violet bleed. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax and word choice like "blue-veined ice" and "borrowed starlight," with purposeful compression in mosaic dream shards taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or elision obscures; focalization controls time and space, with inference as inference in the child's final moments. Narrative stance coheres as singular, heightening emotional beats without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density and propulsion with rhythmic variety, such as varying sentence lengths from the opening kneel to the sigh's echo, advancing atmosphere and character without loops or scaffold. Clarity shines in concise images like "snowflakes swirl in suspended animation," with strong verbs and specific nouns avoiding modifiers or muddle in peak beats. No artifacts like synonym churn or template cadence; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, enhancing momentum in the rippling ice. The final line resolves by recharging motifs, with read-aloud flow natural and integrated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes wreck-diving with ghost whispering through dream cameos and glacial shrines, offering a fresh angle on loss and connection via windows as thresholds, feeling inevitable in the globe's placement. Originality elevates in non-obvious inflections like exposing silence via strangers' dreams, transforming tropes with specific details such as the child's "You'll be safe" whisper. Risk-taking in mosaic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, cohering as authentic vision. While echoing poetic ghost tales, transformation through conceptual repricing avoids derivative pitfalls.</comment>
