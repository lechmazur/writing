<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to navigate gentrification is clear and intensifies through her dual allegiance, with embodied emotion in moments like the stone chip warming against her thigh revealing internal conflict; however, her flaws feel slightly balanced for thematic convenience without deeper irrationality under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and motifs to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final gathering, with conceptual cost in postponed privatization; orientation anchors early, but some elisions feel more poetic than pressure-driven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The raft city's vivid, sensory details—neon lights, salt-stained wood, and monsoon rain—constrain Lira's choices and charge the final mural image, with micro-setting like the carousel horse enhancing atmospheric specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resisting gentrification tightens through Lira's reorganizing actions, with one meaningful deepening in the climax mural forcing stance crystallization; cost is felt in her aching dual allegiance, though coincidence in the gathering slightly softens agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of communal resistance emerges organically from graffiti subtext and images like the phoenix from eviction notices, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights memory without moralizing; ambiguity lingers meaningfully in the postponed defeat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in Lira's mapping of chaos; prose rhythm modulates with pressure, as in swift brushstrokes guided by intuition, with no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, propulsion-driven sentences like "contracts slither through alleyways like eels," varying rhythm naturally without loops or artifacts; final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of floating carnival and gentrification resistance through encoded graffiti transforms tropes, with risk in lyric structure heightening stakes; the foundation stone chip as a pulsing relic feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
