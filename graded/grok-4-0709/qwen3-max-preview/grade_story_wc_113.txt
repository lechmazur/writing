<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The musician's motivation to decode the program's secrets is clear and intensifies through embodied actions, like mirroring the ghost's gestures, revealing contradictory impulses in her reverence and resolve; interiority is concrete, with emotions shown through skin-level listening and trembling arms, earning the final renunciation of silence with visible cost in her emptied lungs and full heart.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of water and silence to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final fermata, with conceptual cost legible in the humming silence; orientation anchors early in the flooded pit, but minor ellipsis in correlating stains feels slightly unmotivated without tighter linkage to her arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The flooded opera house is vividly specific, with ankle-deep water, floating chairs, and rust-weeping balconies constraining her wading and angling of the lantern, charging the final image as the pit exhales and water warms; sensory details like vibrating water and shimmering glyphs are purposeful, mirroring her internal resonance without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling the ghost's code tightens through one meaningful deepening when the face emerges and gestures begin, forcing her stance crystallization in the invisible playing; cost is felt in her trembling and breath-holding, but coincidence of the ghost's appearance slightly complicates without fully resolving pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of finding truth in absences and silences emerges organically from images like unstruck chords and water-damaged music, culminating in a resonant final image where the in-between spaces sing without literal moralizing; subtext in wordless gestures invites reflection on memory and decay, with emotional aftereffect honest and unsentimental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in her skin-level listening and memory-filtered details; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, flowing syntax that modulates with pressure, like shortening in the climax; no dialogue, but purposeful compression in lyric mode teaches patterns early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and resonance without loops or scaffold; rhythmic variety in flowing metaphors like "black mouth swallowing moonlight" propels momentum, and figurative language coheres without muddle, especially in the peak beat of vibrating water and dancing shadows.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghostly interaction through water-damaged sheet music transforms familiar haunted-setting tropes into a non-obvious exploration of silence as composition; risk in wordless, motion-based climax heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable from her inspiration by absences.</comment>
