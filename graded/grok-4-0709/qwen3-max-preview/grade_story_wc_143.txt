<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies through embodied emotions, like the "quiet ache" driving her vigil, with contradictory impulses shown in her bittersweet smile and final labeling act. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, as seen in "She carried the image in her chest now—not on film, but in marrow." Flaws complicate choices without hedging, and the earned stasis at closure forecloses paths with felt emotional cost. This elevates the score, meeting the 9+ test through simultaneous contradictions and causal earning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and cadence shifts, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration via charged poise in the final ascent, with conceptual cost legible in the "dawnlit melancholy" honoring persistence. Orientation anchors early with the inspector on the moonlit summit, and one meaningful deepening suffices for scope. The closure lands on-page with undeniable pressure, as in "She didn’t look back. There was no need." No orientation penalty applies, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The lunar setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "boots crunching softly over regolith" and "frost from its glass face" constraining choices and charging the final image of the glowing summit. Atmosphere evolves with dawn's light mirroring internal states, and spatial choreography tracks cleanly. The environment pressures the vigil, meeting the 9+ test by shaping the closure's resonant poise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of witnessing the end builds through density increase and cadence shift, with one meaningful deepening at the grain's fall forcing stance crystallization. Agency via endurance forecloses paths with felt emotional cost, as in the "throat tight" moment. Pressure coheres but lacks a second intensification for higher bands, though cost is unmistakable on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of outlasting through witness emerges organically from images like the falling grain and empty hourglass, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to human ingenuity's silence without moralizing. Subtext in implications like "a farewell sung to an empty auditorium" invites reflection on persistence. The final image reweights the premise with conceptual cost, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with controlled distance, perceptual signature biased toward curiosity in details like the "faintest shimmer within." Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, lyric syntax, as in the opening's crunching boots and fogging visor. No dialogue, so those bullets are ignored; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally in sentences like "The dawning hush settled as Sol’s first rays crested Mare Imbrium’s rim," advancing atmosphere without loops or artifacts. Information propels forward, free of redundancies, and figurative language is coherent without muddle in peak beats. Zero scaffolds or template cadence, meeting the 9+ test fully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes lunar sci-fi with elegiac witness in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming tropes through specific details like the chemical reactions in sand grains. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes organically, as in the harmonic resonance as unheard farewell. It feels inevitable in hindsight, with authenticity avoiding derivatives.</comment>
