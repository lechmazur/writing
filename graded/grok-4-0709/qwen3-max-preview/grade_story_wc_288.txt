<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Veyra's motivation to translate isolation into independence is clear and rooted in her traits as a reincarnated witness to extinction, intensifying through her actions like channeling resonance into the sundial during the flood. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in her burden of memory versus active resistance, culminating in an earned reconfiguration at the end. The reflection-led mode exceeds 30% but anchors to present stimuli like the hum and sundial, interleaving with micro-choices that alter options without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through resonant echoes and pattern shifts, with one meaningful deepening during the flood crisis that reweights the stake of coexistence. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing in the final image of the shadow shifting toward genesis, with undeniable conceptual cost in realigning extinction's burden to possibility. Orientation anchors who (Veyra), where (tidal library above clouds), and when (brittle awakenings) by ~50 words, serving the lyric payoff without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting of the tidal library above clouds is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like salt-crusted stone and vapor-sea hum filtering through Veyra's bias to constrain choices, such as securing the sundial during the flood. Atmosphere evolves causally with the tide's surge, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism, and the recurring sundial as micro-setting charges the final image of shifted shadows. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, with environmental pressures like sub-cloud quakes affecting the hum and alignment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resisting entropy through coexistence signals early and tightens once via the flood's coherent pressure, forcing Veyra's agency in channeling her resonance, which crystallizes her stance with felt cost in her soul's scar tissue. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, this deepening reweights the stake from mourning to midwifing futures without coincidence resolving it. Moral calculus sharpens the choice between preserving echoes and realigning them, with visible price in her trembling shadow alignment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of translating loss into sovereignty emerges organically from particulars like the sundial's crooked shadow and Veyra's atomic resonance, embracing complexity without tidy morals. Subtext operates in images of ghosts breathing beside her, inviting reflection through purposeful ambiguity in extinction's non-finality. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by repricing the library as a loom, eliciting an aftereffect of ozone-scented possibility without assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and apt for the lyric mode, with perceptual signature biased toward refractive memories and hum vibrations, modulating rhythm under pressure like the flood without head-hopping. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax and patterned elision, taught early and paid off at closure with purposeful compression. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; free indirect style is clean, with distance shifts serving emotional beats like the gold-flaring skin.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density and propulsion through rhythmic variation and multi-job sentences, with vivid images like "ghost-trumpets vibrated in her bones" advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated in peak beats like the flood, avoiding muddle or register drift. Read-aloud rhythm breathes naturally, with syntactic variety supporting emphasis; final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise of a tidal library etching echoes of extinction offers a fresh synthesis of memory and futurity, transformed through specific details like the woodpecker's coordinates and atomic skin. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to implications like realigning shadows toward chimeras. Originality shines in the non-obvious reconfiguration from mausoleum to loom, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
