<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to map emotions through borrowed personalities is clear and intensifies via her use of the halo fragment, with embodied contradictions in her erosion from empathy; however, secondary characters like the clockmaker feel anecdotal rather than crucibles for her growth, slightly diluting relational pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the mosaic structure builds through patterned shards with legible transitions, culminating in a Charged Poise closure as she walks into the dark with unsolved mathematics, carrying conceptual cost of perpetual erosion; orientation anchors early in the workshop, but some anecdotal shards risk minor lens ambiguity before the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The topaz workshop under vanishing stars is vividly sensory and purposeful, with refracting panels and starlight constraining her work's timing and charging the final glyph's glow; the micro-setting of the halo fragment as a tool directly shapes choices and the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake in mapping unmappable emotions tightens through accumulating borrowed personalities and halo uses, with a meaningful deepening in the final typesetting that reweights her isolation's cost; however, pressure remains more textural than escalating via agency-driven turns, with coincidence in pamphlet distribution complicating but not resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of empathy as non-Euclidean space emerges organically from her actions and the halo's effects, with resonant ambiguity in the final glyph inviting reflection without moralizing; the warlord's weeping offers a non-literal reconfiguration of mercy, though some abstract statements border on overtness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with a distinct lyrical texture in syntax and rhythm, perceptual bias filtering emotions through mathematical metaphors; purposeful compression and elision are taught early and pay off at closure, with no head-hopping or register drift under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, high information density in metaphors like "asymptote of longing," and no loops or artifacts; figurative language coheres without muddle, accelerating in the final sigh of stars, though one mixed metaphor in "inner weather" slightly strains but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes empathy with dimensional mathematics in a fresh, inevitable way, transforming cryptic artist tropes through the halo's evolving use and bold risk in accumulative structure that heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry; the warlord's rusting sword offers a non-obvious inflection on redemption.</comment>
