<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to break free from the city's amnesia is clear and intensifies through her empirical observations, culminating in the earned stasis of leaving the lantern as an anchor with the felt cost of carrying ancestral dread. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like the cold iron biting her palm revealing contradictory impulses of calm resolve amid sorrow. A key strength is the micro-choice to murmur "Show me," which forecloses denial and aligns with her hierarchy of values, though secondary characters are absent, fitting the single-POV scope without penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered whispers and images to a resonant reconfiguration in the final lantern pulse, syncing with her heartbeat for a charged poise that reweights her vulnerability with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors who (investigator), where (subway tunnel), and when (after drought) by the first 120 words, with no disorientation debt. The single meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the death's cause as a memory-field rupture, tightening the stake without needing multiple turns at this length; however, some reflective blocks slightly exceed BRR defaults but anchor in present cues like the lantern's glow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The subway maintenance tunnel is vividly anchored with sensory details like damp air, diesel residue, and dripping runoff, selectively filtered through the protagonist's watchful calm to mirror her internal entanglement with history. A strength is how the setting constrains choices, such as the reverberating walls summoning memories that charge the final image of the lantern as sentinel. The micro-setting of the lantern itself functions as an evolving tool that charges the closure, meeting the 9+ test by directly shaping her reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of acknowledging entangled memories escalates through a single meaningful deepening—the realization of the death's true cause—forcing stance crystallization with the felt cost of fortified vulnerability. Agency manifests in her renunciation of bureaucratic lies, foreclosing amnesia via the lantern placement, though coincidence in the memory surge complicates without resolving. The moral calculus between progress and remembrance sharpens the peak choice, but stakes remain somewhat abstract until the etched name on her forearm makes the personal price visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of entangled memories resisting amnesia emerges organically from images like the flickering lantern and reverberating whispers, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer via the pulsing glow that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in silences and implications, such as the boy's plea, invites reflection on progress's costs, avoiding sentimentality through concrete sorrow. The final image offers conceptual repricing of ignorance as a cage, meeting the 9+ test by reweighting prior material like her mother's warning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature in selective noticing of thermal anomalies and echo decay, modulating rhythm under pressure like the tightening throat at the end. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax and rhythm, teaching patterned elision early through fragmented whispers that pay off at closure. Minimal dialogue feels natural and subtextual, such as murmuring "Show me," advancing the arc without tags; no head-hopping or register drift, meeting the 9+ test with rhythmic control heightening the final pulse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like "doors left shut fester" to propel momentum without loops or scaffold, though occasional figurative stacking in peak beats like shadows as reaching fingers borders on muddle but remains coherent. Information advances atmosphere and character, with strong verbs and specific nouns replacing generics, passing the read-aloud test. No artifacts touch closure, and the final line resolves by recharging the lantern motif with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise of a death investigator uncovering ancestral echoes in urban infrastructure offers a fresh synthesis of historical trauma and modern bureaucracy, transformed through specific details like the 1852 shoeprint aligning with footprints. Risk-taking in blending empirical methods with supernatural memory-fields heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in the lantern's pulse. No close echoes of famous scenes, with authenticity in the singular vision of fortified vulnerability.</comment>
