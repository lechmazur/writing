<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to notice and resist creeping normality is clear and intensifies through embodied actions like placing bread and planting seeds, revealing internal contradictions in her gentle pace versus defiant gardening; emotions are embodied in her deeper breathing and soil-brushing, with flaws like patience as self-deception adding depth. The meaningful endurance earns stasis by foreclosing passive grief with felt cost in the lingering untouched bread. Interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing, as in the ghost of laughter felt through touch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of loss and renewal, with one meaningful deepening in the uncloaking and gardening that reweights stakes; orientation anchors early with the courtyard and barefoot walk by ~50 words. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing in the dripping water and unnamed star, making before/after legible with conceptual cost of remembered questioning. Waiver for subtle disorientation in overgrown setting pays off at closure, avoiding penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard anchors vividly with moss-muffled footsteps and vine-swallowed statues, constraining choices like kneeling by the fountain; sensory details like damp soil taste and rustling leaves reflect POV bias toward quiet rebellions. The tea house and fountain evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism, and the courtyard pressures the guerrilla gardening action. Recurring elements like the cracked fountain charge the final dripping water image, meeting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of seeking tenuous absolution signals early with the bread offering, tightening once through uncloaking and gardening that deepens via pattern break, reweighting grief with possibility under Textural lens; agency in renunciation forecloses forgetting with felt cost in untouched bread. Coherent pressure crystallizes stance in the smile, though coincidence of wind shift complicates without resolving. Moral calculus between loss and defiance sharpens the seed-planting choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of finding sacred in ordinary emerges organically from images like stale bread and wildflower seeds, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in untouched offerings; subtext in silence and gestures invites reflection on creeping normality. The final star image offers resonant, non-literal repricing of beauty's defiance without stating a moral, eliciting emotional aftereffect of quiet courage. Insights earn through specific struggles like shedding the shawl, avoiding platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature in selective noticing of rustles as whispers and ivy-absorbed laughter; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, gentle syntax modulating with emotional beats like trembling flame. No dialogue, so policy skips; purposeful compression in lyric mode teaches pattern early and pays off at closure with star blink. Distinct idiom avoids register drift, meeting 9+ test with rhythmic control under introspective pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, each sentence advancing atmosphere and character via vivid images like "crust hardened like old promises"; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops or template cadence, with syntactic variety in gentle pacing. No artifacts obscure closure, and figurative language like "patience is the grammar of absolution" coheres without muddle in peak moments. Opening anchors voice, final line resolves by recharging motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality in synthesizing creeping normality with guerrilla gardening offers fresh angle on loss and renewal, transforming tropes through specific details like wisteria-buried tea house; risk in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes organically. Core premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with non-obvious uncloaking turn arising from character. Avoids stock metaphors, committing to authentic vision without hedging.</comment>
