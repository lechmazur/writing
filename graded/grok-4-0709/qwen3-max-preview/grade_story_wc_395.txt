<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation evolves from curiosity to obsession with clear interior contradictions, embodied in her lies to herself and others, culminating in an earned stasis as the crew's anchor with the felt cost of isolation. Strengths include concrete micro-choices, like patching the emblem as a signal, which reveal values under pressure. The single-POV interiority is character-specific, avoiding stock phrasing, and her flaws complicate choices without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, with coherent pattern-building through recurring numbers and echoes leading to a resonant reconfiguration at 07:07, where shadows emerge and she accepts her role with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors early in the archive setting, and the single-shard structure fits defaults with one meaningful deepening via the restore trigger. Minor slip in ellipsis of janitor interaction slightly softens causality but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The social network archive is vividly specific, with server hums and frosted glass constraining choices and charging the final whispers in monitor flickers. Atmosphere of sensed absence builds through selective sensory details filtered by POV bias, mirroring her internal descent. The patch as recurring object charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering the crew's fate tightens through pattern accumulation, with agency in her restore action forcing stance crystallization under the textural lens, and cost legible in her ongoing lies and vigilance. One meaningful deepening via coordinates revelation narrows options, though secondary echoes feel slightly spread thin. Escalation drives protagonist choices with undeniable pressure at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of lingering deletions emerges organically from gaps and resonances, culminating in a resonant final image of the patch humming without stated moral, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. Subtext in silences and negative spaces invites ambiguity, earned through her struggles. Meets 9+ test by offering a non-literal answer that recharges prior motifs like forgotten songs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with distinct perceptual signature in rhythmic, lyric prose that modulates with obsession's intensity, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. No dialogue present, so ignored; diction and syntax reflect her archival mindset without register drift. Elision pays off in gaps motif, meeting 9+ test with rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, purposeful imagery like "ghost pixels in corrupted thumbnails," varying rhythm and syntax for propulsion without loops or artifacts. Information advances character and atmosphere in every line, with no figurative muddle even in peak beats. Meets 9+ test with zero scaffold and clear momentum to the humming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital haunting and corporate erasure transforms sci-fi tropes through specific details like temporal coordinates and resonance chamber, feeling inevitable with risk-taking in lyric structure that heightens thematic stakes.
