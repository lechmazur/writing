<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Arlen's motivation to foster interspecies respect is clear and intensifies through concrete actions like freeing the sparrow, revealing contradictory impulses of calm acceptance amid terminal decay; interiority is embodied in his unhurried reverence, with flaws like quiet isolation complicating choices without hedging; the final renunciation of fear earns stasis with visible cost in his gentle death, foreclosing frantic goodbyes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned shards of observation and growth, with one meaningful deepening at the diary's tying that reweights legacy; orientation anchors early in the orchard, and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost in the orchard's enduring harmony, though minor ellipsis in villager interactions slightly softens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The temple orchard is vividly specific, with living stone pillars and copper-wrapped branches constraining Arlen's remodeling choices and charging the final burial image under the Whisper Arch; sensory details like mist and rustling leaves filter through his biased perception, evolving causally to mirror his calm dissolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of building interspecies respect escalates texturally through accumulating collaborations like the sparrow incident, tightening to force stance crystallization at his death; one deepening forecloses isolation with felt cost in his fading pulse, though coincidence in animal behaviors slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of coexistence emerges organically from particulars like copper-guided growth, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in Arlen's quiet thrill amid decay; the final image of sparrows nesting reprices the premise non-literally, eliciting resonant reflection on respect as collaborative design without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual signature in Arlen's reverent noticing of mycelium and wind; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, purposeful syntax that modulates with dawn mists and auroras, teaching patterned elision paid off at closure; no dialogue, so policy skips those bullets.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like "He felt no urgency, no regret—only the quiet thrill," advancing atmosphere without loops; metaphors like vines threading fissures are coherent and purposeful, with zero artifacts obscuring the closure sigh lost in leaves.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of terminal illness with botanical architecture transforms familiar dying-man tropes through specific copper method and interspecies motif, feeling inevitable in the raccoons' investigation; risk in lyric accumulations heightens stakes without gimmickry, though premise echoes eco-fables slightly.</comment>
