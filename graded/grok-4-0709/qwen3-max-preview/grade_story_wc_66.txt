<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The copyist's motivation as a rebel against story famine is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in consistent traits like precision and belief in melody's power, culminating in her tearful broadcast as an earned endurance with felt emotional cost. Interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotions shown through actions like thumb-singeing and weeping that reveal contradictory impulses under pressure. No stock phrasing mars the portrayal, and her flaws, such as isolation, complicate choices without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increasing through patterned broadcasts and motifs, leading to a Charged Poise closure where her dawn transmission reconfigures options with conceptual cost of vulnerability. Orientation anchors who (copyist), where (alcove), and when (post-famine nights) by ~50 words, with no disorientation debt. Structure fits Track B mosaic with legible shard transitions via time cues, building one meaningful deepening at the personal lyric that forces her stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The ember alcove and mist are vividly specific, with sensory details like ink-stained fingers and pulsing warmth filtered through POV bias, constraining choices like midnight tuning and charging the final image of waiting calm. Atmosphere evolves causally, mirroring internal resurrection through flaring embers and dust theaters, while micro-setting of the radio enables key actions without static repetition. No clichés or inconsistencies dilute the lived-in navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><grade>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, dominant stake of reviving stories tightens meaningfully when the broadcast targets her, deepening pressure via tears as catalyst, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in mourning. Agency shines in her renunciation of silence through broadcasting, foreclosing isolation with visible emotional price that alters tactics. No coincidental resolutions; coincidence in signals complicates but protagonist drives escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of art's resurrection emerges organically from images like dust motes whispering tales, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in metaphors like moon boots and inkwell dreams invites reflection on loss and memory, with purposeful ambiguity in the broadcasts' origins enriching complexity. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars like tear-blurred staves, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with controlled distance, perceptual signature biased toward tactile warmth and melodic whispers, and rhythmic prose modulating with intensity like thudding heart. Patterned elision in lyric mode is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; voice texture is distinct and purposeful, with non-standard punctuation serving effect legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in sentences like "Static hissed, then a voice, frayed but fierce," advancing atmosphere and character without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, heightening peaks without muddle, as in dust coalescing into whispers. Zero scaffold, high information density, and clean mechanics ensure clarity, with final line recharging motifs indelibly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic story famine with pirate radio and orchestral resurrection feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like moth-wing cloth and tear-catalyzed dust. Bold risk in lyric mosaic heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise's implications like broadcasts as carrier pigeons. No derivative echoes; freshness arises from non-obvious angle on memory and rebellion.</comment>
