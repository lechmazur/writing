<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in her traits of patience and grit, with embodied emotions like rattling molars under stress revealing character under pressure; internal conflict shows through her cautious hope amid chaos, earning the endurance at closure with felt cost of ongoing vigilance. Secondary elements like relationships are absent, fitting single-POV scope without penalty. The line "She wouldn’t let it happen here" anchors her hierarchy of values effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Structure fits Accumulative/Textural lens with patterned signal buildup and cadence shift at dawn, landing a Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis as the signal retreats with conceptual cost of eternal watchfulness; orientation anchors early in the booth, and one meaningful deepening through the counter-frequency test suffices. Closure is on-page with the final whisper reweighting options, though backstory shard on Tau Ceti briefly risks orientation without payoff harm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting in the university radio station is vivid and purposeful, with dim glow and corkboard walls constraining choices like jury-rigging the generator; sensory details like vibrating molars and humming capacitors integrate into action, mirroring internal hope. The charts as recurring object charge the final image by pinning a new one, elevating specificity. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly in the booth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><grade>Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens with one meaningful deepening via the test pulse, narrowing options as the signal tightens with irritation; dominant stake of outwitting tricksters escalates to stance crystallization at dawn, with felt cost in community breathing but not healing. Agency through interference forecloses passive reception with visible price in her isolation. The freshman post exemplifies the tightening's impact.</grade>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of hope as a counter to cosmic corrosion emerges organically from images like tuning a poisoned violin to lullabies, inviting reflection on psychological warfare without tidy morals; subtext in the signal's irritation adds complexity. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer by repricing signals as games she can win, though some abstraction in "ethereal grit" borders on statement. Emotional aftereffect lingers via her whisper to the static.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in signal vibrations and chart-tracing, modulating rhythm under pressure like shortened sentences during patching; prose texture uses purposeful compression in reflections, taught early. Dialogue is minimal but natural in the freshman post, advancing plot subtextually. No head-hopping, and elision in reports pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in beats like the pulsing signal description; metaphors like peeling skin from an apple propel without muddle, and no loops or artifacts obscure closure. Sentence propulsion accelerates at 2:17 a.m. patching, with strong verbs advancing atmosphere. Minor scaffold in repetitive "signal" phrasing deducts slightly but doesn't touch peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing cosmic tricksters with subsonic psychological warfare, transforming sci-fi tropes through Elira's ethereal grit and frequency-based outwitting; fresh inflection in turning lies to lullabies feels inevitable. Risk in quiet, vigilant closure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on discord, coherent as singular vision.</comment>
