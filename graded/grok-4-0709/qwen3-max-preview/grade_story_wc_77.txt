<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to confront fear is clear and intensifies through embodied, contradictory impulses, such as clawing at memories while trembling, culminating in an earned renunciation with visible emotional cost. The whispering advisor applies secondary pressure effectively, forcing choices that alter the protagonist's state. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, though some surreal elements border on abstraction without fully degrading perception under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increases and pattern breaks building to a Conceptual Repricing closure where fear dissolves into recognition, with undeniable conceptual cost in the final image. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first paragraph, waiving any penalty. Single continuous scene fits scope, with one meaningful deepening sufficient; the unbosoming beat provides a resonant reconfiguration without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The abandoned funhouse setting is vivid and purposeful, with cracked mirrors and breathing walls constraining choices and charging the final image of dawn through the ticket booth. Sensory details are selective, reflecting POV bias under urgency, and evolve causally, mirroring internal dread. Environment pressures action tactilely, such as the snapping floorboard, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><grade>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of tricking fear escalates through density increases like the Hall of Whispers and dictionary reading, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in extracted memories. One meaningful deepening is sufficient, driven by protagonist agency, though coincidence in the advisor's guidance slightly complicates without resolving. Moral calculus sharpens the climax, but secondary stakes feel optional and under-braided.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fear as a self-fed reflection emerges organically from images like glowing memories and dissolving replica, offering a resonant, non-literal answer in the final awakening without moralizing. Subtext in gestures and implications, such as the advisor's spectral hand, invites reflection through ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect is concrete, avoiding sentimentality, with the core concept integrated via specific events.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in surreal, biased noticing, like vibrations making molars ache; rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscurity. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances plot, distinguishing voices through the advisor's whispers inside the skull. Patterned elision in lyric mode is taught early and paid off at closure; no head-hopping or register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, high information density, and purposeful figurative language like "letters melting like candle wax" that enhances without muddle in peak beats. Zero loops or scaffolds; sentences advance atmosphere and character, though some stacked metaphors in the unbosoming slightly risk overwriting without harming clarity. Opening anchors voice, final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of funhouse horror and psychological confrontation feels inevitable, transforming tropes like mirrors reflecting dread through specific, non-obvious details like the opera cloak clasp pulsing with fear. Bold risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to the premise's implications. Fresh inflection in the advisor's paradoxical notes elevates ingenuity, avoiding derivative echoes.</comment>
