<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira's motivation to resurrect ruin through functional creativity is clear and intensifies via concrete actions like rerouting steam, revealing character through embodied choices under pressure. Interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions embodied in her stoic wonder, though some abstract questions border on unearned epiphany. The final renunciation of perfect restoration earns stasis with visible cost in ongoing cracks, foreclosing brute-force paths. Relationships are absent, so no penalty there.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern of redirection building to CR closure via the hope equation, reweighting decay into resilience with conceptual cost in adaptation's limits. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by 120 words, with deliberate mosaic shards taught early and transitions legible. One meaningful deepening suffices, as steam redirection tightens the drive toward communal revival. Minor ellipsis in visitor arrivals feels motivated but could tighter link to causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting anchors early with vivid, purposeful details like cracked glass and geothermal lines that constrain and enable choices, such as cannibalizing conduits for redirection. Atmosphere of stoic wonder builds through sensory hierarchy filtered by Elira's engineering bias, with environment evolving causally to charge the final pulsing image. Micro-setting of the sextant and steam directly shapes tactics and closure. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, mirroring internal adaptation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of puzzling hope through redirection signals early and deepens once via steam repurposing, narrowing options from sealing to flow under Accumulative lens, with felt cost in entropy's persistence. Agency in endurance forecloses neglect, but pressure feels situational and low-intensity without sharp reversal or ethical calculus. Coincidence of thermal flicker complicates without resolving. Stakes remain somewhat abstract, lacking visceral test in a concrete loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of hope as redirected flow emerges organically from particulars like steam and light fractals, culminating in non-literal CR via the equation that reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in silence, graffiti, and visitor murmurs invites ambiguity on revival's cost, eliciting resonant aftereffect of quiet resilience. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality through flawed adaptation. Core concept integrates tightly, resisting tidy binaries with counter-readings in persistent cracks.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with controlled distance, perceptual signature biased toward structural angles and equations, modulating rhythm under wonder without head-hopping. Prose texture distinct in poetic syntax and compression, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. No dialogue, so no evaluation there. Elision of time jumps pays off in accumulative buildup, with diction consistent to Elira's functional mindset.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with sentences advancing atmosphere and character via vivid images like "breath returned to a corpse," propulsion rhythmic without loops or scaffold. Figurative language dense but coherent, avoiding muddle in peak beats like steam redirection. Minor overwriting in abstract questions, but syntax varies purposefully for momentum. Zero artifacts touch closure, with strong verbs and specificity enhancing clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of engineering poetry and sci-fi decay transforms renewal trope through specific choices like sextant-measured shadows and kinetic tiles, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk in lyric mosaic heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise of adaptation over restoration. Emotional specificity avoids generics, with non-obvious angle on hope via equations. No close echoes of famous works, coherence as singular vision.</comment>
