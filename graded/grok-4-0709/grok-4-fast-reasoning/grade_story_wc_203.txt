<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to uncover hidden truths is clear and drives his actions, rooted in his ghost-seeing trait and observational skills, leading to an earned endurance in confronting the past; however, internal conflicts feel summarized rather than embodied in contradictory impulses during key moments like prying the panel, and the ghosts lack pressure as crucibles for his choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through observational shards with a resonant reconfiguration at the end via the ghosts' release, but embedded revision notes like "Wait, that's over—adjusting for count" disrupt causality and orientation, failing to teach a deliberate pattern and leaving anchors unclear past the midpoint without payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is vividly anchored with sensory details like dust motes and warped counters that filter through Elias's observant POV, subtly mirroring his internal quest; the ceiling and dust patterns constrain choices, charging the final image of release, though minor inconsistencies in spatial choreography during the prying moment slightly dilute immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake of discovering hidden burdens escalates through a meaningful deepening in analyzing dust and engaging ghosts, forcing a stance crystallization under the Accumulative lens with felt conceptual cost in the ghosts' fading; however, the revision notes introduce coincidental resets that undermine pressure coherence without complicating agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of concealed regrets and facades emerges organically from dust patterns and ledgers, culminating in a resonant non-literal repricing of burdens in the final image without moralizing; subtext in ghostly eyes and weightless forms invites reflection on unspoken costs, though the overt "cracks in the façade" echo trends toward mid-band explicitness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person is stable with perceptual bias in Elias's upward gaze and dust analysis, modulating rhythm under pressure like the whirring discovery; prose texture is distinct in syntactic flow, but embedded notes cause unmotivated slippage into meta-voice, obscuring focalization without taught pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Prose suffers from pervasive artifacts like paraphrase loops in revision notes ("No, recount properly. Actually...") and template cadence in count adjustments, obscuring momentum and clarity at closure; information density is inconsistent, with redundant stems dulling propulsion, though some images like dust motes dancing offer selective vividness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of ghost-seeing technician and circus relics offers a fresh angle on hidden histories, transforming tropes through specific observational methods like dust analysis; however, the premise echoes familiar supernatural discovery arcs without bold risk-taking, and revision artifacts hedge ingenuity.</comment>
