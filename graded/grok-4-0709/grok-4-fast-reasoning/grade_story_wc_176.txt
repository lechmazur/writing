<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve forgotten names after self-forgiveness is clear and intensifies through her actions, rooted in her artisan traits with embodied emotions like trembling fingers and sweat despite cold; interior contradiction shows in her thawed heart versus the icy setting, earning the final endurance with felt emotional cost. Strengths include character-specific micro-choices, like technically gentle rope reconfiguration, revealing values. Minor weakness in somewhat stock artisan archetype without bolder flaws complicating choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through descriptive shards in one continuous sanctum scene with oriented anchors by 120 words; causality accumulates via motif patterns like thawing and echoes, leading to Resonant Reconfiguration closure where hearing names reweights her redemption with visible tears and mended heart as felt cost. One meaningful deepening suffices, with persistent aurora constraint shaping tactics. Orientation is strong, but ellipsis in backstory integration slightly softens linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum under aurora is vividly anchored early with sensory details like fogging breath and dripping ice, filtered through Elara's POV; environmental elements constrain choices, like the altar and rope enabling reconfiguration, and charge the final image with receding ice mirroring her warmth. Micro-setting of the rope and card as tools evolves causally, supporting tone without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving names signals early, tightening through reconfiguration under Accumulative/Textural lens via density increase in auroral light and whispers, forcing stance crystallization with felt emotional cost in tears; agency in her decisions forecloses silence with trade-off of past guilt. One deepening is sufficient, but coincidence of aurora intensification slightly complicates without fully resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of redemption through preservation emerges organically from images like thawing frost and audible names, culminating in resonant final image that reweights forgiveness without moralizing; subtext in gestures like gentle touch invites reflection on loss. Emotional aftereffect is concrete via tears, embracing complexity without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature in Elara's artisan-biased noticing of fibers and perforations; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, motif-laden syntax that modulates with intensity. No dialogue, so ignore those bullets; some elision in emotional peaks is taught and paid off at closure. Minor register drift into elevated diction occasionally jars immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purposeful rhythm and vivid images, advancing atmosphere through multi-job sentences, but overwriting in stacked metaphors like "snowmelt ardor" and synonym loops (e.g., thawing repetitions) creates minor scaffold drag without obscuring closure. Clarity is strong with varied syntax, though some figurative muddle in peak beats slightly dulls propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lost wax casting with punched card and rope reconfiguration transforms fantasy tropes through specific artisan details and emotional complexity; risk in lyric density heightens preservation stakes organically. Core premise feels inevitable in hindsight without close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
