<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to transform scars is clear and intensifies through embodied stress like crystals in veins, compelling micro-choices such as dipping the quill in tears; interior conflict shows contradictory impulses in revisiting superstitions amid scholarly doubt, earning the final endurance with felt cost of reliving pain. The elder's presence applies subtle pressure, forcing relational nuance in the ritual. Strengths in character-specific embodiment outweigh minor stock phrasing in emotional labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned reflection and imagery to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the glowing parchment reweights scars into stories with undeniable emotional cost, visible in dissolving crystals; orientation anchors early in the platform's hush, with one continuous scene fitting scope. Persistent constraint of stress-induced crystals shapes tactics, paying off in the final image. Minor deduction for some reflective density that borders on flattening causality without breaking the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting of the floating rock platform is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices like etching runes amid thermals and charging the final glowing parchment image; sensory details like steam-warmed stone and distant thunder reflect POV urgency and mirror internal storms. Micro-setting of the quill and parchment integrates into action, evolving causally. Environment meaningfully shapes the rite's tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of shedding burdens tightens through deepening inscription beats, forcing stance crystallization under textural lens with felt cost in warming crystals; agency in revisiting superstitions forecloses unhealed paths, reweighting options at closure. One meaningful deepening suffices, with pressure coherent despite reflective mode. Minor slip in abstract stakes not always viscerally tested on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of transforming pain into resilience emerges organically from particulars like crow quill and runes, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights scars without moralizing; subtext in gestures like the elder's nod invites ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect lingers through earned insight from struggle. Avoids sentimentality, embracing complexity in superstition's role.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in rune-focused noticing, modulating rhythm under stress like prickling crystals; prose texture in syntax and diction reflects Elara's scholarly yet superstitious mind. Minimal dialogue is natural and subtextual in the elder's silent understanding. No head-hopping or elision issues, with purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm and high information load, advancing atmosphere through images like etched runes without loops; figurative language like "crystals prickling under her skin" is coherent and payoff-driven in peak beats. Minor overwriting in descriptive stacks slightly dulls momentum but doesn't obscure closure. Clarity and concision strong overall, passing read-aloud test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy elements like floating platform and stress crystals feels organic and inevitable, transforming trope of healing scars through specific rune-scholar angle; risk in lyric reflection heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generics, with non-obvious reconfiguration at end. Minor hedging in familiar orphan backstory slightly limits boldness.</comment>
