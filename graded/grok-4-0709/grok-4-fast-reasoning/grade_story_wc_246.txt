<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to redeem past regrets is clear and intensifies through her isolation, compelling the high-stakes edit; interiority is concrete with embodied emotions like heart thrumming amid ambiguity, revealing contradictory impulses in her "confidently uncertain" state. The meaningful change—editing history to reconnect with her brother—feels earned by prior causality, foreclosing alienation with a felt cost of fragility symbolized by the bending nib. No other on-page characters, so relationship bullets are ignored; flaws like doubt complicate choices without safety-hedging, though some emotional progression borders on tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Inferred Hybrid lens (Causal dominant at closure) holds with because/therefore linkages from finding the pen to editing history, culminating in a Decisive Change where visions and unburdening reconfigure her stance with felt cost of meddled time's indifference. Orientation anchors who (Elara), where (Epsilon Drift station), and when (drift-cycle post-mistake) by ~120 words, waiving any penalty. Single continuous scene fits defaults; one meaningful tightening suffices, but some elliptical causality in the anomaly's response feels under-motivated, slightly weakening closure cost legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices like objects drifting and providing quantum flux for ink, directly charging the final image of the station as cradle. Sensory details are selective, reflecting Elara's urgency with humming artifacts and flickering lights mirroring her ambiguity. Micro-setting of the pen and console integrates into action, evolving causally with events; spatial choreography tracks cleanly in weightless isolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of threshing meaning from regrets signals early and tightens once through the editing act, narrowing options via contingent threads and forcing a trade-off with time's fragility under Hybrid lens (Causal dominant). Agency in unbending the nib and inscribing shifts drives escalation, with visible cost in the nib's reminder of fragility charging the final image. Pressure coheres but lacks a sharper on-page reversal; coincidence of finding the pen complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of mutable history and redemption emerges organically from Elara's editing act and visions, resisting tidy morals through ambiguity in the anomaly's indifference and fragile nib. Subtext in the pen's hum and gravity's tug implies deeper cosmic contingency without direct statements. Final image of unburdened cradle offers resonant, non-literal repricing of regrets as harvestable, reweighting prior material; emotional aftereffect lingers via purposeful complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV third-person close with controlled focalization, perceptual signature biased toward cosmic signals and regrets, modulating rhythm with emotional intensity like thrumming heart. Prose texture distinct in metaphorical syntax, purposeful without head-hopping; no dialogue, so ignore those bullets. Elision of edit mechanics is taught and paid off at closure; minor register drift into elevated diction fits sci-fi voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose advances with high density in metaphors like "minutes stretch or snap like brittle bones," varying rhythm and syntax for propulsion, though some paraphrase loops (e.g., repeating regret tangles) dull momentum slightly without touching closure. Figurative language is coherent but dense in peak beats, risking muddle; clarity holds with strong verbs and specific nouns. No major artifacts obscure cause/effect; final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Core premise of anomaly-enabled history editing offers fresh synthesis of sci-fi isolation and redemption, transforming trope of time meddling through contingent relationships and confidently uncertain trait. Emotional specificity in Elara's ambiguity avoids generics, with bold risk in metaphorical density heightening stakes organically. Turns feel earned from established anomaly rules; no close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
