<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Hiroshi's motivation to appreciate hidden patterns is clear and rooted in his traits as a net-mender philosopher, intensifying through embodied actions like tracing knots and whistling; interiority is concrete with contradictory impulses in his demure audacity, though the single-POV limits relational crucibles. Emotions are embodied in his quiet grace and faint smile at dawn, revealing values with felt cost in ongoing pursuit. The final renunciation of somber night affirms Earned Stasis with visible resilience cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increasing via firefly patterns and net mends, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing at the riverbank where hidden efforts reweight beauty with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors who (Hiroshi), where (parapet to river), and when (firefly season post-rain) by ~50 words, waiving any penalty. Single continuous shard with one transition fits defaults; closure lands on-page with felt affirmation, though causality is more textural than motivated ellipsis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like mossy edges and fractured moon reflections filter through Hiroshi's POV, constraining choices like descending via moon paths; the parapet as micro-setting charges the final ascent with resonant contrast. Atmosphere of scintillatingly somber night evolves causally with dawn, mirroring internal revelation. Environment guides action tactilely, with rain-slicked stones affecting descent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of appreciating hidden effort signals early but escalates texturally through pattern density in net and fireflies, with one meaningful deepening at the riverbank forcing stance crystallization; however, pressure remains low without narrowing options or visible trade-offs. Agency is internal endurance with oblique conceptual cost in ongoing audacity. Coherent under Accumulative lens, but lacks a tightening that forecloses paths palpably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of cherishing unseen labors emerges organically from net mends and tea whisk, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in firefly tears and knot victories invites ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding sentimentality. The core concept integrates via specific events like whistling to converge lights.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with distinct perceptual signature in philosophical noticing of patterns; prose texture via rhythmic syntax and purposeful compression heightens meditation without head-hopping. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; focalization controlled, with distance shifting intentionally for emotional beats like the whistle. Patterned diction teaches lyric mode early, paying off at closure with legible reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose advances atmosphere through dense, purposeful imagery like "tears sparkling on a mourner's cheek," with varied rhythm and high information density; however, occasional overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., sky bruised, lights scintillatingly somber) muddles peak beats without payoff. No major loops or artifacts, but figurative muddle in the descent slightly dulls propulsion. Clarity and concision strong overall, with final line recharging motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of net-mending philosophy with firefly meditation transforms tropes through specific details like bamboo whisk as harmony symbol; demure audacity offers non-obvious angle on resilience. Risk in lyric structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Core premise commits fully, avoiding generic abstractions.</comment>
