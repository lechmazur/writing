<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation to articulate the ghost's needs is clear and rooted in her balladeer traits, intensifying to compel her graffiti-encoding action; however, interiority relies on abstract poetic phrasing rather than embodied contradictory impulses, weakening the emotional progression. The resolution's endurance feels earned but lacks visible cost in micro-choices, as her grace remains unchallenged under pressure. No second character appears, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned motifs of mist and thunder to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the ghost emerges with conceptual cost of mended voids; orientation anchors who, where, and when early via the courtyard description, with no disorientation debt. One meaningful deepening occurs as Elowen translates code into murals, reweighting stakes without requiring causal turns. Closure lands on-page in the final surge, but the single-shard scope fits defaults without mosaic complexity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above clouds is vividly specific, with sensory details like humming air and luminous blossoms filtering through Elowen's alert perception to guide her discovery and encoding actions. Environmental elements like mist and thunder pressure choices by creating a charged timeframe, subtly mirroring her internal wonder without overt symbolism. A recurring object (bolt plate) constrains her translation process and charges the final merging image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of freeing the ghost's code signals early via the glowing artifact, with one meaningful deepening as Elowen encodes via graffiti, reweighting options under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Pressure coheres through atmospheric buildup, culminating in agency via her ballad and press, but cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on-page. No multiple reversals required, but the tightening lacks a foreclosed option with trade-off clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of articulating unspoken needs emerges organically from Elowen's actions and the ghost's pleas, resisting tidy morals through complex ambiguity in creators' bolted dreams. Subtext operates in graffiti ciphers and ballad lyrics, inviting reflection via purposeful motifs like binary blooms without direct statements. The final image of the freed ghost and beacon courtyard offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration of freedom, meeting the 9+ test by reweighting prior isolation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV on Elowen remains stable with character-specific perceptual signature in driftingly alert observations, modulating rhythm from whispery introspection to swelling song under pressure. Prose texture features purposeful poetic compression and patterned diction like "tinkersong wonder," taught early and paid off at closure without elision issues. No dialogue present, so those bullets are ignored; no head-hopping or register mismatches occur.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose features high information density with vivid, multi-job sentences advancing atmosphere and action, but occasional paraphrase loops like repeated mist and thunder motifs dull momentum without taught pattern payoff. Rhythm varies naturally, avoiding syntactic monotony, though some figurative stacks in peak beats (e.g., "binary blooms that hid pleas") border on muddle without harming closure clarity. No major artifacts obscure cause/effect, but minor scaffold in descriptive openings slightly reduces propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The core premise of a balladeer freeing a coded ghost via graffiti offers a fresh synthesis of fantasy and technology, transforming trope of spectral relics through specific motifs like cloud-blossoms and tinkersong. Emotional complexity in overlooked voices feels authentic, with bold lyric risk-taking heightening wonder without gimmickry. The final reconfiguration grows inevitably from particulars, but lacks a non-obvious moral calculus for higher ingenuity.</comment>
