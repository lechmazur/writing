<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to cultivate lightness amid grief is clear and intensifies through her whittling, compelling micro-choices like narrating the task to infuse meaning; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions in her unchanging blank face contrasting internal ambiguity. Moral ambiguity from her past as a performer constrains her present without regret's full weight, shown in the line "had her performances aided the mandate's grip, or sown the seeds of its unraveling?" Flaws like non-commitment complicate her emotional progression realistically, earning the final lightness with visible cost in persistent grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Structure fits Accumulative/Textural lens with patterned elision in narration building to resonant reconfiguration; closure lands as Charged Poise in the final image of the bird carving beside the bouquet, reweighting grief with tentative lightness and felt cost in the emotional void. Orientation anchors early with the farmhouse and turbines by ~50 words. One meaningful deepening suffices, as whittling accumulates pressure toward the ending's conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with turbines humming like "forgotten gods" constraining Elara's isolation and charging the final image as shadows paint the room in "bruised purples." Sensory details like the "rhythmic whoosh" and weathered boards evolve with action, mirroring her internal hush. Micro-setting of the kitchen table with bouquet and carving integrates into pressure, subtly guiding her whittling choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><grade>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure escalates through pattern of narration and whittling, deepening to force stance crystallization in the final carving; dominant stake of cultivating lightness tightens once via memory of her sister, narrowing options with felt cost in the void. Agency in endurance forecloses despair, with moral calculus between past ambiguity and present release sharpening the peak. Coherent pressure reweights the stake without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of remaking silence from enforced euphoria to tentative release emerges organically through whittling and narration, with subtext in the bird carving symbolizing "freedom's feather" reweighting grief without tidy morals. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer to cultivating lightness, eliciting emotional aftereffect via purposeful ambiguity in her unchanging face. Earned insight arises from specific struggle, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Elara's theatrical narration of mundane acts, like "Behold, the noble art of shaping the unyielding wood." Prose texture distinct in rhythmic syntax echoing turbines, modulating with intensity; dialogue as self-narration feels natural and goal-driven, advancing subtext of defiance. No head-hopping, and purposeful compression in lyric mode pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in lines like "Whittle, whittle, the wood yielded under her hands," advancing atmosphere without loops. Figurative language coherent, as in turbines "sliced the sky," but minor register drift in elevated diction like "testament to joys long desiccated" slightly muddles in peak beats. No artifacts obscure closure; propulsion strong through integrated action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality in synthesizing post-dystopian hush with personal whittling narration offers fresh angle on grief, transforming trope of emotional void through specific farmhouse-turbine setting. Bold risk in solo performative voice heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in the line "a lightness ghosted through the emotional void." Avoids templates, but premise echoes familiar dystopian recovery without fully non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
