<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation to preserve forgotten names is clear and intensifies through her actions, with embodied regret shown in her chest blooming "foxglove-sharp," revealing character under pressure. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, though internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in key moments like the mending. The final endurance feels earned with visible cost in deepened regret, foreclosing full victory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase through layered images leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in Earned Stasis, where Elowen persists amid regret, with felt cost in the "weight of loss pressed like clouds below." Orientation anchors who (Elowen), where (opal library above clouds), and when (timeless present) by ~50 words, serving the lyric mode. Single continuous scene fits scope, but lacks a sharper cadence shift at closure for higher impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The opal library above clouds is vividly specific, with sensory details like mist curling and prisms casting light, filtered through Elowen's caretaker bias; it constrains choices, as the ethereal air requires her precise touch for orchids. Environmental elements evolve causally, like the skylight piercing clouds aiding the mending, and charge the final image of shimmering orchids with borrowed light. Micro-setting of the workbench integrates action seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving against oblivion tightens through the mending beat, deepening via the song's echo and lighting, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in lingering regret; under Accumulative lens, pattern break in the chime's hum reweights the stake. Agency in her decision to mend forecloses oblivion for one item but highlights unavoidable loss. Coherent pressure builds without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of defiant preservation amid inevitable loss emerges organically from images like wilting orchids and fading runes, with subtext in the chime's hum carrying "extinct feelings" without direct statements. The final image of the chiming tube as a "fragile victory" offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration of the central question, embracing complexity. Avoids moralizing, eliciting emotional aftereffect through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with distinct perceptual signature in selective noticing of hues and echoes, biased by her guardian role; prose texture in rhythmic, flowing syntax reflects her gently systematic mind. No dialogue, but purposeful compression in lyric mode is taught early and pays off at closure without elision issues. Psychic distance shifts intentionally with emotional intensity, like closing eyes for the song.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with vivid, purposeful figurative language like "veins of captured light" advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the mending beat. No artifacts obscure closure, though dense metaphors in peak moments risk muddle but cohere via pattern. Opening anchors voice; final line recharges motifs with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fantasy elements like glass orchids and extinct feelings museum feels inevitable, transforming preservation tropes through specific, poetic details and bold lyric structure that heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh angle on loss via sonic names avoids generics, with risk in abstract timeframe paying off in resonant closure. No derivative echoes; authenticity coheres as singular vision.</comment>
