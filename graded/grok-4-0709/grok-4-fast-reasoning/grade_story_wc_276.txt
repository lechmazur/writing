<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation from childhood trauma is clear and intensifies to compel his calm pursuit amid chaos, with embodied resolve shining in the casting moment; interiority is concrete through actions like whispering to the spike, though contradictory impulses are subtle rather than simultaneous in scene, limiting to hairline slip from perfection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned imagery with coherent orientation by the garden's description; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands on-page with felt cost of mended fractures, shaped by persistent echo-wood rod constraint, satisfying 9+ test without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The sound wave garden anchors vividly early, constraining choices like dodging feral sounds and using silence-vines, charging the final image of lapping waves; sensory details like vibrating bass are purposeful and POV-filtered, meeting 9+ test by directly shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of catching the goddess's echo signals early and deepens through the zigzag cast, forcing stance crystallization under Situational/Accumulative hybrid lens with unmistakable cost in the haul's eternity-weight; agency in measured breaths drives escalation, though no secondary accent slightly tempers band entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of transliterating grief into harmony emerges organically from images like shattering petals and the feral lullaby, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in silence-voicing invites reflection on loss, satisfying 9+ test via non-literal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in sonic chaos, rhythmic control accelerating in the reel without elision issues; prose texture modulates with pressure, like blue light pulses, meeting 9+ test through consistent, voice-motivated lyric compression that pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with varied rhythm and purposeful metaphors like ink-bleeding constellations, advancing atmosphere without loops; some stacked figuratives in peak beats risk muddle but are pattern-taught and propel to closure, with zero artifacts touching the final image for strong control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of sonic garden and goddess echo feels inevitable through specific grief-motivated tactics, transforming fishing trope with bold risk in textural causality that heightens stakes; non-obvious feral lullaby tone charges closure without gimmickry, earning 9+ via irreplaceable ingenuity.</comment>
