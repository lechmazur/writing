<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's analytically intuitive trait drives concrete micro-choices, like tracing the tapestry to reveal patterns, with embodied emotion in her volcanic tenderness and callused fingers showing survival costs. Motivation intensifies credibly from arson backstory to claiming the codex, earning a resonant endurance with felt isolation as cost. Minor weakness in repetitive emotional labels like "heart burned" trending toward stock phrasing, but interior contradiction emerges in her analytical leaps amid intuitive whispers without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with patterned elision of discoveries building to a Conceptual Repricing closure where claiming the codex reweights her arson as echo of Lirael's passion, with felt cost in tears and vow. Orientation anchors early in the sunken archive, but deliberate disorientation in labyrinth pays off at core without waiver needed. One meaningful deepening suffices, though causality feels slightly elliptical in intuitive leaps, avoiding major breaks but capping high-band entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like ancient dust and volcanic minerals anchor the lost archive, constraining Elara's navigation and charging the final glowing crystals with inner fire. Micro-setting of artifacts like the tapestry and pedestal subtly mirrors her internal isolation, evolving causally without static repetition. Strength in POV-filtered specificity, but minor overreliance on visual motifs slightly limits sensory balance in peak moments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rescuing the forgotten promise tightens once through the trail's deepening, forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative lens with felt cost in her tears and protective vow. Agency in analytical tracing and intuitive following drives escalation, though coincidence in alignments complicates without resolving. Weakness in abstract stakes remaining somewhat viscerally distant, with one reversal sufficient but not fully narrowing options to force a sharper trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of rebirth through fire and forgotten promises emerges organically from Elara's arson echoing Lirael's vow, with resonant ambiguity in the codex's eternal renewal reweighting her isolation without tidy morals. Subtext in vandalized portrait and mosaic implies betrayal's cost, inviting reflection via purposeful complexity. Strength in final image offering non-literal answer, but minor thematic echo in overt "volcanic tenderness" verges on statement, slightly reducing emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with clean free indirect style filters perceptions through Elara's biased noticing, like glyphs humming with vows, maintaining modest certainty without leakage. Prose texture distinct in rhythmic, motif-laden syntax that modulates with discovery's intensity, teaching patterned elision early. No dialogue, so ignore those bullets; perceptual signature strong, but minor register drift in elevated diction like "cataclysm of ash and love" briefly jars under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density high with sentences advancing atmosphere and discovery, like tracing the tapestry revealing doors, but paraphrase loops in repetitive "volcanic tenderness" and synonym churn around "promise" dull momentum in peak beats. Rhythm varies naturally, though template cadence in analytical-intuitive pairings triggers minor artifact penalty without obscuring closure. Bracketed word-count notes ignored as generator tokens per screen, but overwriting in stacked metaphors like "lava, warm and insistent" muddles clarity slightly in the descent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arsonist seeker in a sunken archive transforms trope of lost knowledge through specific volcanic tenderness motif, feeling inevitable with risk in elliptical structure heightening thematic stakes. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on historical erasure via artistic trail, cohering as singular vision. Minor derivative echo in guardian's vow resembling stock fantasy relics, but grounded choices in Elara's off-grid survival personalize without hedging.</comment>
