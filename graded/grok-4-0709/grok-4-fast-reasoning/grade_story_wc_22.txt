<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to reclaim the battlefield burns quiet and fierce, rooted in consistent traits like speaking dead languages, compelling the higher-stakes choice to fertilize amid desolation; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses of regret and resilience layering realistically; the meaningful endurance forecloses despair with felt cost in his methodical work against salted soil; single-POV focus excels without needing relationship dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase via layered imagery building to resonant reconfiguration in the sprouts' emergence, reweighting desolation to promise with conceptual cost of past battles; orientation anchors early in the coastal road and twilight; single continuous scene fits scope with one meaningful deepening through bird-guided fertilization; closure lands on-page with charged poise in the harmony's resurfacing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight is vividly specific, with bruised purples and groaning planks mirroring Elias's resilient intent; sensory details like crunching shells and cool sea breath are purposeful, narrowing perception under urgency; the micro-setting of barren cracks constrains his fertilizing action and charges the final sprouts' image; tone of narrow vastness tensions the defiant flowers against indifferent ocean, evolving causally with his work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of garden reclamation signals early, with one meaningful deepening as bird calls guide him to deepest wounds, narrowing options under Accumulative/Textural lens; pressure coheres from sterilized earth and past wars, forcing stance crystallization in fertilization; agency via his actions forecloses desolation with visible cost in effort against decay; stakes feel visceral but lack a sharper ethical calculus or trade-off for higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of resilience and renewal emerges organically from seed pods, dead reef, and resurfacing concord, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the ocean's indifference; subtext in defiant petals and birds' ancient calls invites reflection on human greed's cost; final sprouts offer resonant, non-literal repricing of the battlefield premise without statement; emotional aftereffect lingers through concrete particulars like quivering petals, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward shadows and mists reflecting Elias's worldview; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, purposeful syntax like "whispering of resilience," modulating with intensity; no dialogue, so policy ignored; patterned diction teaches lyric compression early, paying off in legible closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High information density with vivid, propulsion-driven sentences like "vivid petals unfurling like defiant flags," varying rhythm naturally; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle, even in dense peak beats; clarity and concision advance atmosphere through multi-job lines without redundancies; final line resolves by recharging motifs in the harmony's whisper, passing read-aloud ear test flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of submerged concord and dead-language bird calls transforms renewal tropes through specific, grounded choices like volcanic soil dust against salted earth; core premise offers non-obvious angle on environmental redemption, feeling inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in lyric density heightens stakes without gimmickry; authenticity coheres as singular vision, avoiding stock metaphors.</comment>
