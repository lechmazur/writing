<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to reimagine civilization through poetry is clear and rooted in his revolutionary past, intensifying to compel the ceremony as a high-stakes choice with felt cost in transmuting sorrow to legacy. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in his shift from defeat to reinvention, though some emotions lean toward poetic abstraction rather than raw contradiction. The final renunciation of armed revolution for cultural unity is earned by prior causality, foreclosing violent paths with visible emotional price in the culminating poem.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through poetic shards and visions, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the new myth reweights the dispute with undeniable social cost, made legible in the group's transfixed watching and resumed digs. Orientation anchors Elias on Elysium Prime early, with time's visibility taught by ~120 words, paying off at closure without disorientation debt. One meaningful deepening via the storm ceremony tightens the narrative, holding the lens to a resonant end with felt unity as the price of old quarrels.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting is vivid and purposeful, with chronal mists and timeline tendrils constraining choices during storms, directly charging the final image of unified visions in the veiled mirrors. Sensory details like humming shards and thrummed air are selective, filtered through Elias's poetic bias, evolving causally with the ceremony to mirror internal rebirth. A recurring object (shard) constrains the etching action and charges closure, meeting the 9+ test without overreliance on visuals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resolving the archaeological dispute through poetic unity is signaled early, with one meaningful deepening in the storm ceremony that reweights options via refracted visions, forcing stance crystallization under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Agency in devising the ceremony forecloses division with felt cost in softened grief, though escalation feels more textural than sharply narrowing, with coincidence of storm complicating but not resolving. Moral calculus between empirical truth and reinvented harmony sharpens the peak, but stakes remain somewhat abstract until the final tapestry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of reinvention healing division emerges organically from Elias's verses and the shard's refraction, inviting reflection on truth versus unity without tidy morals, with ambiguity in human-alien blend lingering purposefully. Subtext in veiled mirrors and storm visions implies hidden selves, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise non-literally. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through burnished sorrow's honest complexity, tied inextricably to the protagonist's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward poetic noticing like "spectral silk" and "burnished sorrow," modulating rhythm under storm pressure without head-hopping. Prose texture is distinct in lyrical syntax and rhythm, teaching patterned elision early and paying off at closure, though some diction drifts into elevated register clashing with stress moments. Dialogue is sparse but natural, advancing unity with subtext in Elias's intonations; no major elision withheld for suspense.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose advances atmosphere through dense, purposeful imagery like "timeline tendrils coiling," with varied rhythm and high information density, but occasional paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated sorrow motifs) and template cadence in verse inscriptions dull momentum slightly without obscuring closure. Figurative language stacks in peak beats like the storm without full pattern payoff, triggering a minor density penalty, though clarity holds with strong verbs and concise sentences. No major artifacts touch the final image, but synonym churn around "burnished" reduces propulsion in mid-sections.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of visible time enabling poetic reinvention of history offers a fresh synthesis of sci-fi and literary elements, transforming revolutionary tropes through specific shard usage and mirror ceremony, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk in accumulative structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, with emotional specificity avoiding generics. Core concept commits fully, with no close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
