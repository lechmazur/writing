<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation rooted in loss intensifies compellingly to drive his network-building choices, with interiority concrete and particular, like clarity fluctuating with moon phases leading to sharpened vision under gibbous light. Internal conflict shows in waning doubt, embodied through clutching the bronze foot, revealing values with felt cost in endurance. Strength in flawed persistence without moral hedging, though secondary characters like callers apply pressure but lack deeper status dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through moon-phase shards with legible transitions, teaching pattern early via calls and relics; orientation anchors who/where/when by 120 words without disorientation debt. Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) lands on-page with felt cost of ongoing loss navigated, reweighting geography via families' returns. One meaningful deepening suffices, with hydraulics failure motivating ellipsis to human beacon.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting vividly anchors in starlit signal station with salt-rust scent and crumbling cliffs, constraining choices like building voices over failed hydraulics; micro-details like frayed phone cord and flooded basement evolve causally, charging final image of station alive with whispers. Sensory selection reflects Elias's urgency, with waves and stars mirroring internal flux. Environment pressures reverse migration, with relic censer foot as object-setting that grounds and charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of navigating loss signals early, tightening once via doubt on waning quarter forcing endurance with visible cost in clutched relic and persistent calls; under Accumulative lens, pattern break at families' arrival crystallizes stance. Agency in renunciation of isolation forecloses despair, with ethical calculus between loss and solace. Minor slip in abstract stakes occasionally not viscerally tested on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming through reverse migration emerges organically from calls and relic, inviting reflection via ambiguity in Elias's fluctuating clarity without confusion; final image of redrawn loss map offers resonant, non-literal reconfiguration. Subtext in riddles and whispers enriches complexity, avoiding morals. Strength in emotional aftereffect from shared returns, though no dramatic irony accents.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stable with clean free indirect style, perceptual signature biased by lunar pull and loss, like muddled mind under full moon; rhythmic control in fragmented replies heightens pressure. Dialogue natural and subtextual, advancing plot via cryptic directions with distinct idioms in calls. Elision of wife's letters purposeful, paid off in motivation without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose concise with high density, varying rhythm in moon-phase beats without loops; vivid images like "groaning surrender" propel momentum, multi-tasking atmosphere and character. Minor scaffold in repetitive "midnight" calls, but no clarity loss at closure. Strong verbs and specific nouns dominate, with purposeful fragments enhancing flux.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of navigation and loss via patchwork Elias and cryptic calls transforms migration trope with specific relic and lunar attribute, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk in mosaic shards heightens stakes organically. Minor hedging in generic "drowned valleys" slightly reduces boldness.</comment>
