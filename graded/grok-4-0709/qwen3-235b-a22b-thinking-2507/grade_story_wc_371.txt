<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as a creeping normality noticer is clear and intensifies through her gentle handling of hunger and gardening, revealing contradictory impulses in her guilt and quiet rebellion; interiority is concrete and embodied, as in her trembling hands dusted with soil, leading to an earned stasis in accepting absolution with felt emotional cost. The host's brief presence applies secondary pressure relevant to the theme without overwhelming the single-POV focus. Minor slip in over-articulated self-awareness during the locket discovery edges toward diagnostic speak, but it doesn't derail the final renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and reflections to a resonant reconfiguration in the final image of silence as a waiting seed, with conceptual cost legible in reweighted grief; orientation anchors early in the tea house and courtyard, and causality holds via motivated elisions like the locket's discovery tilting her stance. Closure lands on-page with undeniable pressure, though the reflective block slightly exceeds BRR allowance without a stronger micro-choice anchor, mildly softening momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard is vividly specific, with ivy-strangled statues and gurgling fountains filtering through Elara's biased perception, constraining her guerrilla gardening choices and charging the final candlelit dew on her cheek; sensory details like the bread's crackling crust and mud-caked nails integrate into action, mirroring her internal erosion of normalcy. Micro-setting of the locket and soil evolves causally, heightening thematic resonance without stalling pace.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of seeking absolution from guilt escalates through deepening reflections and the locket's discovery, forcing a stance crystallization with felt emotional cost in tears and tenuous forgiveness; one meaningful cadence shift narrows options, as gardening unearths proof of persisting beauty, though coincidence of finding the locket complicates without fully resolving, keeping pressure coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of finding sacred ordinary amid creeping loss emerges organically from particulars like the bread and locket, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer where silence becomes a seed, reweighting grief without moralizing; subtext in gestures like the host's murmur and Elara's planting invites reflection on remembrance, embracing complexity with plausible ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through embodied details, though the direct "tenuous absolution" phrasing edges toward thematic echo in the final beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Elara's selective noticing of erosion and hope, like the bread's ghost scent; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, image-rich prose that modulates with emotional intensity, teaching patterned elision early for legibility. Brief dialogue feels natural and subtextual, advancing the thematic close without convergence; minor filter-verb use in reflective passages is voice-motivated but clusters slightly under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "ivy strangled marble statues," but occasional paraphrase loops, such as repeating "tenuous absolution" across beats, dull momentum without payoff; rhythm varies naturally, though template cadence in reflective stems (e.g., "She’d noticed... She’d blamed...") appears in the middle third. No major artifacts obscure closure, and strategic telling compresses backstory efficiently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of guerrilla gardening as rebellion against creeping normality offers a fresh synthesis of loss and hope, transformed through specific details like planting in throne room steps, feeling inevitable in the locket's unearthing; risk in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though proximity to familiar post-apocalyptic motifs limits boldness slightly.</comment>
