<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The disenchanted queen's motivation is clear and intensifies through embodied grief and love for her daughter, culminating in a meaningful renunciation of weariness that forecloses her prior disenchantment with visible emotional cost. Interiority is concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses shown in her reluctant signature on the scroll versus her climb, avoiding stock phrasing. The shared exhale memory anchors her strength, revealing a hierarchy of values in the climax where she commands the fissure closed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of light and memory to a resonant reconfiguration at the end, with the queen mending the sky's wound via willful command, landing an on-page decisive change with felt cost in her transformed crown-weight. Orientation anchors early in the ridge climb, and causality holds via motivated ellipsis in dreams leading to action. The closure's charged poise reweights her disenchantment into peace, shaped by persistent grief constraining her ascent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto's shimmering walls and bleeding starlight constrain choices, charging the final image where the wound seals with a sigh, functioning as a micro-setting that pressures her command. Sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, with cold air and metallic scents mirroring her internal chill, integrated into action without stalling. The environment evolves causally, from oozing light to retraction, supporting the theme through purposeful contrast.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of mending the celestial hemorrhage escalates through density increase in firefly patterns and pooling light, forcing stance crystallization in her "Enough" command, with one meaningful deepening sufficient. Agency drives the deepening via her will, narrowing options from futility to peace, with unmistakable cost in her shed weariness. Coincidence in the fireflies complicates but does not resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming enchantment through quiet authority emerges organically from images of bleeding light and summer fireflies, culminating in a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration of crown as anchor rather than cage. Subtext in gestures like reaching with will invites reflection on love's power amid grief, avoiding tidy morals. The final dawn image reweights the premise of inevitable darkness with conceptual cost, earned through particulars without assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with distinct perceptual signature in star-scented air and viscous light, modulating rhythm under pressure without elision. Prose texture is purposeful, with syntax breathing in climb's brutality and quickening in the command. No dialogue present, so policy skips; focalization controls knowledge modestly, avoiding unwarranted certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "viscous strands of silver light" without loops or scaffold, though some metaphors border on overwriting in the grotto description. Rhythm varies naturally, with strong verbs propelling the climb and closure; no artifacts obscure the final sealing sigh. Clarity holds in peak beats, but minor register drift in "crystalline poison" slightly muddles without harming propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise of bleeding starlight as celestial wound offers a fresh synthesis of fantasy and introspection, transformed through specific queenly grief and memory, feeling inevitable in her commanding resolution. Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, avoiding tropes via organic emotional complexity. The firefly reprise provides a non-obvious inflection that recharges the theme.</comment>
