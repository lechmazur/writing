<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve names is clear and intensifies through embodied actions, with foxglove regret providing contradictory impulses that layer her fierce drive with poisonous ache; interiority is concrete, as in her humming the lullaby to awaken echoes, revealing values with visible emotional cost. No second character limits relationship crucibles, but single-POV depth excels with flaws complicating choices without hedging. The final endurance earns stasis by prior mendings, foreclosing ease at the cost of exhaustion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned mendings with density increasing via song echoes, culminating in Earned Stasis where names are safe but regret settles, reweighting the stake with felt cost in exhaustion; orientation anchors early in the opal library above clouds. Closure lands on-page with the cracked tube cradled and preparation for next, though one deeper causal link could tighten the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The opal library above clouds is vividly specific, with refracted light and crystalline corridors constraining Elara's systematic checks and mendings; sensory details like glinting fractures and opal glow mirror internal regret, charging the final image of fragile archive against dark. Environment pressures choices, as alcoves and shelves guide her path, evolving causally with each pulse of light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving names tightens through accelerating decay, with deepenings in each mending narrowing options under textural lens; agency drives song-based resolutions, but cost feels more accumulative than sharply visible in the climax. Coherent pressure forces stance crystallization in the atrium, reweighting unconditional love with emotional forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of preserving extinct emotions emerges organically from orchid images and song echoes, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in foxglove regret's beauty and ache; final image of Elara slumped yet preparing offers resonant, non-literal repricing of duty's cost without statement. Subtext in fractured chimes implies oblivion's threat, enriching complexity through grandmother's woven wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct lyrical texture in syntax and rhythm, as in "her foxglove regret thick as the library’s dust—sweetly poisonous"; perceptual signature biases toward opal refractions and fading lights, modulating under stress without elision issues. No dialogue, but voice coherence heightens emotional beats purposefully.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, as in the multi-job sentence describing the chime's crack "glinting like a wound"; minor figurative density in peak mendings borders overwriting but pays off in resonance without loops or artifacts. Clarity and concision advance atmosphere, though one scaffold phrase like "deserted marvels surrounded her" repeats near-duplicately.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of extinct feelings in opal blooms and song-mending transforms preservation tropes into non-obvious emotional archive; ingenuity in foxglove regret as tone feels inevitable, heightening stakes through risk-taking lyricism without gimmickry. Core premise commits fully, avoiding generic abstractions with specific chimes and names.</comment>
