<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ms. Thorne's motivation to restore harmony is rooted in consistent traits of patience and insight, intensifying through her reflective handling of the rosette to compel the high-stakes choice of a silence-based rehearsal; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in her resigned yet firm tone during the auditorium scene. Emotions are embodied without therapy-speak dominating, and her flaws, like initial resignation, complicate choices leading to earned endurance with felt cost in the arduous unlearning process. The choir members, as secondary pressures, apply relevant conflict without full depth, but this fits the single-POV scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned reflections and motifs like noise subtraction, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration at the final concert where the rosette reweights the premise with conceptual cost of preserved empathy; orientation anchors early in the library, and causality holds via motivated insights without breaks. One meaningful deepening occurs as rehearsals transform, narrowing options from discord to harmony with felt cost in the weeks of unlearning. The closure lands on-page with the rich silence resonating, charging the final image without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The velvet library in autumn is vividly anchored with sensory details like dust motes and decaying paper, filtered through Ms. Thorne's POV to reflect her need for stillness; it constrains choices by providing the rosette as a tool and evolves to host the climax, charging the final image with its hush as perfect acoustics. Micro-setting details, like the leaded windows and bowed shelves, mirror internal states and guide action without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of restoring choir harmony escalates through a cadence shift from discord to listening, with one meaningful deepening in the silence exercise that narrows options and forces stance crystallization; cost is legible in the arduous unlearning and fractured relationships, though coincidence in inspirations slightly complicates without resolving. Agency drives the rehearsal change, foreclosing passive resentment with visible emotional price at the concert.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of preserving vanishing arts through empathy emerges organically from the rosette motif and choir conflicts, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer at the final silence that reweights prior divisions without moralizing; subtext in gestures like clenched jaws and tremors adds complexity, inviting reflection on unspoken noise. Emotional aftereffect is concrete via the rich resonance, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward auditory motifs like zither sounds and silence, modulating rhythm under pressure without head-hopping; dialogue is natural, subtext-laden, and advances plot, as in Ms. Thorne's low-voiced instructions carrying stillness. Prose texture is distinct in syntax that breathes with reflections, teaching patterned elision early and paying off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally—short sentences in tense rehearsals contrast longer reflective flows—advancing atmosphere without loops; some figurative language like "dust motes danced" is purposeful but borders on cliché in peak beats, slightly muddling without harming clarity. No major artifacts obscure cause/effect, and the final line resolves by recharging the rosette motif effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise transforms the trope of fractured community through the fresh synthesis of a zither rosette as metaphor for subtracting noise, feeling inevitable in the library concert's reconfiguration; risk in the silence-based method heightens stakes organically without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in unlearning hatred avoids generics, though some familiar choir-drama elements limit top originality.</comment>
