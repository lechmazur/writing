<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's motivation to grant rest is clear and rooted in his stubborn, weary traits, intensifying to compel his descent and restoration; interiority is concrete with embodied exhaustion, like shoulders slumped from coffins, but internal conflict feels more summarized than simultaneous in key moments. The final endurance defers his own rest with felt cost, earning stasis through prior causality. Relationships and status are irrelevant as no second character appears on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure links package arrival to descent and restoration via motivated choices, with orientation anchored by the first sentence in the lighthouse; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration where the lens's beam grants rest to spirits but defers Silas's own, with visible cost in his perpetual vigil. One meaningful tightening suffices, but the ascent back is implied rather than shown, slightly softening the final reconfiguration's immediacy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underwater library setting is vivid and purposeful, with silt-covered shelves and spectral jellyfish constraining Silas's climb and restoration; sensory details like cold glass and seeping saltwater are POV-filtered and evolve causally, charging the final image of the beam sweeping ruins. The environment directly shapes the climax by providing tools and housing for the lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of granting permanent rest tightens causally during the spire climb and lens alignment, narrowing options under ocean pressure; agency in revitalizing the lens forecloses his own peace with felt cost, but escalation relies on descriptive deepening more than sharp reversals. Under Causal lens, one meaningful intensification via the prism transformation suffices, though coincidence of finding intact housing slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of chasing elusive rest emerges organically from Silas's actions and the spirits' dissolution, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights his vigil without moralizing; subtext in the fractured lens as flawed peace invites reflection on deferred resolution. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature in Silas's weary, tactile noticing, like tracing the crack; voice texture is distinct and rhythmic, modulating with pressure in the descent's compression. No dialogue present, so those bullets ignored; purposeful lyric compression teaches patterns early and pays off at closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "spectral jellyfish" without loops, though some figurative stacking in the library description borders on overwriting without harming clarity. Rhythm varies naturally, propelling to the beam's pulse; no artifacts touch closure, but minor scaffold in repetitive "rest" phrasing deducts slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise of an undertaker diving to restore an underwater lighthouse lens for spectral rest offers fresh synthesis, transforming tropes like drowned cities through Silas's occupational lens; risk in the deferred vigil heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
