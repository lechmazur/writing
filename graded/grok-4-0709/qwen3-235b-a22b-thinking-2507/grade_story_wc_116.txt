<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as chronicle keeper is consistently rooted in her vow to witness without judgment, intensifying to compel her high-stakes choice during the tremor; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in her panic to act versus retreating to observe. The final renunciation is earned through prior causality, foreclosing intervention with the felt cost of losing the Codices but accepting transformation. This aligns with single-POV baseline, revealing hierarchy of values via micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with density increasing through descriptive builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) at the collapse observation, reweighting knowledge as transformation with conceptual cost legible in the fungi's glow. Orientation anchors who (Elara), where (catacombs library), and when (across seasons) by ~120 words without debt. Closure lands on-page with cost, but one ellipsis in burrowing feels slightly under-motivated, though it doesn't break the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The overgrown library and obsidian refuge are vivid with purposeful sensory details like mildew scent and black water lapping, filtered through Elara's biased perception; these constrain choices, such as retreating to the refuge for mending, and charge the final image of acceptance by the river. Micro-setting of the origami swan functions as a tool that evolves causally, enhancing specificity without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of witnessing change without judgment tightens meaningfully at the tremor, deepening via her burrowing choice that narrows options and reweights cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens; agency in renunciation forecloses action with legible conceptual price in the Codices' transformation. One reversal suffices at this length, but the pressure feels slightly diffuse before the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of accepting transformation over preservation emerges organically from events like the collapse observation, with subtext in images of dust becoming loam; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting knowledge's form without moralizing. Purposeful ambiguity invites reflection on change's inevitability, tied to Elara's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with distinct perceptual signature in Elara's loose grip on reality shaping selective noticing, like shadows as living things; prose texture modulates rhythmically with emotional intensity, teaching patterned elision in burrowing that pays off at closure. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and character via vivid images like "dust motes dancing"; zero loops or scaffold, syntactic variety supports propulsion, and figurative language like "reality yielded like thick fabric" enhances without muddle in peak beats. Opening anchors voice, final line recharges motifs with the pen dipping like the river.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical origami navigation and regenerative silence transforms library guardian tropes through Elara's specific worldview; the non-obvious burrowing into silence heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry. Risk-taking in conceptual repricing elevates coherence.</comment>
