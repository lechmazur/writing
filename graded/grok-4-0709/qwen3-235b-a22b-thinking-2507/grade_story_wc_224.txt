<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to reclaim the shape of home is rooted in grief and intensifies through embodied choices, like using the feather, revealing contradictory impulses between avoidance and confrontation; interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions embodied in tears and sensations rather than labels. The final renunciation of seeking externally forecloses her old path with visible cost, earning stasis through prior accumulation. No stock phrasing dilutes the specificity, and her flaws complicate the journey without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elision and sensory density toward a resonant reconfiguration, with orientation anchored early in the bookstore-mountain; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing where home is repriced as internal architecture, with felt cost in tears and grief. One meaningful deepening tightens via the stone's activation, reweighting knowledge without causality breaks. Minor ambiguity in dream-reality shifts serves the pattern and charges the final image without disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore-mountain setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like dusty spines and humming vibrations filtered through Elara's urgency, constraining choices in navigation and dream shifts; it evolves causally, mirroring her internal state without overt symbolism. A recurring object (feather) charges the final image, constraining the closure act. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, and the environment pressures tactics, like corridors folding like origami.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of understanding home escalates through density increase in sensations and realizations, with one meaningful deepening at the stone's activation that reweights options; agency in seeding the feather forecloses external seeking with felt cost in surging grief. Pressure coheres until the final reconfiguration, though coincidence in the stone's appearance complicates without resolving. Moral calculus between remembering's pain and healing sharpens the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of home as internal geometry emerges organically from images like glyphs translating to sensations, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in memory's balm versus scorch; subtext in silences and implications, like the feather's texture, invites reflection. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer, repricing belonging without statement. Emotional aftereffect is concrete, avoiding sentimentality through embodied tears.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward textural details like feather's sigh and ink-bleeding books, modulating rhythm under pressure; no dialogue, so policy skips those bullets. Patterned elision in dream shifts is taught early and pays off at closure without obscurity. Diction fits the focalizer's lexicon, with syntax reflecting her introspective state.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally—short breaths in action, longer in reflection—advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold; metaphors like corridors folding like origami are coherent and purposeful, enhancing propulsion. No artifacts obscure closure, with strong verbs and specific nouns dominating. Final line resolves by recharging motifs like the mercury-glass, passing read-aloud test cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise of a mountain-bookstore with nightly reality shifts offers fresh synthesis of loss and linguistics, transforming tropes like buried talents through specific details like feather-seeding; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional complexity feels authentic, with non-obvious reconfiguration inevitable in hindsight. Avoids derivative templates via singular vision.</comment>
