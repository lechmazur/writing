<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in debunking traits intensifies to compel the reconstruction and realization; interiority concrete with embodied contradiction in dismissing curses yet feeling the truth's weight; final choice earns stasis with visible cost in "the weight of truth heavier than any stone."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages from search to discovery to revelation; orientation anchors early in the dust storm and orchards; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page with conceptual cost of betrayal's scope, reshaping options without unresolved ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "irradiated gravel" and "gnarled apple trees" reflect POV bias and urgency; setting constrains choices in the stillpoint's calm; recurring orchard environment charges the final image as she walks into the storm, reweighting survival.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth excavation tightens causally through document reassembly, narrowing options and deepening knowledge; protagonist agency drives escalation with legible cost in trembling hands and intuited betrayal; one meaningful intensification suffices, forcing stance crystallization under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of deliberate lies versus excavated truth emerges organically from events and images like the flawed diamond; subtext in superstition dismissal adds complexity; final image offers resonant, non-literal reconfiguration of suffering's architecture without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature in sharp observations; prose texture modulates rhythm purposefully, heightening discovery beats; no dialogue, but elision in reflective moments is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied syntax, advancing atmosphere in lines like "hour bled into hour"; minor scaffold in repetitive storm descriptors, but no loops obscure closure; clarity strong, with purposeful metaphors enhancing momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic conspiracy with engineered orchards transforms tropes through specific details like Project Verdant; risk in conceptual reveal heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the reassembled letters' chilling phrase.</comment>
