<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to spark a silent revolution is clear and rooted in her grandfather's legacy, intensifying through precise actions like aligning the quill holder; interiority is concrete with embodied contradictions, such as her hammering heart against steady hands in the sundial moment. The single-POV focus reveals character through micro-choices under pressure, earning the final resolve with felt risk, though secondary characters are absent, limiting relational crucibles.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the plot progresses through motivated actions from blackout opportunity to sundial decoding, anchoring orientation early in the West Parapet scene; closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost in the whispering blaze, shaped by persistent constraints like obscured moonlight. One meaningful tightening suffices, but ellipsis in the final descent feels slightly under-motivated without a micro-turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The luminous fort at twilight, amplified by blackout, vividly anchors sensory details through Elara's POV, with the Garden of Whispers constraining her delicate alignment choice; the sundial as micro-setting charges the final image of earth’s quiet embrace, mirroring internal resolve without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of igniting the revolution before dawn tightens causally via blackout pressure, forcing Elara's descent and decoding with narrowing options; agency in her precise rotation forecloses paths with felt cost in potential misalignment dooming them, though coincidence of distant lights complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of silent change emerges organically from the sundial's coded angles and quill holder's notches, resisting tidy morals through ambiguity in the whispering blaze; the final image offers resonant repricing of oppression without stated moral, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual signature in Elara's sharp eyes and calm inventiveness, modulating rhythm under stress like silent ash movements; prose texture is distinct and purposeful, with no dialogue to evaluate, and elision in the blackout hush pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, as in the humming stones amplifying footfalls, avoiding loops though some metaphors like "winking hush" border on muddle; high information density advances atmosphere without artifacts touching closure, but occasional elevated diction slightly drifts from POV lexicon in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The premise transforms revolution tropes through the half-painted sundial's geometric cipher and quill holder's notches, synthesizing fresh ingenuity in a non-obvious silent signal; risk-taking in the coded intrigue heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the cradle's awakening without gimmickry.</comment>
