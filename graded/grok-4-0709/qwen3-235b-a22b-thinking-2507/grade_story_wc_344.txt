<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to learn the rhythm of repair is clear and intensifies through her actions, rooted in concrete interiority like tracing gears and driftwood nostalgia; emotions are embodied in numb fingers and fogged breath, showing contradictory impulses between past warmth and present duty. The final renunciation of force for communion earns a meaningful change with felt cost in her softened nostalgia. Minor slip in stock phrasing like "ghost of time" slightly flattens specificity, but it doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery of ice and reflections toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the gentle gear placement and click, with conceptual cost in reweighted repair as communion; orientation anchors early in the chisel and frozen library. Closure lands on-page with the Orrery turning and morning beginning, reweighting the stake. Persistent constraint of the eclipse's shadow shapes tactics effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The frozen library above clouds is vividly specific, with sensory details like crunching frost and glowing ice integrated into action; it constrains choices in the Hall of Mirrors, where reflections disorient and charge the final synchronized nod. Atmosphere of haunting brightness evolves with the eclipse, mirroring internal stasis to reconfiguration. Recurring ice and gears as micro-setting charge the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mending the Orrery to avert perpetual twilight tightens meaningfully during the eclipse totality, forcing stance crystallization from force to listening under Accumulative/Textural lens; agency in uncapping forecloses forceful paths with felt cost in her weary reflections. One deepening suffices, with pressure coherent and growing via shadow and seized mechanism. Coincidence of prophecy scraps complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of repair as communion over conquest emerges organically through images like the throb beneath ice and prophecy scraps, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer at the click and turning gears that reweights prior force attempts. Subtext in reflections and nostalgia adds complexity without confusion. Final image elicits emotional aftereffect of quiet pride, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in selective noticing of frost and gears, biased by her locksmith role; voice texture in rhythmic, poetic syntax holds under pressure, with purposeful compression in reflections taught early. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets. Elision of broader world pays off in focused closure without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in short taps and longer reflections; strong verbs and specific nouns propel momentum, like "chisel bit into the library's frozen breath." Minor overwriting in mixed metaphors (e.g., "sky bled pale lavender" and "time's wreckage") creates slight muddle but doesn't obscure closure; no loops or artifacts touch the final click and surge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lunar-eclipse locksmith in a frozen aerial library transforms fantasy tropes through specific details like prophecy scraps and listening repair; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable at the synchronized reflections. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on time mending with emotional specificity.</comment>
