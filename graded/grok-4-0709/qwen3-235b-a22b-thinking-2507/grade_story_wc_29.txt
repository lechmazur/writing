<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear and rooted in his role as interpreter, intensifying to compel his unorthodox action; interiority is concrete, with embodied hope amid division, shown in his steady hands rerouting power despite alarms. Internal conflict emerges through contradictory impulses of hope and awareness of fragility, as in clinging to charts while ignoring protests. The final endurance forecloses easy resolution with felt cost of the power surge, earning cautious hope without stock epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages, from signal anomaly to subsonic interference leading to cleared signal and surge; orientation anchors early with Aris in the station amid protests. Closure is a Charged Poise in stepping out with the chart as banner, reconfiguring options with visible cost of strained system and potential shutdown. One meaningful tightening suffices, but the surge's fragility adds resonant reconfiguration without unmotivated leaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting anchors vividly in the university radio station with reinforced windows and protests outside, evolving causally as vibrations resonate through bedrock; sensory details like humming station and static headset are selective, reflecting Aris's urgency. The environment constrains choice by providing grounding rods for his method, charging the final image of subsonic pulse echoing below strife. Micro-setting of charts and oscilloscope integrates into action, mirroring internal resistance without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of outwitting cosmic tricksters amid earthly power plays signals early and tightens through the subsonic gamble, narrowing options with the power surge as legible cost. Under causal lens, escalation drives agency in rerouting power, forcing stance crystallization without coincidence resolving it. One deepening suffices, with moral calculus between interference and shutdown sharpening the peak choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of power plays mirroring earthly and cosmic deception emerges organically from events like signal mimicry and protests, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in fragile victory. Subtext in gestures like rolling the chart as banner invites reflection on defiance amid division. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer by repricing truth's cost, eliciting aftereffect without assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward signals and charts, modulating rhythm under pressure like narrowed focus during calibration. Prose texture is distinct in syntax blending technical terms with ethereal grit, without register drift. No dialogue, so policy skips; elision in ignoring protests serves emotional beats cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing through images like smudged charts and humming station; rhythm varies naturally, but occasional overwriting in metaphors like "academic knives unsheathed" muddles in non-peak beats without harming closure. No major loops or artifacts obscure cause/effect, with strong verbs propelling to the final clean whisper. Information density shines in multifunctional lines during the pulse calibration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of astronomy with subsonic interference transforms sci-fi tropes through grounded choices like repurposing grounding rods, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Core premise offers fresh angle on deception, with risk-taking in unorthodox method heightening stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in ethereal grit avoids generics, committing to premise's implications.</comment>
