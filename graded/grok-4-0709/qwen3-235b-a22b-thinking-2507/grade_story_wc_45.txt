<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to mend her fractured worldview is clear and intensifies through reflections, compelling her to repurpose the tooth as a beacon; interiority is concrete, with embodied regret in tracing the tooth's curve, showing contradictory impulses of skepticism and wonder. Finn's shrewd innocence pressures her gently, altering her stance. Some emotional progression feels slightly tidy, but flaws complicate choices without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, reflections build density through patterned images like fractures and constellations, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the tooth illuminates darkness with felt cost of regret etched in bone. Orientation anchors early in the secret garden. One meaningful deepening suffices, but minor paraphrase loops in backstory slightly dilute causality without breaking the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The secret garden hidden behind the hedge maze is vivid and purposeful, with dew on rose petals and the stone well filtering Elara's biased perception; it constrains choices by providing the tooth's discovery site and evolves to a workshop for the soul, charging the final image of planting seeds in shadows. Sensory details balance senses selectively, mirroring internal fractures.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mending fractured certainty escalates through accumulative pressure of reflections and Finn's injury, deepening via bone-setting analogy to force stance crystallization on acceptance; one tightening narrows options, with visible cost in enduring scars. Coherent under textural lens, but stakes occasionally feel abstract until the tooth's repurposing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of turning fractures into guiding stars emerges organically from images like the cleft in certainty and changeling's tooth, inviting reflection on skepticism coexisting with wonder; final image offers resonant, non-literal answer by forging pain into light without moralizing. Subtext in Finn's questions adds complexity, avoiding tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward nostalgic innovation in phrases like "nostalgia warming her chest like afternoon sun"; dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances theme, as in Finn's star questions. Rhythmic control modulates with emotional intensity, but minor filter verbs in reflections slightly dull immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in reflective passages like "carving a cleft in certainty that left her worldview fractured like dropped porcelain"; some paraphrase loops, such as repeated fracture motifs, create minor redundancy without obscuring closure. Information advances atmosphere effectively, but occasional stock metaphors like "etching in bone and regret" trend generic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of changeling folklore with bone-setting metaphor transforms tropes through Elara's specific arc from arrogance to grace, feeling inevitable in the garden's repurposing; risk in nostalgic innovation heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Avoids derivative premises by grounding in emotional complexity.</comment>
