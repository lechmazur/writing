<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strength in Silas's embodied internal conflict, with contradictory impulses shown in his plea "Don’t. You’ll vanish" clashing with acceptance of the orchard's revival; motivation roots in consistent traits like his long tending, intensifying to compel endurance with felt cost; minor weakness in ghost bride's traits feeling somewhat archetypal without deeper contradiction in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density increase via recurring images like the bead and veil, culminating in resonant reconfiguration with undeniable cost in her dissolution; closure lands on-page with the bead left inert, reweighting the debt; orientation anchors early in the greenhouse setting, and persistent constraint of winter hush shapes the final mournful elation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Greenhouse setting vividly anchors perpetual night and alchemical details, constraining choices like the ghost's movement toward withering plants; sensory specificity through fogged breath and crystalline notes mirrors internal sorrow; recurring bead object charges the final image, elevating to high band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of orchard survival tightens through her bead use, deepening via textural pattern break in the explosive resonance; agency in her renunciation forecloses her existence with visible cost, charging the ending under Accumulative lens; one meaningful intensification suffices, though coincidence of her appearance slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of paradoxical debt repayment emerges organically from images like lovingly venomous awakenings, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in her smile's mournful elation; final image offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting healing and harm without statement; subtext in gestures deepens complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Silas's biased noticing of trembling petals and fogged breath, with rhythmic control accelerating in the climax chord; dialogue natural and subtextual, like her whispered "The debt is due," advancing stakes; no head-hopping in single POV, elision of her full past taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with sentences like "Her form woven from ash and starlight" advancing atmosphere and character; varied rhythm avoids loops, though minor scaffold in backstory block slightly pads without harming closure; no figurative muddle, propulsion strong in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical ghost story with resonant debt, transforming haunted trope through specific bead mechanics and lovingly venomous paradox; risk in textural accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry; minor derivative echo in past-life vow break, but grounded in particulars.</comment>
