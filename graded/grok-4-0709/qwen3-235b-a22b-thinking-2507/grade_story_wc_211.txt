<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to preserve emotional patterns intensifies compellingly toward the prophecy's revelation, with embodied dread and contradictory impulses shown in his immersion choice; interiority is concrete, as in clutching the burning shaving, revealing flaws without stock labels. The childhood memory anchors a micro-choice that tilts his present stance, earning the final renunciation with visible cost. Single-POV focus excels, but minor therapy-speak in "pure, untranslatable loss" slightly flattens emotional contradiction at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and cadence shifts, culminating in a valid Conceptual Repricing where the archive becomes a tomb with undeniable conceptual cost in the dissolving shaving and awakening roots. Orientation anchors early in the orchard, with the memory shard transition justified and paying off at closure. One meaningful deepening suffices, but slight redundancy in prophecy echoes mildly dilutes propulsion without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The orchard atop the skyscraper is vividly sensory, with decaying apples and damp earth mirroring Elias's dread, constraining his immersion and charging the final image of glass apples; micro-setting like the roots gripping steel evolves causally, heightening atmosphere without static repetition. Details filter through POV bias, evolving with events like the falling apple, meeting the 9+ test by directly shaping closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of archiving emotions tightens through the prophecy's deepening revelation, forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative/Textural pressure with legible cost in Elias's silent scream; one meaningful cadence shift narrows options, driven by agency in immersing via memory. Coincidence of the shaving's origin complicates without resolving, but stakes occasionally feel abstract until the glass apples moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of preservation's futility emerges organically through recurring apple and root motifs, reweighted in the final image without moralizing; subtext in the shaving's "ghost’s sigh" invites ambiguity on human resonance's end. Emotional aftereffect lingers via conceptual repricing, but minor overt symbolism in "velvet disquiet" borders on assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable, with perceptual signature in Elias's language fluency biasing notices; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, lyric prose that modulates with dread, teaching patterned elision early. Dialogue is sparse but natural, as in the child's Ugaritic murmur advancing plot via subtext; minor register drift in elevated diction under stress slightly disrupts at peak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose density is high, with vivid images like "apples turn to glass" propelling atmosphere without loops; syntactic variety breathes with pressure, but occasional mixed metaphors (e.g., "velvet disquiet" to "suffocating embrace") create minor muddle in peak beats. No major artifacts obscure closure, passing the 9+ test threshold but capped by slight overwriting in the orchard description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oath-scribing with accidental prophecy transforms memory tropes through specific skyscraper orchard and dead-language mechanics, feeling inevitable at the roots' awakening; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, meeting the 9+ test with non-obvious emotional archiving angle.</comment>
