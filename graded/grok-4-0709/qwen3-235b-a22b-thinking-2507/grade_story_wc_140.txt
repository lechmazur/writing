<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation from the death certificate error drives consistent, intensifying choices like collecting fragments, with embodied emotions in textures like "wet sand" and "rough grain"; interior conflict shows in the hollow ache versus purposeful layering, earning the final renunciation of official identity. However, some stock phrasing in reflections slightly abstracts the contradictions, though micro-choices under tidal pressure reveal values with felt cost at dawn's offering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through layered fragments toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where Elias reweights identity as archivist, with conceptual cost in ongoing erasure legible in the final mudflat offering; orientation anchors early in the mudflats and container labyrinth. One meaningful deepening suffices, as overheard stories accumulate to reconfigure meaning without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The port city's tidal rhythm and container labyrinth constrain choices, pressuring retreats and advances, while recurring objects like the poison label charge the final image; sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, with brackish water and rusted underbelly mirroring internal absence. Environment evolves causally with tides, guiding the accumulative discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming erased history tightens through accumulating fragments, with one meaningful cadence shift at the sister's voice confirming cover-up, forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is felt in the hollow ache and foreclosed legal identity, charging the ending without coincidence resolving. Agency in layering and etching forecloses passive drifting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of rebuilding erased histories emerges from concrete fragments and motifs like tides and labels, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer at the mudflat offering that reweights memory as tactile archive; subtext in silences and implications avoids direct statements, inviting reflection on bureaucratic erasures without tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable, with perceptual signature in filtered absences and textures; prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, lyric compression that teaches patterns early, paying off at closure. Overheard dialogue carries subtext and advances accumulation naturally, though indirect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm to match tidal cadence, but minor paraphrase loops like repeated "texture" and "erased" in adjacent reflections slightly dull momentum without obscuring closure. Figurative language is controlled, with metaphors like "grief felt like wet sand" advancing atmosphere effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bureaucratic error and port labyrinth transforms erasure trope through tactile memory layering, with risk in accumulative structure heightening stakes organically; the non-obvious angle on identity as chosen archive feels inevitable at the mudflat marker.</comment>
