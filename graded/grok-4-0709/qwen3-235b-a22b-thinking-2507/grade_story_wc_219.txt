<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of first contact with chemical homecoming transforms sci-fi tropes through Elara's rebellious lens, with risk-taking in lyric accumulations heightening stakes organically; the spectrometer spike feels inevitable, reweighting the premise without gimmickry.</comment>
