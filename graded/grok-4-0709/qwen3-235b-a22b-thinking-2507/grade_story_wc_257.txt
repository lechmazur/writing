<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation evolves credibly from grief to renewal, rooted in embodied emotions like tracing the locket and the spark in her chest, with contradictory impulses shown in her doubt during the rain-lashed Tuesday. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, as seen in her shift from memorializing death to embedding seeds. The final renunciation of pure mourning forecloses her old path with felt cost, evident in tears and the steady ember. Strength lies in micro-choices under pressure, like adjusting the curtains, revealing her hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned motifs of dust, light, and blooms, with density increasing toward the illumination climax. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via the projected light and returned origami, reweighting her grief with conceptual cost legible in the promise of bloom. Orientation anchors early in the observatory annex, avoiding penalties. Key strength is the earned final image, though minor ellipsis in city responses slightly softens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The observatory setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like aged paper scent and dust motes constraining choices, such as using gears and lantern for illumination. It charges the final image by projecting floral patterns outward, mirroring internal renewal. POV filters details selectively, evolving causally from neglected to activated. Micro-setting of the curtains and gantry directly shapes the climax, meeting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of overcoming grief tightens through deepening actions like leaving origami and aligning curtains, under Accumulative/Textural lens, with one meaningful cadence shift at illumination narrowing options from doubt to hope. Cost is felt in tears and prior rock bottom, charging the ending. Agency drives the projection, foreclosing isolation with community validation. Weakness in abstract stakes occasionally feeling less visceral, but pressure coheres to stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges organically from images like dormant seeds and projected blooms, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in communal response. Subtext in silence and implication, as in the artist's note, invites reflection on intention and life. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via the returned origami, reweighting withering as fertile, meeting 9+ test. Strength in emotional honesty avoiding sentimentality, though some direct statements like "teaching withering to bloom" border on assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Elara's biased noticing of absence and resilience, modulating rhythm under pressure like the steadying breath. Prose texture distinct in lyrical syntax, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; focalization controlled without leakage. Strength in prose as character, reflecting her subdued ardor without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and character, like the dust motes dancing in light. Rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops, though some figurative language in peak beats like "spark, fragile as moth wings" borders on density overload without muddle. Clarity strong, with strong verbs and specific details propelling momentum to closure. Minor scaffold in repetitive bloom motifs, but no artifacts touch ending, allowing high band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mourning jewelry with cosmic intention and origami coordinates feels inevitable, transforming grief tropes through specific details like seed-embedded orbs. Risk-taking in projective light heightens stakes organically, without gimmickry, meeting 9+ test. Fresh angle on renewal via earth-bound constellations avoids derivatives. Strength in authentic vision cohering voice and premise, with bold final reconfiguration.</comment>
