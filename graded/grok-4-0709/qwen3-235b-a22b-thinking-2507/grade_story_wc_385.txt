<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaela's motivation to uncover the echo truth is clear and rooted in her brother's loss, intensifying through her decision to sing progressively despite risks, with embodied perceptions like feeling vibrations in the rock strengthening interiority. However, emotions occasionally veer into performed melancholy, such as the "reed-blown" metaphor repeated as a label rather than contradictory impulses in scene. The final renunciation of safety feels earned with visible cost, but internal conflict alternates summaries instead of simultaneous pulls.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of hums and echoes toward a Charged Poise closure where Kaela's determination to sing reconfigures stakes with felt risk of Council pursuit. Orientation anchors early in the serpentine nexus under starlight, and causality holds via progressive revelations narrowing her options. The ending's resonant promise lands on-page with conceptual cost, though one ellipsis in Renn's departure feels slightly unmotivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The canyon setting is vivid and purposeful, with sandstone vibrations and starlit crags constraining Kaela's perceptions and charging the final image of singing to the canyon's answer. Sensory details like cool sandstone and humming universe are filtered through her richly perceptive POV, mirroring internal urgency. A recurring object like the seashell integrates as micro-setting, evolving to confirm safety and key the gene map.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, conflict escalates through density of intrigue and a pattern break in Renn's revelation about the resonance gene, tightening stakes around Kaela's decision to disclose progressively with clear risk of silencing. The dominant stake of ensuring echo truth survival is signaled early and deepens once meaningfully, but cost feels more declared than viscerally tested on-page. Agency in her plan to sing fragments forecloses safety with legible pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of suppressed truths and selective echoes emerges organically from Kaela's quest and the Council's intrigue, with subtext in the seashell's hum implying bridges to deeper songs. The final image of lifting the seashell offers a resonant, non-literal answer to why some echo, reweighting her motivation without moralizing. However, reed-blown melancholy borders on overt symbolism, slightly diluting complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature in Kaela's vibration-sensing bias creating distinct texture through rhythmic, humming prose. Dialogue feels natural and subtextual, advancing plot via Renn's warnings and revelations without exposition dumps. Patterned elision in cosmic hums is taught early and pays off at closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density in images like "liquid silver" echoes, but occasional paraphrase loops, such as repeated melancholy descriptions, dull momentum slightly without payoff. Rhythm varies naturally, supporting atmosphere, though some metaphors like "sliver of bone" mix without contradiction. No major artifacts touch closure, but template cadence in reflective blocks adds minor drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise of echo-singers in a conspiratorial canyon offers a fresh synthesis of mysticism and intrigue, transformed through specific details like the resonance gene and progressive disclosure method. Risk-taking in lyric texture heightens stakes without gimmickry, but echoes familiar fantasy tropes without fully subverting them. The seashell as key feels organic, not checklist-driven.</comment>
