<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation as a gentle radical is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in traits that drive his search and confrontation; interiority is concrete with embodied emotions, like the tessera "biting his palm," revealing contradictory impulses of empathy and resolve. The final renunciation of the council's lies earns a meaningful change with felt cost, foreclosing vengeance for healing. Varr as secondary character applies pressure effectively, though his shift feels slightly abrupt without deeper status dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure flows with because/therefore linkages from discovery to vision to revelation and confrontation, anchoring orientation early in the ash-dusted plaza; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via the crews lowering tools, with visible cost in challenging authority and reweighting the plaza's meaning. One meaningful tightening suffices, but the vision's ellipsis is motivated well. Minor redundancy in reflective summaries slightly softens causality without breaking it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ancient plaza beneath a shattered sky is vividly specific, with sensory details like warm stones and turquoise glaze filtering through Kael's bias, constraining choices like sifting debris and fitting the tessera; it charges the final image as a threshold, mirroring internal healing. Atmosphere tensions warm coldness purposefully, evolving causally from ash to revealed script.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving truth against erasure signals early and tightens once through the vision and tessera fit, narrowing options and forcing stance crystallization in the confrontation; cost is felt in Varr's faltering and the crews' pause, with agency in Kael's insistence. Under Causal lens, pressure coheres but lacks a second deepening for higher escalation. Moral calculus between mercy and vengeance sharpens the peak effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of aberrant mercy emerges organically from events like the vision of soldiers' exhaustion and the revealed script, inviting reflection on healing truths without tidy morals; subtext in gestures, like holding the tessera high, and the final image offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration of victory. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature in Kael's biased noticing of fractures and glazes; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, image-rich prose that modulates with intensity, like gasping back to the plaza. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances plot in the confrontation with Varr, distinguishing idioms effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing through vivid images like "cradle empathy in arms of steel," but minor overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., "warm coldness" paradox) creates slight muddle without harming clarity; rhythm varies naturally, though one paraphrase loop in reflective blocks dulls momentum slightly. No major artifacts touch closure, and syntax propels well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of retrocognition, historical mercy, and radical compassion feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes like hidden truths through specific mosaic mechanics and ethical risks; the vision's aberrant mercy offers a non-obvious angle on vengeance, heightening stakes organically. Bold risk in lyric imagery coheres without gimmickry.</comment>
