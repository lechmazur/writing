<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to seek ordinary miracles through presence is clear and intensifies via her polishing action, revealing contradictory impulses in her grief; Chen's guarded posture and relic avoidance embody his flaws effectively. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like whitening knuckles showing stress without therapy-speak. The final nod earns endurance with felt cost of unspoken healing. Minor stock phrasing in accident recall slightly flattens specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, textural details build to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the shared nod and polished bowl, with conceptual cost of quiet courage legible in the final image. Orientation anchors who (Elara), where (workshop), and when (morning fog) by the first sentence. Single scene fits scope, with one meaningful deepening via her silent action. No causality breaks, but ellipsis in grief mapping feels slightly under-motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The workshop's damp wool, brass, and dripping clepsydra constrain Elara's sensory world, charging the final image of fog lifting with emotional release. Sensory details are selective, POV-biased toward absence of smell, mirroring her loss. Fog and tools evolve causally, affecting choices like watching hands. Environment pressures the quiet embrace, meeting 9+ test by constraining her polishing micro-choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unveiling miracles through presence tightens via her polishing, deepening emotional connection under textural lens with felt cost in vulnerability. One meaningful cadence shift narrows options, forcing stance crystallization. Agency in renunciation of words earns the nod's reconfiguration. Coincidence of fog adds complication without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of humanizing silence amid loss emerges from particulars like the screw relic and polishing, offering resonant ambiguity in shared courage without moralizing. Subtext in gestures and avoided objects builds emotional honesty. Final image reweights premise non-literally, embracing complexity. Epiphany earned through scene, but slight thematic echo in "ordinary miracle" phrasing dings it slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stays stable, with perceptual signature in scentless mechanics and emotional mapping. Voice texture is distinct, rhythmic, with purposeful compression in reflections. Sparse dialogue carries subtext, like Chen's murmur advancing connection. Meets 9+ with rhythmic control under pressure and no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise, with high density in images like whitening knuckles advancing character and atmosphere; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in polishing beat. No loops or scaffold, strong verbs dominate, and metaphors cohere without muddle. Final line recharges motifs effectively. Minor filter-verb in one reflection slightly dulls immediacy but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of anosmia and horology transforms loss tropes through occluded views and relic screw, feeling inevitable in shared nod. Risk in quiet, textural build heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry. Avoids stock archetypes via specific grief details. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on healing, passing transformation test.</comment>
