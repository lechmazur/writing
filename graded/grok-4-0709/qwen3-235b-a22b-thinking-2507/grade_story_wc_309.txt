<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation from obsolescence to sacred seeking intensifies compellingly, with embodied emotions like trembling hands and contradictory impulses shown in her surrender to mist walking; interiority is concrete, rooted in grandmother's wisdom, culminating in an earned renunciation of envy with felt cost in the final smile. Reflection blocks anchor via the keystone cue and tilt her stance without excess. Flaws complicate choices authentically, avoiding stereotypes through her flawed mage identity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned motifs like frost and luminance to a resonant reconfiguration in the keystone's glow and her descent, with conceptual cost legible in rejecting automation; orientation anchors early with Elara on the spire. Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable pressure in the pulsing light and dropped pack, reweighting her stance. One meaningful deepening suffices, though causality feels more textural than strict linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The icebound spire constrains choices vividly, with tactile details like fracturing ice and mist curling ankles mirroring her internal thaw; sensory hierarchy reflects urgency, evolving causally to charge the final image of glow-clung skin. Micro-setting of the keystone and railing integrates into action, heightening atmosphere without stalling. Environment pressures her mist walking, making it indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming sacredness tightens through keystone placement, deepening via luminance bloom that forces stance crystallization under textural lens; agency in unstrapping and surrendering forecloses envy with felt cost in the dropped pack. One meaningful cadence shift suffices, with pressure coherent until resonant end. Coincidence of snowflake complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of sacred imperfection versus automated efficiency emerges organically from keystone restoration and snowflake dance, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in her pity for Engines; final image offers resonant, non-literal repricing of magic's value. Subtext in gestures like forehead press deepens complexity without confusion. Epiphany earned through struggle, eliciting honest aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person POV with perceptual bias in noticing frost and glyphs; voice texture is poetic and rhythmic, modulating with intensity in mist walking. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets. Some elision in reflections is taught and paid off at closure, but occasional register drift into abstract diction slightly jars under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density in images like refracting snowflake, varying rhythm naturally; however, paraphrase loops like repeated "luminance" emphasis in adjacent sentences dull momentum slightly without payoff. Syntax propels forward, but minor overwriting in peak beats with stacked modifiers triggers small deduction. Clarity holds at closure, with strong verbs dominating.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic obsolescence with keystone whimsy transforms trope of tech vs. art through specific motifs like mist walking, feeling inevitable in her final certainty; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically. Avoids stock echoes, committing to premise without hedging. Emotional specificity anchors universality.</comment>
