<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve lost knowledge is clear and intensifies through her careful choice to surrender a personal lesson, revealing a hierarchy of values with visible cost in the diary entry. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion in her steady voice and clutching of the diary, though contradictory impulses are more summarized than simultaneous. Kael's presence applies secondary pressure, forcing her to balance resourcefulness without crippling future work. The flaw of stock phrasing in her incantation slightly flattens peak emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure holds with because/therefore linkages from the time traveler's arrival to the archway's stabilization, culminating in a Decisive Change where the library is saved at the cost of Elara's unshared lesson. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first paragraph without debt. Closure lands on-page with felt conceptual cost in renegotiating time's debt, though the final symphony swell feels slightly expository. One meaningful tightening suffices for length, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore inside Mount Veridian is vividly anchored early with dust motes and endless shelves, constraining choices through seismic fractures and shifting corridors that mirror textual gaps. Sensory details like glowing spores and green luminescence are purposeful, reflecting Elara's urgency and biasing perception toward botanical and temporal elements. The setting evolves causally, with the mountain demanding a price that charges the final image. Micro-setting of the diary as a tool constrains her key action effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Under Causal lens, the dominant stake of rescuing the library tightens meaningfully when Elara realizes the mountain's price, narrowing options and forcing her to surrender a lesson with legible cost. Pressure coheres from temporal decay's urgency, driving agency through her resourceful incantation and writing. One deepening suffices, but coincidence of spore availability slightly complicates without resolving. Stakes feel visceral, though abstract library oblivion could be more concretely tested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge's cost emerges organically from Elara's surrender, resonating in the final image of the symphony and preserved lessons without moralizing. Subtext in unspoken sorrow and unshared truths invites reflection on humility, with ambiguity in what lesson she chose adding complexity. The core concept integrates through specific events like chanting in Root Tongue, eliciting an aftereffect of eternal vigilance. Ending offers a non-literal answer via Conceptual Repricing of time's debt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable in close third-person, with perceptual signature biased toward linguistic and botanical details, like noting cryptic marginalia. Voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, arcane prose that modulates with pressure, such as shortening under urgency. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances plot, with Kael's scoff revealing disbelief and Elara's response pursuing the goal. No head-hopping or elision issues; psychic distance shifts intentionally at the archway's flicker.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like dancing dust motes and pulsing luminescence without loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies naturally, with syntactic variety accelerating in action beats like sprinkling spores. Minor artifact in repetitive "unheard symphony" phrasing dulls momentum slightly but doesn't obscure closure. Opening anchors stakes; final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise of renegotiating with a mountain via botanical magic offers a fresh synthesis of temporal and linguistic elements, transforming fantasy tropes through Elara's specific resourcefulness. Risk-taking in conceptual cost heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the archway stabilization. Emotional specificity in surrendering a lesson avoids generics, though proximity to time-travel clichés is close without full subversion. Originality shines in the library of unlearned lessons as a non-obvious angle.</comment>
