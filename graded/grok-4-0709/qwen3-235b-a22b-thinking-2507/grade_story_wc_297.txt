<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to mend the covenant is clear and intensifies through embodied emotions like anxious elation, with contradictory impulses of hope and terror driving her blood sacrifice; interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing, and her final planting reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost in pain and roots' shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery of scars and roots to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final planting, with conceptual cost in her sacrifice; orientation anchors early in the glade, and closure lands on-page with the earth's hum and her step forward, though some elision feels slightly unmotivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cobalt glade at dusk is vividly specific with sensory details like violet streaks and root vibrations, constraining Elara's choices via binding roots and charging the final image of the planted clipping in golden light; micro-setting of scars mirrors her wounds, guiding the thematic healing without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mending the covenant tightens through the blood-linking and visions, with a meaningful deepening that reweights options via root conduits; under Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates via scar imagery, culminating in legible cost of her pain, though coincidence of the glade's shudder slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of reconciliation through scars emerges organically from images like the topiary clipping and blood-seeped soil, offering a resonant, non-literal answer in the final reconfiguration without moralizing; subtext in gestures of pressing and planting invites reflection on connection versus domination, with emotional honesty avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Elara's root-tethered senses, and prose texture of rhythmic, patterned diction heightens pressure; no dialogue, but purposeful compression in visions is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense with vivid metaphors like "roots slithered like serpents," advancing atmosphere, but occasional paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated scar-linking descriptions) and stacked figuratives in peak beats slightly dull momentum; rhythm varies naturally, and final line recharges motifs effectively without artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of futuristic intrusion with ancient covenant feels fresh, transforming eco-fantasy tropes through specific scar-linking method; risk in lyric density heightens stakes without gimmickry, as in the anxious elation tone modulating to charged poise at the end.</comment>
