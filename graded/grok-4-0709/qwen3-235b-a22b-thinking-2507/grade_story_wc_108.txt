<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and intensifies through her decoding and action, rooted in adaptive traits and phobia; interiority is concrete with embodied emotions like trembling certainty, showing contradictory impulses in her fear-triumph sob. The meaningful change—reclaiming agency—earns its cost through prior reflections tilting her stance. Flaws complicate choices authentically, as her aquaphobia layers irrationality without tidy resolution. The single-POV baseline holds with strong internal contradiction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Hybrid (Causal dominant early, shifting to Accumulative/Textural at end with pattern breaks in whispers and decoding reweighting stakes). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the dawn scene, where sending the video crystallizes her agency with felt emotional cost of facing betrayal's terror. Orientation anchors early in the library with Maya's cast, serving closure without disorientation debt. One meaningful deepening via decoding narrows options, holding under the lens without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars is vivid and purposeful, with skeletal shelves and moonlight pooling to mirror Maya's vulnerability and rebirth; sensory details like gritty cast and indigo sky are POV-filtered and evolve with dawn bleeding into rafters. Setting constrains her limping action and charges the final image of stars witnessing her storm-like strength. Micro-setting of the cast and seashell functions as environment, directly enabling decoding and closure. Tone tensions the betrayal concept through gritty, lived-in navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of exposing betrayal to weaponize vulnerability signals early and tightens once through decoding, forcing stance crystallization under Hybrid lens (Accumulative dominant at end); agency in filming and sending forecloses silence with visible cost of surging aquaphobia. Pressure coheres, with one deepening changing knowledge via cipher, narrowing options without coincidence resolving. Wants (safety) conflict with needs (truth), sharpening ethical calculus in the video moment. Escalation driven by protagonist agency, with unmistakable on-page cost in her hitched breath and trembling hands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability as power emerges organically from decoding the cast and sending evidence, with subtext in seashell whispers and smudged notes inviting reflection on betrayal's complexity. Final image of Maya smiling under fading stars offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting prior illusions without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete struggle, like the sob between terror and triumph. Thematic resonance arises from particulars, resisting tidy morals with plausible ambiguity in her lingering phobia.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature in Maya's biased noticing of water smears mocking her phobia; voice modulates rhythmically under pressure, like short sentences in decoding. Prose texture is distinct with purposeful compression in reflections, taught early and paid off at closure without elision issues. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; free indirect style is clean, with psychic distance shifting intentionally for emotional beats. Distinct idiom holds in internal voice, avoiding register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like the opening's vivid metaphors advancing atmosphere; clarity holds despite some paraphrase loops in reflection blocks, such as repeated betrayal articulations dulled by synonym churn ("shattered illusion" to "betrayal wasn’t careless"). Figurative language muddles slightly in peak beats, like mixed river grip and vise of fear, but doesn't obscure closure; information density is high, with sentences multitasking without major artifacts touching the end. Strong verbs and specific nouns dominate, though one template cadence run in the final paragraph ("She would rebuild... The cast would heal...") triggers minor deduction without harming propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stunt double betrayal with cipher decoding feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like the seashell half and child's cast; risk-taking in lyric reflections heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on aquaphobia and adaptation, committing to implications with authenticity. Emotional specificity avoids generics, with the decoding turn arising from character choice. No close echoes of famous scenes, and boldness in quiet closure elevates coherence.</comment>
