<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to sandpaper rough memories is clear and intensifies through her chef's gift, compelling her to subsume the pavilion's remorse; interiority is concrete with embodied emotions like tasting bitterness, showing contradictory impulses in drowning versus distilling. The final transformation earns endurance with felt cost, merging her scalding memory into communal grief. Strength lies in micro-choices under pressure, like breaking the coral shard, revealing value hierarchy without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through patterned images of water, sand, and remorse, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where regret thaws with conceptual cost of shared sorrow; orientation anchors early in the desert fortress post-rain. Closure lands on-page with the final sip dulling her wound, reweighting solitude to communal release. Minor slip in causal ellipsis when digging leads directly to the pavilion, but pattern holds without breaking lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The desert fortress after rain constrains choices, with ephemeral tidal pools mirroring the dream and guiding digging; sensory details like wet sandstone scent and cool sand underfoot are vivid, POV-filtered, and evolve causally. Atmosphere tensions brittle sturdiness, charging the final image of evaporating rain with possibility. Environment charges closure by supplying the pools as a recipe for release, meeting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of smoothing rough memories tightens through discovering the pavilion, deepening via subsuming remorse; under Accumulative lens, pattern break in boiling the shard reweights cost as shared relief. Agency in her choice to distill forecloses isolation with felt emotional price. Strength in moral calculus between drowning and tempering, but coincidence of rain revealing pools slightly complicates without fully resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of transforming remorse into tenderness emerges from images like coral thawing and broth reducing, inviting reflection on communal grief without tidy morals; subtext in silence and steam elicits honest aftereffect. Final image of clarity in water offers resonant, non-literal answer to memory's sharpness. Avoids overt symbolism, but epiphany feels slightly asserted in "not to forget, but to make memory tender."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in tasting memories and sensory bias toward scents and flavors; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, metaphorical syntax like "sand crumbling like stale bread." No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision in dream to waking is patterned and pays off at closure. Meets 9+ test with rhythmic control under pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sensory buildup like "salty and cold as glacier melt"; metaphors cohere without muddle, advancing atmosphere. Minor scaffold in repetitive "remorse" phrasing, but no loops touch closure; information propels to the broth-serving beat. Strength in final line's image recharging motifs, but slight overwriting in peak remorse flood dulls propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tasting memories with desert remorse vault transforms chef trope through specific tactile contagion and boiling ritual; emotional complexity in shared release feels inevitable. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Avoids stock metaphors, but premise echoes familiar redemption arcs without bolder subversion.</comment>
