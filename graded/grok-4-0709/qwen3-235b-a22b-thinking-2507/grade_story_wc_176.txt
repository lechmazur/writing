<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly from guilt to purposeful action, with embodied emotions like "snowmelt ardor" revealing contradictory impulses under pressure; the final renunciation of silence feels earned with visible emotional cost in her freezing tears. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, though minor repetition of traits like "technically gentle" slightly dilutes specificity. No second character, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Structure accumulates textural density through patterned images of ice and light, leading to a resonant reconfiguration in the final casting with felt emotional cost via tears and raw need; orientation anchors early in the sanctum under aurora. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens with motivated actions like weaving braids mirroring the card, though some reflective blocks border on excess without fully tilting present stance. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting preservation's premise with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the icebound sanctum and aurora constraining choices like gentle handling of fragile items and charging the final image of etched names in frost; sensory details are selective, POV-filtered, and evolve causally, such as snowmelt drips signaling thaw. Micro-setting of the rope and card functions as environment that directly shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving forgotten names signals early and deepens through the weaving sequence, narrowing options with the risk of shattering the card; under Accumulative/Textural lens, cadence shift at the aurora flare forces stance crystallization with legible emotional cost in tears. One meaningful intensification suffices, though coincidence of the flare slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness enabling preservation emerges organically from images like melting ice and illuminated names, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final bronze cast that reweights oblivion's cost without moralizing; subtext in gestures and silences adds complexity. Ending elicits emotional aftereffect through particulars, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct with poetic texture in syntax and rhythm, like "aurora light bleeding through frozen vaults," maintaining perceptual signature biased toward caster's precision; POV is stable third-person close, with purposeful compression taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue present, so irrelevant; elision of some actions heightens pressure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel beats, as in the economical weaving description; minor artifacts like repeated "technically gentle" and "snowmelt ardor" create slight loops without obscuring closure. Figurative language is controlled, avoiding muddle in peak moments like the light eruption.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lost wax casting with sonic preservation in a fantasy sanctum feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like perforated card mapping resonances; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, as in the bold final etching of names in frost.</comment>
