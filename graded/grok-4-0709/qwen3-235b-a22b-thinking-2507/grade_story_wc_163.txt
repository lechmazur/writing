<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation for belonging is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like recalibrating lights, revealing contradictory impulses of displacement versus deep immersion; interiority is concrete and embodied, avoiding stock phrasing except in minor echoes like "hollow ache." The final renunciation of frantic search feels earned with visible emotional cost in the shared exhale moment. Kael's brief presence applies subtle pressure, shifting status dynamics toward solidarity without overwriting. Quick test satisfied with impulses acting in scene and earned choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images of light and rhythm to a resonant reconfiguration in the final shared moment, with conceptual cost of reframed belonging legible on-page; orientation anchors who (Elara), where (underwater facility), and when (night toward sunrise) by ~120 words without debt. Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options with undeniable pressure, though one ellipsis in plankton agitation feels slightly undermotivated. Persistent constraint of dwindling reserves shapes tactics effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underwater facility is vividly anchored with sensory details like salt-crusted consoles and humming core, filtered through Elara's POV bias; environment constrains choices, such as the corroded grate snagging the feather, and charges the final image of jellyfish light on the dome. Micro-setting of the dome and lights evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Quick test met as recurring dome object charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of belonging tightens through deepening plankton distress and light recalibration, reweighting options under Accumulative/Textural lens with one meaningful cadence shift to serene jellyfish; agency in recalibration forecloses frantic search with felt emotional cost in the exhale. Pressure coheres but coincidence of Kael's appearance slightly complicates without fully resolving. Quick test met with agency-driven deepening and unmistakable cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of belonging through shared rhythms emerges organically from images like the feather and jellyfish, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in Elara's adrift state; subtext in silence and gesture culminates in non-literal resonant answer at the exhale, reweighting premise without statement. Emotional aftereffect is concrete via scene, avoiding sentimentality. Quick test satisfied with resonant final image reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature in Elara's astrological lens on currents; prose texture distinct in rhythmic syntax mirroring ocean pulse, with purposeful compression in reflective blocks anchored by cues like the feather. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision in Kael's sudden presence is taught via isolation motif and pays off at closure. Quick test met with distinct signature and rhythmic control, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the dirge hum and jellyfish dance; no major loops or artifacts, though one paraphrase in feather symbolism feels near-redundant but advances atmosphere. Clarity propels to closure without scaffolding; final line recharges motifs effectively. Quick test met with zero loops, dense propulsion, and clean figuratives in peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of landscape astrology in underwater setting transforms familiar isolation tropes through specific details like phosphorescent currents and burnt feather; risk in lyric introspection heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable at shared exhale. No close echoes of famous scenes; emotional specificity avoids generics. Quick test met with non-obvious synthesis and risk elevating coherence.</comment>
