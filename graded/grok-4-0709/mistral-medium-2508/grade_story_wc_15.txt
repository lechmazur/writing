<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies through his sleepwalking, rooted in frayed traits and haunting optimism that compel his mending of ruins; interiority is concrete via embodied metaphors like calloused hands and raspy voice, with contradictory impulses in his unknowing yet purposeful strides. The final renunciation of sleepwalking for awake steps earns stasis with felt cost in aching bones. Strength lies in micro-choices under pressure, like pressing the plate to stone, revealing values with trade-offs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned elisions and image density toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where the labyrinth becomes a loom, with conceptual cost in reweighted ruins; orientation anchors early in the tide pools and canyon. The sleepwalking path accumulates pressure via memory stitches, leading to a resonant shift at the Heart Chamber. Minor slip in mid-story ellipsis without stronger payoff, but closure lands with undeniable reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The red canyon labyrinth constrains choices, with grooves and paths mirroring Elias's weaving, charging the final winged shadow image; sensory details like brine scent and humming stone are selective, POV-biased, and evolve causally. Micro-setting of the illustration plate as tool integrates into action, guiding sleepwalking. Strength in how environment pressures the shift from dead ends to arches.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mending ruins tightens through sleepwalking intensification, deepening via the plate's glow and labyrinth shift, narrowing options with conceptual cost in unraveled paths; under Textural lens, cadence shifts reweight stakes at the Heart Chamber reversal. Agency in Elias's touch drives the reconfiguration, foreclosing old precedents. Minor abstraction in stakes early on slightly dilutes visceral feel.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of transforming loss into possibility emerges organically from images like bleeding ink and unfurling wings, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the mother's verse and winged shadow, reweighting ruins without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like tracing grooves invites reflection on broken precedents. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in poetic, frayed observations like "half-remembered hymn"; prose texture distinct in rhythmic metaphors and syntax that modulates with sleepwalking intensity. Patterned elision in dreamlike paths is taught early and pays off at closure. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; voice coherence elevates under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere via vivid images like "veins of red dust rose like embers"; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops, though occasional figurative stacking in mid-paths borders on muddle without harming clarity. Final line resolves with charged image, propulsion strong in sleepwalking beats. Minor scaffold in one paraphrase loop, but closure remains untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weaver archetype with sleepwalking labyrinth transforms tropes through specific optimism and memory-sewing, feeling inevitable at the loom revelation; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in mending ruins avoids generics. Proximity to mythic echoes is subverted meaningfully.</comment>
