<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to follow the pull and discover withheld truths is clear and intensifies through her sensory maps, compelling choices like pocketing the shard and stepping through the seam; interiority is concrete with embodied vibrations and scents, showing contradictory impulses in her thrill versus the weight. The man's brief presence applies secondary pressure, but relationships lack depth as a crucible. Flaws like her unflinching calm under stress feel too competent without visible struggle, slightly flattening emotional progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Structure accumulates textural density through patterned elisions and resonances like the shard's changes, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the ending where Liora becomes the map with conceptual cost of unspooling realities; orientation anchors early in the repair bay with Liora's senses. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens with motivated ellipses, but some turns like the seam's redirection feel elliptical without full linkage. The closure lands on-page with the universe bending, reweighting options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is vividly anchored with rusted girders, ozone, and groaning bones, filtering through Liora's sensory bias to constrain choices like tracing walls and pressing the lift; atmosphere builds tonal tension with sickly glows mirroring internal promise. Micro-setting of the shard and seam charges the final image, evolving causally. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, balancing urgency without cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering withheld truths tightens through one meaningful deepening when the shard changes and seam reappears, narrowing options under Accumulative/Textural lens with felt cost in the burning cold and thrill; agency in her choice to close eyes and expand inward drives the reconfiguration. Pressure coheres but lacks a sharper reversal, with coincidence in the intercom complicating without resolving. Moral calculus between resistance and weaving is present but oblique.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of truths woven across worlds emerges organically from images like the shard's knot and seam's pulse, inviting reflection on choice without tidy morals; subtext in silences and implications, like the man's warm voice, elicits emotional aftereffect of endless possibility. Final image offers resonant, non-literal repricing of reality's seams. Some ambiguity lingers meaningfully, but occasional overt statements like "the truth wasn’t a place, but a choice" border on directness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature in Liora's sensory lattice, modulating rhythm under pressure; purposeful compression in phrases like "cyclically spontaneous" teaches pattern and pays off at closure. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances plot, distinguishing voices with the man's warmth versus intercom distortion. No head-hopping or register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety with vivid, dense images like "sky bled violet," advancing atmosphere without loops; some overwriting in stacked metaphors during the seam's pulse slightly muddles clarity, but no major artifacts touch closure. Information density is high, with sentences multitasking; final line resolves by recharging the weaving motif. Minor template cadence in action sequences, like repeated "she" openings, drags momentum faintly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of multiverse weaving with sensory mapping transforms familiar tropes through specific details like the shard's wrong weight and cyclical pull, feeling inevitable; risk in lyric ellipses heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional complexity in thrill over fear avoids generics. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on parallel truths.</comment>
