<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation as a stubborn undertaker is clear and intensifies through his choice to climb the lighthouse, revealing contradictory impulses in his reluctance yet persistence; interiority is embodied in his cracked hands and bone-felt vibrations, with flaws complicating his endurance without safety-hedging. The final addition of his own name earns a meaningful renunciation with felt cost, foreclosing his isolation. Single-POV baseline holds without needing relationship bullets, as no second character appears on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern breaks in blurred ink and flickering anemones building to a cadence shift in the lens's flare and dead's rising; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where rest is reweighted as a signal with undeniable conceptual cost in Elias's self-inclusion. Orientation anchors who (Elias), where (library), and when (post-tide) by line 2, serving the quiet accumulation. Persistent constraint of the sea's currents shapes his swim and final image, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The underwater library and lighthouse settings are vivid and purposeful, with bioluminescent anemones and fractured dome constraining choices like Elias's jar-light work and kelp-choked climb; sensory details filter through his weary bias, mirroring internal sorrow in sagging shelves. The lens as recurring object charges the final image of crumbling warmth, satisfying 9+ test. Tone tensions the drowned quiet with ghostly blue, evolving causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of granting rest signals early and deepens through the lens's vibration forcing Elias's swim and revitalization, narrowing options with currents' insistence and a visible cost in his slipping boots and biting edges. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern break in the flare's stillness crystallizes stance with conceptual cost, driven by agency in his forehead press. One meaningful deepening suffices, with moral calculus between drowning and acknowledgment sharpening the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of rest as an acknowledged signal emerges organically from images like sinking dead and the lens's pulse, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in Elias's smile; subtext in silence and exhaled breath invites reflection on completion without sentimentality. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer reweighting the premise, satisfying 9+ test. Emotional aftereffect lingers through concrete particulars like the toy boat, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature in salt-cracked hands and bone vibrations, modulating rhythm from slow pulses to insistent currents without head-hopping; prose texture distinct in purposeful compression like "coughed up a piece of its own guilt." No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; elision in the dead's silent rising is taught early via quiet motifs and pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere like "cracked from salt and sorrow" without loops; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding template cadence in the climb's slipping boots. Figurative language is controlled, with no muddle in peak beats like the flare's stillness; zero scaffolds or artifacts touch closure, satisfying 9+ test. Minor overwriting in anemone pulse is purposeful and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of underwater undertaker and lighthouse lens transforms drowned-city trope through specific choices like bioluminescent jars and bone-felt calls, feeling inevitable in Elias's smile; risk in quiet, conceptual closure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in acknowledged dead avoids generics, with non-obvious angle on rest as signal. Proximity check clears, as no close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
