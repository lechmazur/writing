<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to rescue and ultimately destroy the promise is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like tracing symbols and lighting the match, revealing contradictory impulses of preservation and mercy with embodied emotion in his shaking breath. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, as seen in the "volcanic tenderness" erupting in his chest at climax. The single-POV focus excels in showing flaws complicating choices, with the resolution accepting their cost in Earned Stasis. Minor slip in over-articulated self-awareness mid-reflection slightly hedges emotional rawness but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned revelations and imagery, leading to a resonant reconfiguration in the final burning with clear conceptual cost of letting go. Orientation anchors early in the archive's scent and Elias's actions by ~50 words, serving closure without disorientation penalty. Causality holds via motivated ellipsis in reflections that tilt present stance, with one meaningful deepening at the pillar's message reweighting knowledge. Closure lands on-page as Decisive Change with felt cost in the whispered name and empty pockets, though a hairline redundancy in the ending wind imagery slightly dilutes propulsion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The archive setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like charred parchment and humming air reflecting Elias's regret and biasing perception toward forgotten texts. Environmental elements constrain choices, as the cracked pillar and tapestry fragment directly charge the final image by revealing the message and enabling the key's use. Micro-setting of the body (cold key on collarbone) and recurring objects like the ledger evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Tone tensions subtly with the womb-tomb metaphor, heightening thematic resonance at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of confronting the buried promise signals early and tightens once through the pillar's revelation, forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative/Textural lens with visible cost in burning the ledger. Pressure coheres via internal conflict between saving and destroying, with one meaningful deepening narrowing options at the infinity symbol. Agency in renunciation forecloses preservation path, though coincidence of the key fitting complicates without resolving. Moral calculus sharpens the peak choice, but stakes occasionally feel abstract until the match-strike climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of dangerous promises and merciful destruction emerges organically from images like the slashed self-portrait and burning ledger, inviting reflection on memory's volatility without tidy morals. Subtext in gestures like tracing symbols and whispering her name builds emotional honesty, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise non-literally. Core concept integrates through events, with ambiguity lingering in the smoke's question, avoiding sentimentality. Minor weakness in near-explicit statements like "Some promises were meant to burn" trends toward moralizing but is redeemed by particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward analytical intuition in noticing hidden geometries and whispers. Prose texture distinct in rhythmic, image-dense syntax that modulates with intensity, as in the accelerating cadence toward the match-lighting. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; free indirect style clean without filter stacks. Purposeful compression in reflections teaches pattern early and pays off at closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and character, as in the opening scent tying to regret without scaffold. Rhythm varies naturally, avoiding template cadence, though minor synonym loop in "burned... ashes... flames" appears once mid-story without harming closure. Figurative language controlled, with metaphors like "womb" and "volcanic tenderness" coherent and payoff-driven in peak beats. No artifacts obscure cause/effect, and final line resolves by recharging motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing arson-as-mercy with self-vandalism as map, feeling inevitable through particulars like the looped infinity hiding initials. Trope of forgotten archives transformed via volcanic tenderness tone, offering fresh angle on regret without gimmickry. Risk in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes organically, though proximity to classic redemption arcs slightly tempers ingenuity. Emotional specificity in the smoke's question avoids generics, committing to premise fully.</comment>
