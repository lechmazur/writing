<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The summoner's motivation to hush the prophecy is clear and rooted in her years of pursuit, intensifying through embodied actions like tracing water and unfolding the wing, with contradictory impulses shown in her lunge and subsequent acceptance of partial success. Interiority is concrete via sensory details like searing cold on her skin, avoiding stock phrasing, though emotions lean poetic rather than rawly contradictory in peak moments. The final renunciation of full victory earns stasis with felt cost in her exhaustion, visible in her resting on moss. Relationships and status dynamics are irrelevant as she's solitary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and cadence shifts, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the prophecy softens to a sigh, with conceptual cost legible in the world's softened edges and her earned rest. Orientation anchors who (summoner), where (brook), and when (night) by the first sentence, with no disorientation debt. Closure lands on-page with the origami wing's quiet return and her sleep, reweighting the stake without decisive physical change but through pattern break in the brook's resumption. One meaningful deepening suffices, though causality feels elliptical in the snap's resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven beside the quiet brook is vividly anchored with purposeful sensory details like rippling water and humming air, filtered through the summoner's bias and constraining her ritual actions. The setting evolves causally, shattering into shards during climax and resuming murmur at closure, mirroring her internal shift. A recurring object (origami wing) and environment (brook) charge the final image of rest, meeting the 9+ test by shaping choices like pressing the wing to water.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of hushing the prophecy signals early and tightens through textural density in the wing's unfolding and the snap, reweighting options with felt cost in her seared skin and solitude. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, one deepening via the brook's shattering forces stance crystallization in acceptance, with agency in her hush-weaving. No multiple reversals needed, but the resolution's softening feels slightly soft on visible trade-offs at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of mapping silence to hush unspoken fears emerges organically from images like the origami lattice and brook's murmur, inviting reflection through ambiguity in her partial success without direct statements. Subtext in silences and implications, like the wing's quiet return, elicits emotional aftereffect of tranquil relief. The final image of her rest offers a resonant, non-literal answer to unraveling via hush, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, sensory noticing like "terrestrially cosmic tension," modulating rhythm under pressure without head-hopping. Patterned elision in dream-flow is taught early and paid off at closure, maintaining legibility. Prose texture via syntax and diction reflects her mind, with no dialogue to evaluate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like the snap's sharp break, advancing atmosphere through multi-job sentences without major loops. Figurative language is controlled but dense in peak beats, occasionally muddling clarity, as in "serpent of soundless syllables," triggering a minor -0.3 for overwriting without harming closure. High information density and clear sequence support momentum, though some metaphors feel stacked.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of origami ritual, silence-mapping, and cosmic hush transforms prophecy tropes through specific, poetic details like the wing's reverse unfolding, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyrical structure heightens stakes via textural buildup without gimmickry, offering fresh angle on fear's weight. No close echoes of famous scenes, with authenticity in singular vision.</comment>
