<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly from the recurring numbers to her final renunciation, with embodied emotion in shaking hands and hitched breath; however, internal conflict feels slightly summarized rather than simultaneous in key beats, like the override moment, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The causal lens holds with strong because/therefore linkages from the notification to the file restoration, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where Lena accepts deletion with felt cost in the open door image; orientation anchors early in the archive, and one meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The social network archive setting constrains choices through firewalls and server hum, charging the final image with a heartbeat-like thrum; sensory details like ghost-light and vibrating patch are selective and POV-filtered, evolving causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering the brother's fate escalates causally through the numbers' trail, tightening to a meaningful deepening in the hologram encounter that narrows options and forces her sacrificial pull of files; cost is legible in her flagged termination, though coincidence in the patch's arrival slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of digital erasure and reclaimed memory emerges organically from the patch and lullaby motifs, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the rearranged numbers as a childhood home combination; subtext in whispers and echoes invites reflection without confusion, though some direct statements like "the archive keeps everything" border on assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in neural lace adjustments and number hauntings; prose texture is distinct in rhythmic pulses syncing with servers, and Elias's dialogue via patch carries subtext without direct mouth movement, advancing the plot naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in flickering terminals and shuddering archives; minor scaffold in repeated number listings feels patterned but pays off, and metaphors like "dying star" and "data graves" cohere without muddle, propelling to the silent ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise ingeniously synthesizes sci-fi archival mystery with personal loss, transforming cold case tropes through the vibrating patch and recursive echoes; risk in the open-ended deletion heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
