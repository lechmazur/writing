<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The characterization excels with Elias as a patchwork of stolen moments, his jealousy of past selves driving contradictory impulses that culminate in the earned renunciation of burning the scroll, revealing a hierarchy of values with visible cost in the empty grave and soaring release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the nonlinear shards build through patterned elision to a resonant reconfiguration in the burning and soaring, with conceptual cost legible in the reconfiguration of time as a wound; orientation anchors early via the scroll and cabin, though minor ambiguity in temporal shards slightly softens causality without breaking closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mountain ranger cabin and surrounding pines constrain choices, with wind and grave charging the final image of soaring; sensory details like creaking timber and fogged windowpane are selective and POV-biased, mirroring Elias's chronological confusion without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of distilling chaos into narrative tightens through the interaction with the younger self and the burning, forcing a stance crystallization with felt cost in the scream and ash; one meaningful deepening suffices, though coincidence in the younger self's appearance complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of feral nostalgia emerges organically through recurring glyphs and jealousy, culminating in a resonant, non-literal repricing of time and regret in the final "Soared," inviting reflection on narrative control without moralizing; subtext in silences and implications enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, rhythmic prose that modulates under pressure; dialogue like "You're early" / "You're late" carries subtext and advances the confrontation naturally, with no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density and propulsion with varied rhythm, concrete images like "ink shimmered... from the sheer weight of revision," and zero loops or artifacts; figurative language is controlled and payoff-driven, enhancing momentum without muddle in peak beats like the burning scream.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of time-loop jealousy and narrative distillation feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like the glyph shifts and empty grave; risk in nonlinear structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, cohering as a singular vision.</comment>
