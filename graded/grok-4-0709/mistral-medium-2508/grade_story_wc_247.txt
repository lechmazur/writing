<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias and Liora's motivations to reclaim forgotten songs are clear and rooted in their traits, intensifying through the confrontation; interiority shines in Elias's blurring fingers translating silence, revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. Liora's quiet charisma enables her lunge toward the threat, shifting status dynamics as she snarls, with their relationship forcing a joint stance that alters its state by the end. Emotions are embodied in shaking hands and the camera's changed weight, avoiding stock phrasing, though flaws feel more archetypal than deeply flawed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images of silence and light, with causality in motivated actions like signing and flashing leading to the tide's response; orientation anchors early in the harbor under moonlight. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with Charged Poise—the harbor alive, camera heavier with names—reweighting the stake of forgetting with felt cost in trembling notes and shaking hands. One meaningful deepening at the shadow's emergence narrows options, though ellipsis in the faceless thing's unraveling feels slightly soft.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The luminous harbor anchors vividly early, with sensory details like salt scent and fracturing moonlight reflecting POV bias and urgency; environment constrains choices, as waves rise in color to combat the shadow, charging the final image of a steady glow. Details evolve causally, mirroring internal states through action like the tide shifting, without static repetition. Micro-setting of the camera and hands functions as extension, guiding disruption with purposeful specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming forgotten songs signals early and deepens texturally through the shadow's emergence, forcing stance crystallization with one meaningful tightening as Elias signs a storm and Liora lunges; cost is legible in the wail's unraveling and shaking hands, reweighting options. Pressure coheres accumulatively via building silence patterns, with agency in their disruptive actions foreclosing the entity's hunger. Coincidence of the shadow complicates without resolving, though moral calculus feels implicit rather than sharply tested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming erased memories emerges organically from images like signing forgotten songs and the camera stealing light, culminating in a resonant final image of the world feeling wide enough to hold them, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext in gestures and silences, like the empty click as metronome, invites reflection on loss and hunger. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through complexity, as joyful sorrow layers in laughter like breaking glass.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close on Elias and Liora maintains stable distance, with perceptual signature in tracing air and framing through lens; voice texture distinct in poetic rhythm, modulating with intensity like blurring fingers. Dialogue natural and subtextual, Liora's murmurs pursuing goals with indirection, distinguishing her charisma. Patterned elision in lyric mode taught early and pays off at closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose dense and propulsive, with rhythmic variety in sentences like "waves rose in sudden, luminous peaks" advancing atmosphere without loops; metaphors coherent, like ink unraveling, heightening pressure. Clarity strong, though occasional overwriting in stacked images like sapphire/emerald/gold slightly muddles a peak beat. No artifacts touch closure, with high information density in the final sigh and heavier camera.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sign language mapping silence with a film-less camera disrupting forgetting feels inevitable, transforming tropes of ghosts and harbors through specific emotional truth in hunger as soundless note. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise with non-obvious reconfiguration of silence into living hum. Perspective memorable in thieves stealing back time, avoiding stock echoes.</comment>
