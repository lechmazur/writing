<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to understand living houses is clear and intensifies through her ritual, rooted in consistent traits like noticing creeping normality; interiority is concrete and embodied, with emotions shown through actions like arranging objects, though contradictory impulses are subtle rather than simultaneous. The final renunciation of the shard earns a credible endurance with felt cost, foreclosing possession while gaining insight. Relationships and status dynamics are irrelevant as she's the sole on-page character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and sensory density to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Liora reweights silence's role in aliveness, with conceptual cost legible in her softer steps and carried hush; orientation anchors who (Liora), where (bay dock), and when (spring, implied daytime) by line 3 without debt. One meaningful cadence shift at the voice's whisper and key press tightens the pattern effectively. Persistent constraint of the shard shapes the final image with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The quiet bay in spring anchors vividly with purposeful sensory details like sighing breeze and salt-stiff ribbon, filtered through Liora's bias; micro-setting of dock and displaced objects constrains her ritual choice and charges the final teacup tremble. Atmosphere supports the hushed tone, evolving causally as water stills and lights deepen to amber.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><grade>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of chasing houses' quiet life signals early and deepens through one meaningful cadence shift at the ritual, reweighting options with felt cost in leaving the shard; agency via renunciation forecloses keeping it, crystallizing stance. Pressure coheres via environmental and internal buildup without coincidence resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence as living essence emerges organically from images like the orris shard and breathing houses, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer at the ending where Liora carries the hush, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext in gestures and implications invites reflection on unnoticed profundity. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars like the teacup's tremble.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in noticing shifts like humming lights and fading scents; prose texture via rhythmic, purposeful syntax heightens the hushed blaze tone. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision of backstory anchors in present cues like the shard's find, tilting stance without excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally—short breaths in ritual, longer in reflections—advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold; metaphors like bay holding breath are coherent and voice-motivated. No artifacts obscure closure; final line resolves by recharging the hush motif cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of perfumery, displaced objects, and conceptual hush transforms familiar quiet-epiphany trope through specific, grounded choices like the orris ritual, feeling inevitable at the carried insight. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise's implications.</comment>
