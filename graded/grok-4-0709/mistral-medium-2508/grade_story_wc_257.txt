<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena's motivation rooted in grief drives concrete choices like shaping cranes instead of lilies, with embodied emotions shown through aching hands and hitched breath; interior contradiction emerges in her shift from coiling grief to releasing it, earning the final renunciation with visible cost in shared mourning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through motif density like cranes and vines, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where grief becomes a "folded promise" with conceptual cost of vulnerability; orientation anchors early in the observatory, and one meaningful cadence shift at the flower discovery tightens resonance without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The observatory's creaking dome and stone steps constrain choices, like placing cranes in cracks, charging the final image of swaying curtains and silver sky; sensory details filtered through Lena's grief-biased perception evolve causally, mirroring her internal blooming.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reshaping grief escalates through textural deepening at the artificial flower, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost of releasing memories; one meaningful intensification narrows options from wilting lilies to flying cranes, coherent under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief as shapable light emerges organically from particulars like the copper flower and inked vines, offering resonant ambiguity in the final cranes without moralizing; subtext in silences and implications, like the mentor's irony, reweights the premise with emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person POV remains stable with perceptual signature in grief-tinted details like trembling petals; voice texture distinct in rhythmic, ironic phrasing like "genuinely artificial," modulating under pressure without elision or head-hopping; dialogue absent, so not evaluated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose dense with propulsion in varied syntax and vivid images like "ink bleed into her skin like roots breaking stone," free of loops or artifacts; high information density advances atmosphere without overwriting, though some metaphors border on ornate in the closure shadows.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of jewelry-making and origami as grief vessels transforms familiar mourning tropes through specific motifs like coordinates and artificial blooms; risk in subdued, accumulative structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the shared cranes.</comment>
