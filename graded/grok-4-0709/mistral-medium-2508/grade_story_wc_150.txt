<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to restore through roots is clear and intensifies via micro-choices like planting the seed, with embodied emotions in his laughter and purposeful wandering; interiority is concrete, showing contradictory skepticism and faith without stock phrasing. The final endurance forecloses doubt with felt cost in the raw disbelief, earning stasis. Single-POV focus excels, but lacks a sharper internal contradiction acting simultaneously in a peak beat, capping high-band entry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with textured discoveries building to the sapling's emergence as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), reweighting faith with conceptual cost in resumed journeys; orientation anchors early in the valley return. Closure lands on-page with the cracked sundial and stirring orchard, cost felt in the trembling roots and Elias's raw laugh. Persistent root constraint shapes tactics, elevating the score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The catacomb-orchard setting is vivid and purposeful, with roots snaking bones constraining choices like following warmth; sensory details (damp earth, overripe figs) filter through Elias's bias, charging the final sapling image. Environment evolves causally, mirroring internal restoration without overt symbolism. Recurring sundial base as micro-setting constrains and charges closure, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring faith escalates accumulatively through discoveries, tightening with the seed planting and mural vibration, narrowing options to deeper pursuit; agency in renunciation of miracles yet embracing roots drives Charged Poise with felt cost in disbelief. One meaningful deepening suffices, but cost could be more viscerally embodied in the climax. Coherent pressure crystallizes stance without coincidence resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of rebuilding faith from interrupted journeys emerges organically through roots and bones, with subtext in the mural's invitation and sapling's prayer-like leaves; final image offers resonant, non-literal answer reweighting burial as beginning without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers in cautious enchantment, embracing ambiguity. Avoids sentimentality, but could deepen counter-readings for fuller complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with distinct perceptual signature in tactile roots and sweet air; rhythmic control varies syntax under pressure, like short sentences in the dream and laugh. Purposeful elision in dream pays off at closure without obscurity. Minimal dialogue fits policy, voice coherent and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere in lines like "roots pulsed faintly, as if breathing"; rhythm varies naturally, no loops or scaffold, strong verbs dominate. Figurative language (e.g., leaves like hands in prayer) is selective without muddle in peak beats. Minor register drift in abstract "journeys resumed" slightly dulls propulsion, but closure remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of diaspora return and catacomb restoration transforms tropes through specific root-bone interplay and purposeful wandering; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes organically. Emotional specificity in raw laugh avoids generics. Commits to premise without hedging, but could push bolder subversion for higher ingenuity.</comment>
