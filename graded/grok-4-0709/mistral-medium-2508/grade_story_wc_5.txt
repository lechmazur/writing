<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The alchemist's motivation to preserve starlight is clear and intensifies through embodied patience, with interiority concrete in her cracked fingers and curved spine, revealing contradictory impulses of hope amid isolation. The final realization and endurance foreclose easier paths with felt cost of ongoing solitude, earning Charged Poise. Strengths shine in micro-choices like pricking her thumb, which reveal values hierarchy without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered patterns and images to a Conceptual Repricing closure where she teaches light to stay, with conceptual cost of her life's dedication legible in the final image of snow on her shoulders. Orientation anchors early in the frostbitten soil and crater. One meaningful deepening suffices, as the ritual's cadence shift reweights the stake without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The subarctic crater and withered orchard are vivid and purposeful, constraining choices like salvaging the plate and supplying discards for patterns, while charging the final image of snow-covered embers. Sensory details filter through her bias, mirroring internal hope via gold leaf catching light. Micro-setting of her body and tools evolves causally, enhancing atmosphere without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sealing starlight to outlast the world's ending tightens through the ritual's deepening patterns, narrowing options with her blood as felt cost, under Accumulative lens. One cadence shift reweights the stake effectively, forcing stance crystallization in the realization. Strength in moral calculus between hurry and keeping, though coincidence of starlight availability slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of patience as teaching endurance emerges organically from images like folded starlight and the apple husk, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer that reweights preservation without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like tracing the plate invites reflection on hope's cost. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding sentimentality in her flawed, isolated persistence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Consistent third-person close POV with distinct perceptual signature in selective noticing of frost and gold, rhythmic control heightening pressure via syntax that breathes with her patience. No head-hopping; purposeful compression in lyric mode teaches patterns early and pays off at closure. Voice texture feels singular, modulating with intensity without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm and strong verbs, but occasional figurative density in peak beats like "breath curling like smoke" borders on muddle without full payoff, triggering minor deduction. No loops or scaffolds obscure closure; information advances atmosphere and character. Final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy with starlight preservation in an ending world feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like flash-paper and discarded husks that heighten stakes. Risk in lyric structure elevates coherence without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on hope's patience, committing fully without hedging.</comment>
