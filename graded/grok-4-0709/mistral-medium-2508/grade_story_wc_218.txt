<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is deeply rooted in her devotion to symbiosis, shown through embodied actions like wrapping wire despite pain, with contradictory impulses of defiance and acceptance culminating in an earned stasis at death; Tomas's curiosity adds relational pressure without dilution. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, as in her laugh at the prognosis revealing layered resilience. Flaws complicate choices authentically, with her heresy driving isolation yet fulfillment, and the final renunciation forecloses conventional rest with visible physical cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of pulsing pillars and wire-wrapped trees, leading to a resonant reconfiguration in the sapling's turn and Tomas's inheritance, with conceptual cost in Elira's death reweighting legacy. Orientation anchors early with Elira in the orchard, and the single-shard scene with brief reflection adheres to scope defaults. Closure lands on-page with the diary's final line and Tomas weaving, making before/after legible via devotion's endurance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The temple orchard setting is vivid and purposeful, with stone pillars breathing through roots and copper oxidation feeding trees, constraining Elira's choices like kneeling despite pain and charging the final image of the sapling's leaves brushing stone. Sensory details are selective, embodying urgency in creaks and chimes, filtered through her scholarly bias. Environment evolves causally, mirroring her internal symbiosis theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of fostering interspecies respect tightens through Elira's wire-wrapping amid opposition, deepening in her dialogue with Tomas to crystallize stance, with felt cost in her physical decline and relational heresy. Under Accumulative lens, pattern of bending reweights options at closure without needing multiple reversals. Agency in her renunciation of rest forecloses ease, though coincidence of dawn discovery slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of bending for respect emerges organically from wire-wrapped trees and Elira's devotion, culminating in the non-literal final line reweighting rigidity's cost without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like the sapling's tremble and Tomas's wrist-wrapping invites reflection on legacy's complexity. Emotional aftereffect is honest, avoiding sentimentality through her brazen calm amid pain.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Elira's tactile tracing of grooves, modulating rhythm under pain without head-hopping; brief shift to Tomas at end is sectioned cleanly under Track C. Voice texture is distinct in lyrical syntax like "pillars breathed," teaching patterned compression early and paying off at closure. Dialogue carries subtext, as in "teaching them to ask," advancing goals naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and character like "knees cracking like old timber" without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in action and breathing in reflection. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, enhancing propulsion without muddle in peak moments. No artifacts obscure closure, with strong verbs and specific nouns dominating.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of architectural symbiosis and terminal devotion transforms familiar legacy tropes through particular details like copper-fed blossoms, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise's implications. Emotional specificity avoids generics, though premise echoes archetypal mentor-passing-torch without full subversion.</comment>
