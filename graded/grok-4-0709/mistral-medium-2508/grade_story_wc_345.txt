<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivations are clear and rooted in Liora's selflessness, intensifying through her belief in Kael without demanding returns, as seen in her immediate trust when he says "I'm here to help." Interiority is concrete but leans poetic, with embodied emotions like pressing her palm to the earth revealing vulnerability. However, internal conflicts feel more summarized than simultaneous in scene, slightly limiting depth under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through deepening images and pattern breaks, like the bell's unfolding sound leading to collective growth, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final commitment to "We stay" carrying conceptual cost of ongoing effort. Orientation anchors early with Liora's arrival and the arches. Minor ellipsis in time jumps feels motivated but could tighten causality in transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating arches and butterfly garden is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices like Liora's tracing of cracks and charging the final image under the humming arches. Sensory details are selective, filtered through POV, with the soil's hum mirroring internal healing. Environment evolves causally, supporting theme without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of orchestrating collective effort tightens through one meaningful deepening as strangers arrive and repair, under the Accumulative lens, with agency in Liora's renunciation of escape for building. Cost is felt in the commitment but remains somewhat conceptual rather than visceral on-page. Pressure coheres but lacks a sharper reversal to narrow options more intensely.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of collective respite emerges organically from images like the bell and chalk messages, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights building over escaping, as in "Not a place to escape to, but a place to build." Subtext in Kael's flickering presence adds complexity without confusion. Avoids moralizing, embracing ambiguity in ghosts as family.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic noticing, like fruit pulsing with starlight, and rhythmic control heightens emotional beats. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and goal-driven, as in Kael's "You're early" evading thanks. No head-hopping or unwarranted certainty; elision in time feels patterned and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally, as in the bell's sound "unfolding like a bloom in reverse," advancing atmosphere without loops or artifacts. Strong verbs and specific images propel momentum; no overwriting or muddled metaphors in peaks. Final line resolves with charged image, recharging motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi ghost story with collective healing transforms tropes through specific details like chalked messages and humming arches, feeling inevitable in the commitment to stay. Risk in poetic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on respite as built, not found.</comment>
