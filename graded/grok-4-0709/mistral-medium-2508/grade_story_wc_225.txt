<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tutor's motivation is clear and intensifies through embodied regret, culminating in a meaningful renunciation of shame with felt cost in the heart-cracking laughter; interiority is concrete, with contradictory impulses shown in his fidgeting unraveling of the tapestry versus hesitation. The girl's secondary pressure forces a relational shift, but her late appearance limits crucible depth. Flaws like the merchant accusation feel summarized without immediate embodiment, slightly undercutting emotional contradiction in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elisions of chess metaphors and thunder, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the thawed village and reset board with conceptual cost of reframed scars; orientation anchors early with the exiled tutor at the village edge. Closure lands on-page with the tutor playing to stay, but some reflective blocks exceed BRR allowance without tilting present stance via micro-choices, creating minor orientation debt waived by payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The time-frozen village anchors vividly and constrains choices, with the platinum labyrinth charging the final image by absorbing regret and dimming post-forgiveness; sensory details like suspended laughter and humming veins reflect POV bias and evolve causally as the village exhales. Micro-setting of the tapestry and board integrates action, mirroring internal thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of self-forgiveness escalates via pattern breaks in unraveling threads, deepening to a cadence shift with visible cost in the heart's ice cracking; agency drives the reconfiguration through active weaving and playing. One meaningful tightening suffices, but coincidence of the girl's approach slightly complicates without fully resolving, trending mid-high.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness emerges organically from chess motifs and tapestry unraveling, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer via the reset board and laughter without stated moral; subtext in silence and implications enriches complexity. The final image reweights past mistakes as scars, not sins, inviting reflection through ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with rhythmic control in patterned diction like "woven hush" taught early and paid off; POV remains stable in close third, modulating with emotional intensity. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances the invitation to play, distinguishing characters without convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and high information in images like frayed threads whispering fragments; no major loops or artifacts, though some figurative density in peak beats borders on muddle without harming clarity. Final line resolves by recharging the board motif effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of chess exile and metaphorical labyrinth transforms redemption tropes through specific, inevitable details like the silver confession thread; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh angle on self-forgiveness feels organic and memorable.</comment>
