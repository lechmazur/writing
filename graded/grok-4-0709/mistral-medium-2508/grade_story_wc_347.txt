<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora's motivation as a reluctant caretaker is clear and intensifies through her choice to aid the girl, revealing contradictory impulses in her sharp instructions despite a lifetime of refusal; interiority is concrete, embodied in her handling of the nut and blueprint, with flaws like isolation complicating her endurance. The final renunciation of direct intervention earns stasis with felt cost in her ongoing burden, shown in the hut scene. Strength lies in micro-choices under pressure, like pressing the nut into dirt, foreclosing safer paths.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned elisions of backstory and imagery, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final impression-leaving and blueprint-tracing, with conceptual cost in the labyrinth's jammed state reweighted as fixable. Orientation anchors early in the orchard and labyrinth. Closure lands on-page with charged poise as Liora commits without looking back, though one more explicit tightening could elevate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting of the cliffside labyrinth with mechanical birds constrains choices, pressuring Liora's routes and timing; vivid, purposeful details like frost-stiffened joints and violet fruit mirror her internal burden, charging the final image of silver fingers creeping. Sensory hierarchy filters through her expertise, evolving causally with dusk. Recurring objects like nuts and blueprint function as micro-setting, directly shaping the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><grade>Under Textural lens, dominant stake of guiding without touching escalates through pattern break when Liora aids the girl directly, deepening cost in her pocketed last nut and commitment to fix the gears; one meaningful tightening suffices, with agency in renunciation foreclosing intervention. Cost is felt in her isolation, legible in the hut's flame against the blueprint. Coincidence of the girl's arrival complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of forgotten guidance and cursed burdens emerges organically from nuts, blueprint, and impressions, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the labyrinth's original purpose; subtext in silence and images like uneaten fruit reweights the premise. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer to isolation versus aid, repricing her role without statement. Strength in emotional aftereffect from graceless beauty, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, perceptual signature selective in mechanical details and fruit imagery, with rhythmic control in short sentences accelerating dusk pressure; patterned elision of backstory is taught early and pays off in closure. POV stable in close third, modulating distance intentionally for reflection. Brief dialogue is natural, subtextual, advancing her motivation shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, vivid images like "plump, deep violet things that glistened like oil on water" advancing atmosphere without loops; syntactic variety supports rhythm, especially in the final frost settling. No significant artifacts, though one mixed metaphor in "silver fingers creeping" is minor. Opening anchors voice, final line recharges motifs with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality in synthesizing cursed orchard with mechanical birds and nut-impressions as guidance, transforming maze tropes through Liora's offhand precision; fresh inflection in the blueprint's jammed gears repricing the labyrinth as fixable. Risk in quiet, textural structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable. Avoids derivatives, committing to premise with authentic vision.</comment>
