<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to prove whispers over shouts is rooted in his mother's legacy and embodied through the cork and scents, culminating in a meaningful endurance that forecloses doubt with the cost of his aching throat; interiority is concrete and contradictory, as seen in his silent exhaling versus Harkin's potential laughter. Harkin's shift adds relational pressure, revealing Elias's values in micro-choices like offering the cork. Minor slip in Harkin's quick softening feels slightly unearned, but it doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned vibrations and scents to a resonant reconfiguration where the lighthouse becomes an invitation, with conceptual cost in Harkin's recognition of lifelong shouting; orientation anchors early with the lighthouse at dawn. Closure lands on-page with Elias dreaming of gardens and knowing he's heard, a charged poise reweighting intentions. One meaningful cadence shift suffices, though causality is more implied than linked.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse at dawn constrains choices, its humming ribs and lantern room embodying vibrations that charge Elias's actions and the final image of dawn's ache; sensory details like salt and lavender are selective, POV-filtered, and evolve with events. Micro-setting of the cork and garden scents mirrors internal states without overt symbolism. Environment pressures the climax by facilitating the scent-based beckoning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving whispers escalates through accumulating vibrations and scents, tightening to boats turning and Harkin's wonder, with one deepening shift narrowing options via the cork's pulse; cost is felt in Elias's throat ache and Harkin's softened skepticism. Under textural lens, pattern break in the jasmine scent forces stance crystallization. Coincidence of boats turning complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of whispers traveling farther emerges organically from images of scents and vibrations, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in Harkin's recognition; final image of the humming lighthouse offers a resonant, non-literal answer to shouting versus listening. Subtext in silences and implications deepens complexity. Emotional aftereffect lingers through the garden's waiting soil.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV on Elias is stable, with perceptual signature in sensory biases like lavender and vibrations; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax that modulates with pressure. Dialogue is sparse but natural, subtextual in Harkin's softened query. Patterned elision of mechanics teaches and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like "intentions were not things you shouted" advancing atmosphere; no loops or artifacts obscure closure, though some metaphors like "knife screams" border on muddle without harming clarity. Information propels via images, with strong verbs and specificity. Final line resolves by recharging motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse with intention-vibrations and scent-beckoning transforms trope of silent power through specific details like the cork's pulse; risk in poetic ambiguity heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise feels inevitable in hindsight. Minor familiarity in mentor-apprentice dynamic, but personalized via whispers.</comment>
