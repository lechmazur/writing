<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora's motivation as a collector rooted in grief is concrete and drives her micro-choices, like scattering petals, revealing contradictory impulses of duty and empathy; the soul's lightness adds relational pressure effectively. Interiority is embodied, avoiding stock phrasing, with flaws like quiet certainty complicating her fearlessness. The final integration endures with felt cost, foreclosing traditional release. Strong but capped below 9.0 as contradictory impulses are shown but not simultaneous in peak scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned motifs like laughter and echoes, leading to resonant reconfiguration via integration with conceptual cost of reweighted grief; orientation anchors early in dawn-lit gorge. Closure lands on-page with the harp's harmonized notes and lighter satchel, reweighting the stake. One meaningful cadence shift suffices, but lacks a persistent constraint shaping tactics for higher band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like pale gold mist and wet earth filter through Liora's bias, constraining choices in the leaning cliffs; the gorge pressures the pursuit and charges the final laughter-filled echoes. Micro-setting of the harp and tooth evolve causally, mirroring internal healing. Environment charges the closure image, meeting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of soul integration signals early, tightening through harp interaction and petal scattering, deepening via laughter realization under textural lens; agency in pursuing and joking forecloses traditional collection with felt cost in the aching wholeness. One meaningful intensification suffices, driven by protagonist choice. Cost is legible but oblique, limiting to 8.3 without unmistakable on-page price in closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of healing grief through integrated joy emerges from particulars like broken laughter and petal scattering, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in lingering echoes; subtext in silence and implications enriches without confusion. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer to collection's sorrow, reweighting prior motifs. Meets 9+ test but capped at 8.8 as Q2 is below 9.0.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature in metaphorical noticing, like mist as held breath; voice modulates rhythmically under pressure without elision issues. Dialogue natural, subtextual, advancing integration with goal-driven indirection. Prose texture purposeful and lyric, teaching patterned diction early for legibility at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety, concise propulsion in lines like laughter splitting air; metaphors coherent without muddle, though some figurative density in peak beats borders overwriting but pays off in closure. Zero loops or scaffolds, strong verbs dominate. No artifacts touch closure, but minor register elevation in "spectral whispers" slightly jars POV lexicon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost collection with laughter integration feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific motifs like misaligned harp; risk in luminous ache heightens emotional stakes organically. Non-obvious angle on grief avoids generics, committing to premise without retreat. Strong but lacks bold structural risk for higher band.</comment>
