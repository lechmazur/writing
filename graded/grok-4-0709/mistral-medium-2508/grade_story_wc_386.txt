<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena's motivation to salvage meaning from wreckage is clear and intensifies through her careful weaving of truths, culminating in her own confrontation with her mother's memory; interiority is concrete with embodied contradictions, like her smile amid reproach, but the widow feels slightly secondary without deeper status dynamics pressuring Lena's choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of ice, light, and salvage to a resonant reconfiguration in the ending silence, with conceptual cost in Lena's ongoing burden; orientation anchors early in the glacier shrine, but minor elision in the widow's departure slightly softens the final cadence shift without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The glacier shrine is vividly specific, with pulsing blue veins and groaning ice constraining choices and charging the final image of sighing silence; sensory details like salt and diesel scents integrate into action, mirroring internal states and pressuring revelations without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of salvaging truth from grief deepens through the globe's visions, forcing stance crystallization in Lena's revelation to the widow; one meaningful tightening occurs as tears rearrange the flakes, with felt cost in sharpened grief, but coincidence in the globe's shivering slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of light through wreckage emerges organically from images like the cracked globe and etched names, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer in the final line about cracks letting light in; subtext in silences and implications avoids moralizing, inviting reflection on stubborn love without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Lena's ice-filtered noticing; voice texture is poetic yet controlled, with rhythmic modulation under pressure, and dialogue carries subtext like the widow's thick hope, advancing revelations without direct declaration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like the glacier's pulsing veins setting early cadence; no loops or artifacts, high information density in lines like "the dead didn’t shout; they seeped through cracks," and figurative language coheres without muddle, charging the closure image cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost whispering in a glacial shrine transforms tropes through specific details like the melted globe and kelp net, with risk in poetic compression heightening emotional stakes; the non-obvious angle on salvaging "parts worth saving" feels inevitable, avoiding stock metaphors.</comment>
