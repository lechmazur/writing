<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation as a shadow-laced peacekeeper is clear and intensifies toward intervention, with interiority embodied in his breath and fragment's pulse; contradictory impulses show in his hesitation versus the pull to act, culminating in the choice to step onto the ice. Strengths include concrete micro-choices like adjusting mirrors that reveal values with cost. A minor slip is the somewhat abstract "map empathy onto action" phrasing, bordering on diagnostic speak, but it doesn't derail the earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned visions and reflections leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final Charged Poise, with conceptual cost of shifting from observer to intervener legible in the mirrors shattering and his step forward. Orientation anchors early with lighthouse and Elias at the threshold. Closure lands on-page with felt reconfiguration, though one ellipsis in visions feels slightly unmotivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting of lighthouse orchard above ice floes is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like salt-cracked earth and groaning ice constraining Elias's choices and charging the final image of stepping forward. Micro-setting elements like mirrors and fragment integrate into action, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Environment evolves causally, with swaying trees and eager ice heightening atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of intervening in the girl's fate tightens through accumulating visions, deepening to a cadence shift in his decision, with agency in renunciation of passive role foreclosing observation's safety. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres with one meaningful intensification via fragment's pulse, making cost of action felt. The ice's hunger provides coherent pressure without resolution by coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of mapping empathy onto action emerges organically from visions and Elias's arc, with subtext in offerings and shadows inviting reflection on courage's isolation. Final image offers resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing, reweighting the premise via reconstituted moment. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature in selective noticing of frost and pulses, modulating rhythm under pressure like synced steps. Prose texture is distinct and purposeful, with patterned elision in visions taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue, so policy applies; no head-hopping or register drifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in breaths and groans for propulsion; metaphors like "trapped screams" are controlled without muddle. Minor scaffold in repetitive "groaned" for ice, but doesn't obscure closure. Information advances atmosphere and character, with strong verbs and specificity shining in the final step and shattering mirrors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of shadow-laced keeper, crystal visions, and ice offering feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific empathy-action calculus. Risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on intervention, coherent as singular vision.</comment>
