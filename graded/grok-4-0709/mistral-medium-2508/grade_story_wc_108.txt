<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena's motivation as a betrayed stunt double is clear and intensifies through embodied fear and adaptive choices, with contradictory impulses like her water phobia clashing with her resolve; the girl's secondary pressure forces a key micro-choice in deciphering the cast, earning the final renunciation of victimhood with felt emotional cost. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, though the girl's knowing eyes feel slightly archetypal. The hierarchy of values shines in the blood-on-shell moment, revealing vulnerability as a strength without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure anchors who (Lena), where (rusted library), and when (night after betrayal) by the first paragraph, with because/therefore linkages driving from encounter to decryption to ledger discovery; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise, as Lena walks out reweighted by proof, with conceptual cost of past erasure legible in the stars' brightness. One meaningful tightening suffices, but the girl's sudden appearance borders on coincidence that complicates without fully resolving. No orientation debt applies, as disorientation serves the tense atmosphere and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rusted library's sagging shelves and creaking floorboards are vivid and purposeful, constraining choices like climbing the groaning ladder; sensory details filter through Lena's urgency, with the stars mirroring her reconfiguration outside, charging the final image. Micro-setting of the shell and cast as tools evolves causally, heightening specificity without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Causal lens, the dominant stake of proving existence after betrayal tightens meaningfully through the shell's whisper and ledger find, narrowing options with agency in bleeding onto the shell; cost is felt in emotional betrayal and physical blood, forcing stance crystallization without coincidence resolving it. One deepening suffices, but the girl's role adds secondary pressure effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability as power emerges organically from betrayal and adaptive stunts, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights fear as a "current to ride" without moralizing; subtext in the shell's whispers and cast's message invites reflection on erasure. No thematic echo or explicit statements mar it, though the book's title mocks a bit overtly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stays stable and modest, with perceptual signature biased toward stunt-like assessments (e.g., tracing smudges like diagrams); dialogue is natural, subtextual, and goal-driven, distinguishing Lena's steady voice from the girl's knowing tilt. Rhythmic control holds under pressure, with no elision or head-hopping issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in tense moments like the shell's pulse, but occasional mixed metaphors (e.g., shelves as bones under stars) and a paraphrase loop in betrayal reflection slightly dull momentum; no major artifacts touch closure, and strong verbs propel the ladder climb effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes stunt double betrayal with a whispering shell and child's cast in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming identity tropes through specific adaptive choices; the blood-on-shell turn feels inevitable, heightening stakes without gimmickry, though the magical element echoes familiar artifacts modestly.</comment>
