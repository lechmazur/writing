<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to merge his split mind is clear and rooted in consistent traits like numbness from the Schism, intensifying to compel the high-stakes blood ritual; interiority is concrete with embodied emotions like the thrum of frustration, but some stock phrasing like "crushing, glorious all" edges toward therapy-speak in the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong causal linkage under the inferred Causal lens, with Veyra's arrival prompting the merge that reconfigures history; orientation anchors early in the dojo above the valley, and closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost in the pain-lanced skull, though the banners burning feel like a slight ellipsis without direct causation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful details like moss-slicked edges and storm-wracked valley reflect urgency and mirror internal schism; the floating dojo constrains choices by hovering amid rewriting history, charging the final image as it rises higher, though spatial choreography is somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of avoiding dissolution tightens meaningfully when Kael decides to merge despite pain, narrowing options under Causal lens pressure; cost is legible in the skull pain and sagging body, driving agency in the ritual, but the Emperor's threat remains somewhat abstract until the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming wholeness from schism emerges organically through the merge's reconfiguration, with subtext in jars and blood implying complementary opposites; the final image of defeating numbness offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV on Kael with distinct perceptual signature in tracing the jar and feeling thrums; dialogue carries subtext and advances plot naturally, like Veyra's "You idiot" with thick voice, but some register drift into elevated diction like "sound like tearing silk" feels slightly unmotivated under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and high density, with sentences advancing atmosphere like the dojo's hum, but overwriting in metaphors ("voice slicing through the pretense like a honed blade") creates minor muddle in peak beats; no major loops, but some scaffold in repetitive pulsing descriptions dulls momentum slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clone custody with mind-merging ritual feels inevitable, transforming sci-fi tropes through specific details like Schism's blade scar; risk-taking in the blood drip heightens stakes organically, especially in the climax merge, without gimmickry.</comment>
