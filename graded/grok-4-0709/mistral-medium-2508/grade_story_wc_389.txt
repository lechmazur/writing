<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to choose between dawn and dark is clear and intensifies through embodied contradictions, like shaking hands before sealing the crack; interiority is concrete, with emotions layered in unhinged laughter and hungry smiles, earning the final shift from listener to speaker with visible cost in the wailing voices' betrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned transmissions and storm imagery to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the portico's ripple and city's rise, with conceptual cost in Elias's transformation; orientation anchors early in the observatory, and causality holds via motivated choices like hurling the receiver, though one ellipsis in the storm's inhalation feels slightly soft.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory constrains choices, with the cobalt portico as a tactile lens-door that charges the final image by drinking the receiver and birthing the bruised dawn; sensory details like ozone taste and pulsing veins are selective, POV-biased, and evolve causally, mirroring Elias's internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of allegiance choice tightens under Accumulative/Textural lens through insistent voices and storm pressure, culminating in agency-driven escalation when Elias seals the crack and hurls the receiver, foreclosing darkness with felt cost in the silence and wails; one meaningful deepening suffices, though coincidence in the silhouette complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of self-assembled prophecy emerges organically from images like taffy-bent equations and shadow-woven light, resonating in the non-literal final image of dawn as scalpel without moralizing; subtext in silences and implications, like the reflection's words, invites ambiguity on power's cost, tying inextricably to Elias's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in ozone-tasting air and static hums, rhythmic prose modulating with pressure like short, jagged sentences at the laugh; purposeful compression in transmissions teaches pattern, paid off at closure without head-hopping; dialogue from voices and reflection carries subtext and advances plot naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in whispers to screams without loops or scaffold; metaphors like taffy-bent time are coherent and purposeful, propelling to the final line's unfolding future; no artifacts obscure closure, though one mixed vehicle in "wet and warm" voice slightly muddles but doesn't harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio prophecies and shadow cities transforms hermit-trope through specific, inevitable choices like soldering the crack, heightening stakes with bold risk in the portico-door premise; authenticity coheres in gritty-whimsical voice, with non-obvious reconfiguration feeling earned in hindsight.</comment>
