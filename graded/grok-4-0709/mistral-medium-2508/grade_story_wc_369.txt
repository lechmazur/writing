<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to map and absorb sorrows is consistent and intensifies through embodied actions like disassembling the sextant, revealing internal contradictions in his gentle handling of grief versus the tower's demands; emotions are embodied in his stinging hands and tears from pressure, not sadness, with micro-choices like humming to soothe the labyrinth showing value hierarchy; the endurance in passing sorrow along earns stasis with felt cost, as his hands feel lighter post-realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through layered images and reflections with coherent orientation by the first sentence (Elias in storm-ravaged labyrinth); causality is textural via motif accrual like the sextant's disassembly leading to realization, culminating in Conceptual Repricing where sorrow's weight is reconfigured and absorbed by trees with undeniable conceptual cost; one meaningful deepening suffices, but minor elision in how pieces "return" slightly softens traceability without breaking closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The stormlit tower and labyrinth are vividly specific, with stones breathing and moonlight pooling like silver, constraining Elias's choices as he patches walls and uses the arrow-slit window; sensory details like groaning stones and rattling shutters mirror internal sorrow, evolving causally with discoveries; the oaks as sentinels charge the final image, constraining the closure by absorbing broken things, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding quantified sorrow tightens through the sextant's disassembly, deepening via the mirror's reflection that forces stance crystallization on absorption versus measurement; under Textural lens, cadence shift in the humming and settling labyrinth reweights with felt cost in Elias's lighter hands; agency in renunciation is present, but escalation feels more accumulative than narrowing options sharply, sufficient for length yet not maximally intense.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of sorrow's absorption emerges organically from images like trees turning grief into growth and the sextant's dismantled pieces, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in whether unburdening is true relief; subtext in silences and implications, like the labyrinth's sighs, invites reflection on witnessing without watching; the final image of oaks heavy with stars offers resonant, non-literal repricing of measurement's limits, reweighting prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature in Elias's bias toward the labyrinth's breaths and sorrows, diction poetic yet character-bound like "whispered apologies"; rhythmic control in varying syntax heightens pressure during disassembly without obscurity; no dialogue, so policy skips; patterned elision in reflections is taught early and pays off at closure, meeting 9+ test with no slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid metaphors like "brass arms bent like a dying spider" advancing atmosphere and theme without loops; syntactic variety and rhythm breathe with beats, as in the exhaled breath during disassembly; minor figurative density in peak moments like the mirror reflection borders overwriting but pays off in clarity; zero artifacts touch closure, with high density in final lines.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of labyrinth keeper absorbing astronomical grief via trees transforms familiar relic tropes through specific, inevitable details like mapping dreams and moonlight healing; risk in lyric accumulations heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, feeling organic and singular; no derivative echoes, with emotional complexity in sorrow's quantification avoiding abstraction.</comment>
