<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and intensifies through her scars, which embody contradictory impulses of pain and vision, compelling her choices; the final transmutation of scars into bloom earns a meaningful change with felt cost. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, as seen when she presses the clipping to her weeping scar. Relationships as crucible shine in the future-self encounter, forcing a stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned imagery of scars and mazes, with density increasing toward the bridge-crossing turn; closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost in the blooming scar and sprouted leaf, reweighting past pains. Orientation anchors early in the cobalt glade at dusk. Persistent constraint of scars shapes tactics, but some elisions feel slightly unmotivated before the dais.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the cobalt glade's hues deepening to constrain Liora's path and charge the final image of the exhaling glade and blooming scar; sensory details like damp earth and crushed violets filter through her visionary bias, mirroring internal states. The maze as micro-setting evolves causally, pressuring choices without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uneclipsing the covenant tightens through the maze navigation and bridge run, deepening via scar-guided choices under Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is legible in the flaring pain transmuting to flight, foreclosing rooted shadows. Agency drives the intensification, but coincidence in the future-self appearance slightly complicates without fully resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of heeding scars and dreams emerges organically from images like the weeping sap and sprouted leaf, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final reconfiguration without moralizing; subtext in gestures and silences, as in future-Liora's sad smile, invites reflection on time's costs. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Liora's scar-focused noticing; voice texture is poetic and rhythmic, modulating with pressure, as in the glade's scream. Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot naturally, like the future-self's whisper reweighting the covenant. Patterned elision in visions is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and syntactic variety supporting beats, as in the spiraling paths; metaphors like "time’s greedy mouth" cohere without muddle. No major loops or artifacts, though some figurative density in the vision flash borders on overwriting without harming clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of scars as fate-looms and eclipsed covenants feels inevitable, transforming maze tropes through Liora's visionary specificity; risk in the future-self encounter heightens stakes organically. Fresh angle on time and dreams avoids stock, with emotional complexity grounding novelty.</comment>
