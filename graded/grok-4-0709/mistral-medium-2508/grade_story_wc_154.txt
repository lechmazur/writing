<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena's motivation as a translator of grief is clear and intensifies through embodied interiority, with contradictory impulses shown in her handling of the cast and coral; the final renunciation of passivity feels earned with felt cost in her singing ribs. The boy's secondary pressure forces a micro-choice that alters her stance. Backstory anchors via concrete cues like the coral, tilting present actions without excess.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images and reflections to a Charged Poise closure where the coral and cast reconfigure meaning with conceptual cost in the glowing embers; orientation anchors early in the atrium at dusk. One meaningful deepening occurs with the boy's arrival, shifting cadence without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight vividly filters through Lena's POV, with sensory details like fogging breath and ivy mirroring internal states; the environment constrains choices, charging the final image of mist and light pooling like a held note.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unknotting grief tightens through the boy's photo, forcing a deepening that reweights options under Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is legible in emotional forfeiture, as seen in the boy's hitched breath and Lena's singing ribs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of translating pain emerges organically from images like the coral and cast, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer where static becomes the sea answering; subtext in gestures and silences invites reflection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in Lena's shrewd innocence; lyrical voice modulates rhythm under pressure, with dialogue natural and subtext-driven, as in the boy's thin voice advancing the unknotting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, high information in lines like the coral mirroring archways; no loops or artifacts obscure clarity, though figurative density borders overwriting but pays off in closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of translator as grafter of meaning transforms familiar grief tropes through specific objects like the coral, with risk in lyrical compression heightening stakes organically; the non-obvious turn in holding rather than hiding feels inevitable.</comment>
