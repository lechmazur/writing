<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Qishti's frugal habits and empirical irony drive consistent motivations, culminating in a earned renunciation of pure science at the threshold hesitation, with embodied contradiction in his pulse quickening despite habitual caution; interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, though flaws could complicate choices more visibly in the final recognition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern of discovery builds through textured details to a Conceptual Repricing closure with conceptual cost in worldview shift, evident in the final smile and adjusted lens; orientation anchors early in palace halls, but ellipsis in decoding nights slightly softens causality without breaking lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like cracked mosaics and damp underground air filter through Qishti's POV, constraining choices at the warm tile and pulsing passage; the altar and schematics on walls charge the final image, mirroring internal reconfiguration without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding the unknown tightens through pattern break at the passage opening, reweighting options with faith's cost under textural lens; agency in stepping forward drives deepening, though coincidence of tile's warmth complicates without resolving, and cost feels more conceptual than visceral at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of devotion to the unseen emerges organically from images like shifting schematics and brighter stars, offering resonant non-literal answer in the final press against dark; subtext in silence and implication enriches without direct statement, embracing complexity in science-faith tension.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in measured steps and star-fixed gaze; prose texture modulates rhythm purposefully, teaching patterned elision in decoding process that pays off at closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in lines like "sandals whispering against cracked mosaic floors" advance atmosphere without loops, though occasional stacked metaphors in schematic descriptions risk muddle but resolve clearly; zero artifacts in closure beat, with varied syntax supporting momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ancient astronomy and encrypted faith transforms trope of hidden knowledge through Qishti's ironic thrill and covenant motif, feeling inevitable in hindsight; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, though premise echoes classic discovery tales without bolder subversion.</comment>
