<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The poet's motivation to alchemize pain into beauty is clear and intensifies through actions like singing louder against new wars, with embodied emotions in her humming bones and ink-veined hands; interior conflict shows in her shy persistence splitting stone, earning the stasis of resting in the shell's hum with the cost of eternal wakefulness. The ghost's accusation and her correction reveal status dynamics under pressure, altering his form into blooming starlight. Strengths lie in character-specific contradictions, like joy amid sorrow, without stock phrasing. A minor slip is the archetypal poet figure, but it doesn't undermine closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images of war-to-bloom motifs, with orientation anchored early in the shell and poet's insomnia; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise as the shell seals with the wind's title, repricing war into alchemy with conceptual cost of ongoing longing. One meaningful cadence shift tightens at the manual's creation and dissemination, holding the lens without contradiction. Strength in motif accumulation charging the final image; no orientation debt, as disorientation serves poetic payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell setting is vivid and purposeful, etched with war names and acoustics bending sound holy, constraining choices like niche placement and echoing lullabies; it charges the final image as a cocoon, with micro-details like calcium veins vibrating. Sensory hierarchy filters through the poet's bias, mirroring internal alchemy via tide and wind. Strength in environment shaping closure without static repetition; the shell's mouth yawning to the sea evolves causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of photosynthesizing pain into beauty escalates texturally through motif density, with one meaningful deepening when the ghost blooms and the manual is written, narrowing options to louder singing against new wars; cost is felt in the poet's unrested centuries and the ache passed to children. Agency in her corrections and humming drives reconfiguration under Accumulative/Textural lens. Strength in coherent pressure crystallizing stance without coincidence resolving; minor abstractness in stakes slightly softens peak tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of joy as sorrow's alchemy emerges organically from images like petals from weapons and poppies from rifles, culminating in a resonant final image of the shell's cocoon without stated moral, repricing war's premise with conceptual cost. Subtext in gestures like pressing the postcard and the ghost's unraveling invites reflection on endurance. Strength in complexity avoiding tidy morals, with the manual's title as non-literal answer reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, image-rich noticing, like wind carrying half-sung lullabies; rhythmic control heightens in humming vibrations without obscuring clarity. Dialogue is natural and subtextual, as in the ghost's accusation and her correction pursuing alchemy. Patterned elision in lyric mode is taught early and pays off at closure; no head-hopping or register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like "roots split stone" advancing atmosphere without loops; metaphors are coherent, such as gunpowder to pollen, serving momentum. Minor scaffold in occasional figurative stacking, like in the postcard's glow, but doesn't dull closure. Strength in high information density and clear syntax under poetic pressure; no artifacts touch the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing war-to-flower alchemy with a shyly unstoppable poet in a shell, transforming tropes through specific motifs like the manual eaten for hope; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable at the cocoon closure. Fresh angle on grief via photosynthesis avoids derivatives. Strength in bold, authentic vision with the wind's faithful title as non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
