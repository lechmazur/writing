<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Li Wei's motivation is deeply rooted in homesickness as a temporal ache, compelling his prophetic writings and final conducting gesture; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses between clinging to memories and embracing the present shown through his trembling fingers and the shell's fracture. The final renunciation of waiting for the courier earns stasis with felt cost of isolation, visible in the horizon's splintering. No stock phrasing mars the specificity, and micro-choices like pressing the brush harder reveal value hierarchies under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, layered memories build density toward a Charged Poise closure where Li Wei raises his hands to conduct, reconfiguring homesickness into agency with conceptual cost of foreclosed return; orientation anchors early in the spire and lake. One meaningful cadence shift at dawn's unzip suffices, with motivated ellipsis in reflections tilting stance. Minor ambiguity in lens dominance at midpoint slightly tempers, but closure holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The glass spire and frozen lake are vivid, purposeful micro-settings that constrain choices, with the ice's groaning mirroring internal fractures and charging the final conducting image; sensory details like humming glass and ice's taste are POV-biased and evolve causally. The nautilus shell functions as a recurring object that charges closure, meeting the 9+ test. No generic placeholders dilute the specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of temporal homesickness tightens through accumulative pressure of memories, culminating in a deepening cadence shift where the ice's song forces stance crystallization into conducting; one visible cost of emotional forfeiture is felt in the horizon's splintering, driving agency via renunciation. Coherent under Textural lens, but lacks a secondary accent for fuller escalation. The ending's Charged Poise reweights options unmistakably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of homesickness as a 'when' emerges organically from particulars like the sewing machine's chuk-chuk and shell's echo, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in silence's potential; subtext in the shell's fracture and ice's song offers resonant reconfiguration without statement. The final image of raised hands provides a non-literal answer to filling silence, reweighting memories. Earned through struggle, avoiding platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person POV with perceptual signature in selective, memory-tinged noticing, like the lake as cracked mirror; prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, lyric syntax that modulates with intensity, teaching patterned elision early via reflections. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; elision in backstory pays off at closure without obscurity. Rhythmic control heightens dawn's pressure cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax accelerating at the ice's groan and breathing in reflective beats; no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle, as metaphors like the horizon unzipping integrate seamlessly. High information density advances atmosphere and character per line, passing read-aloud test with natural rhythm. Opening anchors voice, final line resolves by charged image; zero artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle as memory-mapper transforms trope through specific childhood echoes and conducting motif, feeling inevitable at the hands-raising moment; risk in lyric accumulation heightens internal stakes without gimmickry. No derivative echoes, with authenticity in singular vision of temporal loss. Bold commitment to premise avoids hedging.</comment>
