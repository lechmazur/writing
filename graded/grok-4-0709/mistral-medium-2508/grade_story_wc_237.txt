<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lian's motivation to transform scars is clear and intensifies through embodied micro-choices, like pressing the quill to her pulse, revealing contradictory impulses under stress; the final renunciation of fear earns a meaningful change with visible cost in the scar's rewoven light, avoiding stock epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with patterned elision and motif accrual leading to resonant reconfiguration at the scar's softening; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with conceptual cost in refinement, though some reflective blocks slightly dilute causal linkage without breaking orientation, anchored early in the floating rock setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The floating rock platform constrains choices by its altitude and creaking wind, charging the final descent image with transformation; sensory details like ozone scent and steaming tea are selective, POV-filtered, and evolve causally, mirroring Lian's internal blooming without generic clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming scars tightens through one meaningful deepening when the rune fractures, narrowing options under storm pressure; agency drives the quill's shedding as endurance with felt cost in surrender, coherent under Accumulative lens without coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of blooming under stress emerges organically from scar motifs and rune imagery, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights transformation without moralizing; subtext in shedding and grandmother's superstition invites ambiguity, earning insight through concrete struggle like the quill's deliberate surrender.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Close third-person POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in rune-carving bias and stress-degraded thought; prose texture modulates rhythmically, teaching patterned diction early for lyric compression that pays off at closure without elision obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with rhythmic variety and concise advancement, free of loops or artifacts; sentences like "Her scars no longer ached. They sang." propel momentum and embody emotion, with final line recharging motifs through image without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of runes, scars, and storm breath transforms familiar transformation tropes through specific details like obsidian quill and frost lattice; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the crow's feather drop without gimmickry.</comment>
