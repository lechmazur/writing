<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to chase echoes is clear and intensifies through embodied interiority, culminating in the prism-hurling choice that forecloses his pursuit with felt cost; contradictory impulses shine in his reluctance amid the vision, as when the prism warms and answers, revealing self-deception rooted in his flaw of over-reliance on maternal teachings.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elisions and image density to a resonant reconfiguration in the soundless shatter and melting frost, with conceptual cost legible in Elias's unknotted shoulders; orientation anchors early in the arbor, and closure lands on-page with undeniable pressure, though one minor causality slip in the door creaking open without full motivation slightly softens the chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The quartz arbor and mist are vivid and purposeful, constraining choices like the prism's warmth and vision, while charging the final image of chiming branches; micro-setting of the frost patterns on the car window evolves causally, mirroring internal sorrow and enabling the face's emergence, with sensory details filtered through Elias's mystic bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving emotional absorption escalates through textural deepening in the vision and prism's response, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in the hurling act; one meaningful tightening suffices, as the frost's movement narrows options, though coincidence in the door opening slightly complicates without fully resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of echoes and truthful lies emerges organically from images like the refracted rainbows and melting frost, offering resonant ambiguity in the chiming laughter-or-debts without moralizing; the final image reweights the premise of absorption as reciprocal, eliciting emotional aftereffect through Elias's release, though one overt statement in "some proofs were better left unproven" borders on tidy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Elias's silence-measuring idiom, and rhythmic control heightens under pressure, as in ragged breaths during the vision; purposeful compression in mist-swallowing teaches the pattern, paying off at closure without head-hopping; no dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in fractured sentences during the vision for propulsion, and no loops or scaffold; figurative language like "skeleton of light" coheres without muddle, advancing atmosphere, though one mixed metaphor in "chord struck deep in the earth" slightly strains in the shatter moment without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mysticism with object-echoes transforms familiar haunting tropes through specific details like the frost-script language, feeling inevitable in the prism's answering hum; risk in the soundless shatter heightens stakes organically, though proximity to classic ghost-story echoes slightly tempers without full subversion.</comment>
