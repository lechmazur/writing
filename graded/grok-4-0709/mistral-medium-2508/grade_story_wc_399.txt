<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lysan's motivation to preserve ancient wisdom against the prophet's disruption is clear and intensifies through her consecration, with embodied emotion in her pulse-sensing and forehead-pressing; interiority is concrete and particular, showing contradictory impulses in her stubborn hold despite knowing it's temporary, as in "No. But I can hold it long enough."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and murmurs to a resonant reconfiguration in the parapet's song fading to a whisper, with conceptual cost in the fragile stillness; orientation anchors early with Lysan at the clearing's edge; closure lands on-page with earned stasis as she steps back "strangely whole," though one more explicit tightening could elevate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the murmuring pavilion's rippling silk and scents constraining Lysan's actions and charging the final image of sharpened edges; the kinetic parapet as micro-setting evolves causally, mirroring her internal resolve, as when it sings and settles like a second heartbeat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving whispers against prophetic fire escalates texturally through the parapet's shiver and song, deepening to force her endurance with felt cost in the temporary hold; agency in consecration narrows options under Accumulative lens, though coincidence of the voice complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom surviving in whispers over proclamations emerges organically from images like the half-mask and parapet's thrum, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer as "the desert would remember"; subtext in silences and peripheral awareness invites reflection on nuance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in sensory biases like mint scents and pulses; voice texture in rhythmic, poetic syntax heightens under pressure, as in the pavilion's sigh; dialogue is subtextual and goal-driven, pursuing preservation without direct declaration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the dunes' whisper threading through reeds; no loops or artifacts obscure, though occasional figurative stacking in scents borders overwriting without muddle; final line resolves with charged image, propelling momentum cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of desert mysticism and subtle resistance transforms trope of prophet vs. guardian through specific half-mask honesty and peripheral consecration; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the stubborn hum.</comment>
