<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dye master's motivation to understand the heart's pull is clear and intensifies through concrete actions like painting and journeying, rooted in embodied emotions such as the aching heart; interiority is character-specific, showing contradictory impulses in his reluctance yet compulsion to follow the map. However, the change feels slightly summarized at the end, with the heart "settling" without a sharper on-page micro-choice under peak pressure. The pivotal moment of painting in the village reveals values with visible cost, like arms burning, elevating the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images like the wing and dye, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the heart integrates with felt cost (wing dissolving, journey's exhaustion); orientation anchors early with the tea house on the floating rock. The cadence shift at the ending, with steam forming a question mark and silence as invitation, reweights the stake effectively. Minor ellipsis in the journey feels motivated but could tighten causality slightly more.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house and misty valley are vivid, sensory-rich, and constrain choices, like the suspension bridge marking the journey's start; the environment charges the final image with mist thickening, mirroring internal resolution. Details evolve causally, such as lanterns casting rainbows, integrating into action without stalling. The micro-setting of the wing and dyes functions as a recurring object that charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding story magnetization escalates through textural deepening, like the ink moving and village painting, narrowing options with costs like physical burn and wing loss; agency drives the journey and renunciation of telling stories himself. One meaningful tightening suffices, but coincidence of the guest's arrival slightly complicates without fully resolving. The ending's stance crystallization carries undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of stories filling human cracks emerges organically through images like the morphing ink and dissolving wing, culminating in a resonant final image of tea steam as a question mark without stated moral. Subtext in gestures, like villagers reaching for each other, invites reflection on being seen. The core concept integrates with theme via iridescent shifts, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, filtering through the dye master's bias, like noticing iridescence; voice texture is poetic and rhythmic, modulating with intensity. Dialogue is sparse but natural, subtext-rich, like the guest's "You're looking for the why." No elision issues, and syntax reflects the focalizer's state.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and character, like "the ink moved" propelling the turn; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops or artifacts. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, enhancing momentum without muddle in peak beats, such as the wing's color deepening. Final line resolves with resonant image, charging motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of donor heart with magical storytelling and iridescent caution feels fresh, transforming tropes through specific details like sun-trail map and morphing dye. Risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise. The village painting turn arises organically from character, not convenience.</comment>
