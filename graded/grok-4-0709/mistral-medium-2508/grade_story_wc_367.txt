<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora's motivation as the storm herald is clear and intensifies through her ritual ascent, rooted in traits like prophetic speech and laughter as a weapon, compelling her endurance with felt cost in the eternal bargain. Interiority is concrete, with embodied contradictions like her smile amid shadowed duty, shown in micro-choices such as twisting the wick despite the shadows' hunger. The single-POV focus excels in revealing hierarchy of values, but minor stock phrasing in emotional beats slightly dulls specificity at peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and cadence shifts, culminating in an Earned Stasis closure where Liora's descent forecloses escape from the routine with visible cost in her warm hands and counting hours. Orientation anchors early with the lighthouse and climb by ~50 words. Density increases meaningfully once via the light's flare and storm's laughter, reweighting the stake without causality breaks, though the prophetic line feels slightly unmotivated in hindsight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse under stars is vividly specific, with sensory details like salt-worn stone and ozone smell filtering through Liora's POV, constraining choices like her palm on the glass and wick adjustment. Atmosphere builds shadowed elation, mirroring her internal state, and the micro-setting of the lantern charges the final image of her descent. Environment evolves causally, affecting action without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of steering shadows to shape dawn signals early and deepens once through the light's flare, narrowing options under Accumulative/Textural lens with felt cost in her whispered denial and ongoing duty. Pressure coheres via storm's hunger, forcing stance crystallization in the wick's burn, though coincidence in the shadows' appearance slightly complicates without resolving. Agency in renunciation earns the quiet resolution with legible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of eternal duty amid ancient shadows emerges organically from images like the pulsing light and fraying silhouette, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in her cursed/blessed role. Subtext in laughter as weapon and prophetic slip invites reflection on shaping reality, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without statement. Emotional aftereffect lingers through particulars, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Liora's biased noticing of light's hue and storm's glee, modulating rhythm under pressure like shortened sentences during the flare. Voice texture is distinct and poetic, with purposeful compression in motifs; her spoken lines carry subtext and advance the ritual. No head-hopping or register drift, and elision in backstory pays off in present stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with vivid images like "sky split like a ripe fruit" advancing atmosphere without loops; syntactic variety supports rhythm, varying paragraph lengths for visual cadence. Minor scaffold in repetitive "she smiled" and "laughed" stems appears but doesn't obscure closure, and information density is high in peak beats. No major artifacts touch the ending, maintaining clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse as otherworldly guide for ancient entities, transformed through Liora's laughing heraldry and prophetic trait, feels inevitable with risk in ambiguous closure heightening stakes. Premise offers non-obvious angle on duty and shadows, committing fully without hedging, and emotional specificity avoids generics. Bold poetic structure coheres as singular vision.</comment>
