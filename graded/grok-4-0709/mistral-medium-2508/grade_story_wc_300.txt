<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The inspector's motivation to uncover the latent radiance is clear and intensifies through embodied choices, like trembling fingers on the shell, revealing contradictory impulses of fear and purpose; interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, with flaws like hesitation complicating the climax without safety-hedging. Emotions are embodied in her physical merging with the pearl, showing credible irrationality rooted in self-deception about the bunker's nature. The final renunciation of her old role earns stasis with felt cost, as she carries confessions forward.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, with pattern of shell confessions building density and breaking at the pearl's integration, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the world's walls dissolve with undeniable conceptual cost in the sky's light and her shining transformation. Orientation anchors who (inspector), where (cave beyond bunker), and when (present abandonment) by the first paragraph. Causality holds through textural escalation, with each shell's confession reweighting knowledge, culminating in an earned final image that reconfigures options without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The crystal caves are vividly specific, with pulsing bioluminescent veins mirroring the inspector's heartbeat and constraining her choices, like following the shell trail deeper; sensory details are selective and POV-biased, evolving causally as glow intensifies with confessions, charging the final image where walls thin into resonant hush. Atmosphere supports the theme through electric air and throbbing crystals, integrated into action without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of birthing radiance escalates accumulatively through shell confessions, with one meaningful deepening at the pearl's discovery forcing stance crystallization; agency in pressing the pearl to her forehead drives the reconfiguration, with felt cost in absorbing confessions that narrows her options from inspector to carrier. Under the textural lens, pressure coheres without coincidence resolving it, and the ethical calculus between keeping and giving sharpens the hesitation heartbeat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of dissolving walls between hearts emerges organically from confessions and pearl's unfolding light, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the bunker's womb metaphor and lingering wind-scattered hopes; subtext in shifting shell words invites reflection on abandoned hopes without confusion. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by repricing isolation as illusion, eliciting emotional aftereffect through her shining walk.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward electric air and pulsing crystals, modulating rhythmically under pressure like shortened sentences in hesitation; voice texture is distinct in poetic syntax and purposeful compression, teaching patterned elision in shell confessions that pays off at closure. No dialogue present, so not evaluated; no head-hopping or unwarranted certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and escalation without loops or scaffold, as in the seamless shift from shell to pearl; rhythm varies naturally, with strong verbs and specific nouns like "crunched over shattered quartz" propelling momentum. Figurative language is controlled, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the light unfolding inward; zero artifacts touch closure, though minor synonym proximity in "pulsing" and "throbbed" is hairline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes bunker abandonment with bioluminescent confessions in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming discovery tropes through specific pearl-as-method ingenuity that feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, as the resonant hush tone commits to conceptual integrity. Emotional specificity in carrying names avoids generics, with the final reconfiguration arising from prior particulars like etched fears.</comment>
