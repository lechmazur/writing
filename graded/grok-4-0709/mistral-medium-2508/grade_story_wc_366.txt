<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies through rituals like pocketing the sea glass, revealing internal conflict via embodied actions such as his throat tightening at the stone ring; interiority is concrete, with contradictory impulses shown in his burning letters then climbing the stairs. The meaningful endurance of staying forecloses isolation with felt cost, as the skiff rots. Flaws complicate choices authentically, like his long silence broken by writing a reply. No diagnostic labels mar the emotional progression, which layers realistically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elisions and motif accrual like letters and stones, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final image where Elias stays, with conceptual cost of forsaking departure made legible. Orientation anchors early with Elias guiding the skiff through mist. Closure lands on-page with the tower breathing and light persisting, a cadence shift reweighting stakes. One meaningful deepening suffices, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room constrains choices, pressuring Elias to climb and add stones, charging the final image of the humming spiral; sensory details like rust and old wax are selective, POV-filtered, and evolve with events. Atmosphere supports the luminescent ache tone through mist and glowing glass. Micro-setting of the room and stones affects action tactilely. Details mirror internal states subtly, without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><grade>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, dominant stake of isolation vs. connection tightens through letter accumulation and stone stacking, with a pattern break in Elias's reply and decision to stay, narrowing options with visible cost of the rotting skiff. Pressure coheres, forcing stance crystallization. One deepening via the blue glass reprise changes knowledge. Cost is unmistakable in the final reconfiguration.</grade></comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of safety through inherited light emerges organically from images like sea glass and stones, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the ghosts' invitations. Subtext in silences and implications, like the warm glass as a pulse, invites reflection. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer to loneliness, reweighting prior motifs without statement. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in precise, silent observations like oars dipping without ripple; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, image-dense syntax that modulates with intensity. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets. Purposeful compression in accumulative beats is taught early and pays off at closure. Diction fits the reticent focalizer, with no register drifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and character via images like "smooth as a held breath"; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops or template cadence. Figurative language is controlled, with no muddle in peak beats like the stone ring discovery. Clarity strong, with strong verbs and specific details propelling momentum. Minor scaffold in repetitive "held" metaphors slightly dulls but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story via anonymous letters and stone messages transforms lighthouse trope through Elias's reticence and the luminescent ache, feeling inevitable with risk in quiet, accumulative structure heightening stakes. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on survival and connection. Details particular to voice, like stacking stones as cipher. Commits fully without hedging.</comment>
