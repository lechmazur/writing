<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lien's motivation to mend the dimension through stitching is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in her traits as the last rememberer, with embodied emotions like her body humming lighter when grief lifts; interior conflict shows in her persistent failures and exhales under pressure, earning the final renunciation of her old existence with felt cost. The single-POV focus excels in concrete interiority without stock phrasing, though some abstractions like "shadow work" border on label-speak. No second character, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned motifs of stitching and tears, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lien steps through with conceptual cost of unraveling her stitches like a ladder; orientation anchors early in the observation deck with the birth log. Closure lands on-page with the dimension breathing and Lien staying, reweighting her as the "first" with undeniable pressure. One meaningful deepening suffices, though causality feels more poetic than strict linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship setting constrains choices vividly, with its bone hull creaking and gravity faltering to enable floating shadow work; sensory details like the console's shimmer and photograph's warmth are purposeful, mirroring Lien's internal states. The environment charges the final image, as the Eulogy remembers to fly before vanishing. Micro-setting of the needle and thread integrates action tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of opening the locked dimension signals early and deepens through failed stitches, narrowing options with snapped threads and surging gravity; under Accumulative/Textural lens, cadence shifts reweight sorrow into growth with felt cost of unraveling. Agency drives the push, foreclosing her isolation. One tightening suffices, but coincidence of reaching hands slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of mending sorrow into renewal emerges organically from stitching motifs and the tear's absence, culminating in a resonant final image of green grass and singing stars that reweights isolation without moralizing; subtext in the photograph's gap invites reflection on loss. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding sentimentality. The child's laugh offers a non-literal answer to humanity's end.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature in Lien's biased noticing of shimmers and warmth; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax that modulates with emotional intensity, like short sentences during the push. AI's sparse dialogue carries subtext and advances plot naturally. Patterned elision in lyric mode is taught early and pays off at closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and character through vivid images like "thread was her own breath, spun thin"; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops or scaffold, with strong verbs and specific nouns propelling momentum. No artifacts obscure closure, though some metaphors like "ladder of light" border on ornate. Final line resolves resonantly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of bone ship, shadow stitching, and dimensional mending transforms sci-fi tropes into a fresh angle on extinction and renewal, feeling inevitable through poetic particulars; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generics. Core premise commits fully without retreat.</comment>
