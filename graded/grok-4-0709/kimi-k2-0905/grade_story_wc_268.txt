<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The titan's motivation for precision over revenge drives consistent, regally unpretentious actions that culminate in a meaningful endurance of balance, with embodied traits like soft footfalls revealing values under pressure. The pretender's pride muffles caution, creating secondary pressure that forces the climax choice. Internal contradictions are subtle but present in the titan's merciful forgetting, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned marginalia and celestial pauses to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the glamour sunders with conceptual cost of unbalanced futures, held coherently without causality breaks. Orientation anchors early with the titan in the temple library. The single shard fits defaults, with one meaningful deepening at the seventh night paying off setups like the ink pellet.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ancient temple library lost in time is vividly specific, with leaning shelves and stone lions constraining the titan's stealthy movements and charging the final image of dust motes as a dissolving coronet. Sensory details like rust scent and parchment breath reflect POV bias and evolve causally, mirroring the graceful collapse. No orientation debt applied, as anchors are clear by 120 words.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring balance tightens through the seventh-night confrontation, with one meaningful deepening as the rune awakens, forcing stance crystallization under textural pressure without coincidence resolving it. Conceptual cost is felt in the pretender's absolute sundering and the titan's merciful forgetting. Agency via whispers and flicks drives escalation, narrowing options with visible price in the unraveling glamour.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth's drift emerges organically from images like dissolving ink and exhaling constellations, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final message without moralizing. Subtext in silent roars and swirling dust invites reflection on illusion's cost, with ambiguity in merciful history avoiding tidy binaries. The core concept integrates through the rune, reweighting the premise at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable and close, with perceptual signature in moonlit glow and storm scents biasing notices; voice texture is lyrical and consistent, modulating rhythm for pauses without head-hopping. Purposeful compression in celestial metaphors is taught early and pays off at closure. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision of direct confrontation heightens subtext without withholding known facts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and rhythmic control in phrases like "voice calm as closed winter" accelerating the sundering without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, charging the closure image of fading ink; no overwriting or scaffold, high information density in every line. Read-aloud flows naturally, with strong verbs and specific nouns dominating.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of diminutive titan and drift rune transforms fantasy tropes through poetic specificity, with risk in lyrical structure heightening stakes via graceful collapse. Core premise feels inevitable, with fresh inflections like merciful forgetting avoiding stock echoes. Authenticity coheres in voice and theme, committing to implications without hedging.</comment>
