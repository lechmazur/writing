<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern breaks like snow retreating and echoes weaving, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the city awakens with conceptual cost of alarming serenity. Orientation anchors early in the silver courtyard under snow. Closure lands on-page with felt cost in the terrifying lullaby of freedom, shaped by persistent echo constraints. One meaningful deepening suffices, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like frost-laced statues and faceted quartz refracting starlight mirror Lys's internal states and constrain choices, such as snow hissing to reveal mosaic tiles. The silver courtyard evolves causally, pressuring the climax by thawing into spring water. Micro-setting of the plinth and core charges the final image of blooming cereus. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency, with no generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of defying conformity tightens through untangling threads, forcing stance crystallization with visible cost as the contract burns but serenity alarms. Under Accumulative lens, pattern break in echoes scattering reweights options via agency in stepping into the reflection. One deepening narrows paths effectively, though secondary awakening stake braids tightly without dilution. Cost is unmistakable in the pelvic vibration and mercury tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of liberation's terrifying cost emerges from particulars like unravelled threads and hollow statues, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in chaste choice redirecting desire.

Emotional aftereffect lingers through honest complexity without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with distinct perceptual signature in poetic noticing, like echoes humming in moonlight, maintains distance under pressure.

Elision in reflections pays off at closure without head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
