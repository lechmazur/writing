<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to preserve forgotten names is clear and intensifies through her systematic sacrifices, culminating in her self-offering; interiority is embodied in foxglove-shaped heart and translucent silhouette, showing contradictory impulses of regret and duty without stock phrasing. The meaningful change—her becoming an extinct feeling—is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the chandelier payment scene. Flaws like abstract emotional labels are minor and don't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through resonant images and sacrifices to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Lira's self-sacrifice reweights preservation's cruelty with undeniable cost, evident in her silhouette offering and the bamboo tube's fall. Orientation anchors who (Lira), where (opal library), and when (twilight) by the first 120 words. Persistent constraint of the cracked tube shapes tactics, charging the final image without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The surreal setting of the opal library above clouds and museum of extinct feelings is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like echoing steps and fossilized sighs constraining choices; it charges the final image as the library rings with names. Micro-setting elements like the lectern and drawers supply resources that affect outcome, mirroring Lira's internal hollowing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving names signals early and deepens through memory sacrifices, forcing stance crystallization in self-offering; cost is unmistakable in her hollowing to a silhouette, under Accumulative lens. One meaningful intensification via the tuning fork and quill narrows options, with agency in renunciation foreclosing her existence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of sacrificial preservation emerges organically from images like glowing petals and sacrificed kiss, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final bamboo note teaching remembrance without stated moral. Subtext in silences and implications, like foxglove regret, invites reflection on memory's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, metaphorical noticing, like wisps as silk scarves; rhythmic control heightens pressure in sacrifice beats without elision issues. No dialogue, so policy applies; prose texture reflects Lira's gently systematic mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like echoing steps and spinning tube, advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though dense metaphors in peak beats occasionally border on muddle but pay off in closure. High information density in multi-job sentences, zero artifacts touching the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of surreal elements like extinct feelings museum and glass-orchid caretaker feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric structure heightening stakes through metaphorical sacrifices; transforms preservation trope via specific costs, coherent as singular vision without echoes.</comment>
