<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to preserve names is clear and intensifies through systematic sacrifices, revealing contradictory impulses of regret and duty in embodied ways, such as her foxglove heart closing; the final self-sacrifice is earned by prior memory payments, foreclosing her existence with visible cost in becoming a translucent silhouette.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through resonant images and deepenings, with orientation anchored early in the opal library; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration via Lira's self-offering, reweighting preservation's cost in the final choir of names, with undeniable emotional price in her weightless dissolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The surreal setting of the opal library above clouds and museum of extinct feelings is vivid and purposeful, constraining Lira's choices through drawers of emotions and the chandelier's demands; it charges the final image of the bulbs burning steady, with sensory details like fossilized sighs embodying the atmosphere and mirroring her hollowing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving names tightens through accumulating memory sacrifices, driven by Lira's agency in selecting and offering them; escalation reads as density increase in the chandelier's demands, culminating in her self-sacrifice with unmistakable cost, though a touch more explicit narrowing of options could elevate it further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of preservation's cruel cost emerges organically from Lira's sacrifices and the museum's marvels, with subtext in images like the cracked tube and foxglove regret; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by teaching the world through her echo, embracing complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct poetic texture in syntax and rhythm, teaching patterned elision early through metaphorical compression; perceptual signature filters details like wisps of melody through Lira's biased, resonant view, with no head-hopping and rhythmic control heightening pressure in the sacrifice sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm and high information density, weaving metaphors like "plume of audible light" without muddle; zero loops or scaffolds, though dense figuratives in peak beats risk overwriting, but they cohere purposefully to advance atmosphere and closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of surreal elements like extinct feelings and glass-orchids feels inevitable, transforming preservation tropes through Lira's systematic cruelty; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes via bold imagery, such as the bamboo tube's comet fall, creating a memorable, authentic vision without gimmickry.</comment>
