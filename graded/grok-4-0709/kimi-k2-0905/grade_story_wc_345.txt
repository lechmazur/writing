<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The altruistic ghost Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies through her chalk messages and balancing acts, compelling collective choices with felt cost in her farewell gust; interiority is concrete, embodied in her chilling dew and flickering form, revealing contradictory impulses between lingering and release. Colonists function as a collective secondary pressure, their relationships under scrutiny forcing trust-building that alters community state by the end. A key strength is the micro-choice in knocking fruit only when hands are ready, showing her values with visible cost. Flaws are minor, like slightly stock emotional summaries in doubt's crawl, but they don't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned shards of dawn messages and harvests, with legible transitions via recurring motifs like the bell and nebula, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara's tether loosens with conceptual cost in her blurring into violet. Orientation anchors early with the ghost drifting between twin suns and floating arches. Closure lands on-page with the final chalk message and pure bell note, reweighting survival as collective; a persistent constraint of her intangibility shapes tactics like frost-writing. Strength lies in the earned release, paying off early setups without redundancy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating rock arches and violet nebula is vividly specific, constraining choices like ladder chains and seed harvests, charging the final image of arches righting themselves. Sensory details, like condensation swirling and violet tasted on tongues, are purposeful and POV-filtered through Mara's ghostly perception. Atmosphere of brambled hope tensions the altruistic tone, evolving causally as arches tilt and roots re-graft. The watering bell as recurring object constrains actions, its clangs measuring rhythm and release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of orchestrating harvest to save orchards tightens via doubt's crawl and paradox of shared weight, with one meaningful deepening in Mara's proving through labor that forces stance crystallization under Accumulative lens. Agency in her balancing as counterweight forecloses isolation with felt cost in farewell. Pressure coheres, coincidence like breeze-rung bell complicates without resolving. Strength is the ethical calculus in trusting a ghost, visible in human ropes swaying, but stakes occasionally feel abstract before the chain formation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of collective trust and altruism emerges organically from chalk messages and shared labor, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in ghosts' fear despite smiles, culminating in a resonant final image of children feeling unexplainable trust. Subtext in brambled hope and violet anesthesia invites reflection on grief turning to harvest without sentimentality. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars like the pure bell note, reweighting premise without statement. Key moment is Kai's chalked line, offering non-literal answer to isolation versus family.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Omniscient POV is stable and apt for lyric mosaic, with perceptual signature in ghostly biases like chilling stars into arrows; no head-hopping, fits Track B. Voice texture is distinct, poetic with patterned elision in frost whispers and brambled clangs, modulating rhythm under pressure like swaying chains. Purposeful compression teaches pattern early, paying off at closure with iridescent pigment. No dialogue, so policy applies; prose as character reflects Mara's altruistic haze.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, every sentence advancing atmosphere via vivid images like curve of R shaped like butterfly wing; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in harvest chains and breathing in farewell. No loops or scaffolds, metaphors coherent and taught, like brambled hope recurring without muddle. Information propulsion shines in final line's resonant cadence, with strong verbs and specific nouns. Peak strength is iridescent message, integrating action without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost altruism on sci-fi orchard planet feels inevitable, transforming tropes like haunting into collective harvest via fresh angle of frost messages and nebula respite. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, with emotional specificity in brambled hope avoiding generics. Core premise commits to implications, like tether loosening only after unity. Standout is the paradox of one ladder tilting sky, a non-obvious inflection growing from particulars.</comment>
