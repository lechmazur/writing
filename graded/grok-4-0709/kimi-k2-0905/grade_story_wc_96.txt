<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The characterization of Lark shines through embodied, contradictory impulses during the molt and rebuilding, with micro-choices like sharing the coffee tin revealing values under pressure; Marin's status dynamics with Lark create a crucible that alters their relationship by the end. However, some traits feel archetypal, slightly limiting individuality in peak moments. The final stance as "co-conspirator of light" is earned via prior causality with visible relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and motifs toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the rebuilt library and fended-off guard, with Charged Poise in the final moonlit image carrying conceptual cost of ongoing resistance. Orientation anchors early in the rusted library under stars, and the single continuous scene with one meaningful deepening fits scope. Closure lands on-page with undeniable pressure, though one minor elision in the warden's off-page decision slightly softens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars constrains choices, supplying resources like shelves and books that directly shape the rebuilding action and charge the final image of cranes in dictionaries. Sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, with iron dust and heat licks mirroring internal reinvention. Micro-setting of the coffee tin and stove evolves causally, heightening atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of forging beauty from anarchy tightens through the collaborative rebuilding and confrontation with Rourke, with one meaningful deepening via burning past selves that narrows options and forces stance crystallization under the Textural lens. Cost is felt in the trembling new skin and relational risk, though coincidence in Rourke's retreat slightly complicates without fully resolving. Agency in renunciation of old selves drives escalation with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of blooming resistance emerges organically from images like molting and paper cranes, offering a resonant, non-literal answer in the final reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in gestures and silences, such as fingers brushing over Neruda, invites reflection on reinvention amid anarchy. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding sentimentality, though one overt mantra echo slightly flattens resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV stays stable with Lark's perceptual signature in poetic, biased noticing like "words arrive jagged," and rhythmic control heightens under pressure without head-hopping. Dialogue feels natural, subtext-laden, and distinct, advancing plot via lines like "Can poems stop bulldozers?" Purposeful compression in lyric mode is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, propulsion-driven sentences like "flames bloom green, luminous fracture against iron," varying rhythm naturally without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, accelerating momentum in peak beats. Zero scaffold or redundancy, with strong verbs and specific details advancing atmosphere flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of monthly molting as resistance synthesizes poetic reinvention with prison anarchy in a non-obvious way, feeling inevitable through specifics like the false-bottom tin. Risk-taking in metaphorical structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes like shedding skin into fresh emotional truth. One fresh inflection in the collaborative shadows elevates ingenuity.</comment>
