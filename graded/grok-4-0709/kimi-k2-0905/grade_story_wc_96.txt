<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The characterization of Lark excels with embodied molting that reveals contradictory impulses, such as cynicism shedding into hope, culminating in an earned shift to "lantern-bearer" with visible cost in the ashes. Marin's relationship acts as a crucible, pressuring collaborative choices that alter their dynamic by the end. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, though some emotional progression leans poetic over raw contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images like molting and rebuilding, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final silver-rinsed scene with conceptual cost of perpetual reinvention. Orientation anchors early in the rusted library under stars, with one meaningful deepening via the stove-feeding ritual. Closure lands on-page with felt cost, though some elisions feel more poetic than causally tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars vividly anchors atmosphere, with sensory details like iron dust and punctured ceiling constraining choices, such as hiding in stacks or rebuilding shelves. The setting charges the final image of moon-rinsed beams, mirroring internal blooming. Specificity is purposeful, evolving causally from chaos to order without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving the library against entropy escalates through one meaningful deepening when they feed old selves to the stove, narrowing options and forcing agency in deceiving Rourke. Cost is legible in the foreclosed solitary pods, with pressure cohering under the textural lens. Coincidence of Marin's presence complicates but doesn't resolve, though stakes occasionally feel more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of blooming resistance emerges organically from particulars like molting and paper cranes, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final image of gates cracking without moralizing. Subtext in gestures, like brushing fingers over Neruda, invites reflection on reinvention's complexity. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through ambiguous costs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person voice maintains a distinct poetic texture with rhythmic control, perceptual bias in Lark's worldview, and purposeful compression that pays off at closure. Dialogue is natural, subtext-laden, and advances plot, distinguishing characters through idiom like Lark's murmurs versus Marin's lullabies. No head-hopping or register drift, with syntax reflecting emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid metaphors like "pages scatter like startled doves" advancing atmosphere and momentum without loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies naturally, sentences propel through selective imagery, and figurative language coheres without muddle in peak beats like the stove scene. Zero artifacts touch closure, though some density borders overwriting in descriptive runs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the molting poet's monthly reinvention and coffee-tin husks, synthesizing familiar prison tropes into a fresh angle on resistance with risk-taking poetic structure that heightens stakes. Core premise feels inevitable, transforming anarchy into beauty through specific details like micro-poems on cranes. No echoes of famous scenes, with bold vision cohering singularly.</comment>
