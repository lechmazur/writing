<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation evolves compellingly from professional duty to personal reckoning, with embodied emotions like the "stone in her throat" revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. Interiority is concrete and particular, culminating in an earned transformation that forecloses her autonomy with visible cost. Flaws, such as unwitting inheritance, complicate choices without hedging, driving inevitable immersion into the legacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered discoveries with motivated ellipsis, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Mira becomes the echo, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost in the looping final image. Orientation anchors early via the corridor and role, with one meaningful deepening in the tunnel descent. Minor redundancy in diary repetition slightly softens causality but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ruined university setting is vividly specific, with mossy corridors and ivy constraining Mira's path and charging the final negative strip image. Sensory details, filtered through her perceptive bias, evolve causally, mirroring internal dissolution. Environment pressures choices, like the hidden tunnel enabling revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling legacy tightens through deepening discoveries, forcing stance crystallization in the transformation with felt cost of eternal looping. Agency manifests in persistent pursuit, narrowing options under textural pressure without coincidence resolving. One meaningful intensification suffices, though secondary echoes feel slightly diffuse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of inherited memory emerges organically from negatives and echoes, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the burden without moralizing. Subtext in inverted images invites ambiguity, eliciting lingering reflection on forgetting. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality through complex, non-literal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-specific, with perceptual signature in acoustic sensitivities heightening immersion. Prose texture is distinct, rhythmic, and voice-motivated, using patterned elision like reversed aging to pay off at closure. No head-hopping or elision obscures legibility under the textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, propulsion-driven sentences, varying rhythm to match descent's cadence without loops or scaffold. Figurative language, like "laugher a hollow skull," integrates seamlessly, advancing atmosphere and theme. Zero artifacts in peak beats, with final line recharging motifs impeccably.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of echo mapping and photographic legacy transforms familiar abandonment tropes into a bold, inevitable premise, with risk-taking in surreal inversion heightening stakes. Fresh angle on memory feels organic, committing fully without retreat. The building-as-camera concept offers non-obvious ingenuity, grounded in specific details.</comment>
