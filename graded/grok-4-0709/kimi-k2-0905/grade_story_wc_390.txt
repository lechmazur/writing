<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mireya's motivation to protect the artifact is clear and rooted in her traits as a logically emotional engineer, with embodied emotions shown through her syncing heartbeat and tears; internal conflict shines in the calculus of saving the bone versus the town, leading to an earned third path with visible cost in the key's wear and her emotional release. Strengths include concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like changing the bowing pattern, revealing value hierarchy. No major flaws, but secondary characters are absent, limiting relationship crucibles.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through sonic patterns and sensory density to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where shadows soften into forgiven forms, with felt cost in the marina's near-shatter and Mireya's tears; orientation anchors early with the pier and sunset. One meaningful deepening occurs via the third vibrational path, sufficient for length. Minor slip in ellipsis of shadow resolution, but causality holds without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is vividly specific with sensory details like knocking ice and humming pilings, constraining choices as slabs calve during the climax; atmosphere of fleshly ethereal tone mirrors internal states, charging the final image of stars spiraling like the Echo. Environment pressures tactics, such as pressing the key to the pier for conduction. Exceptional integration without generic clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of protecting the artifact tightens meaningfully when Mireya weaves a third path, deepening pressure under the Accumulative lens by inviting shadows to listen, with legible cost in the hot key and calving ice; agency via adaptation forecloses destruction paths. Coherent escalation forces stance crystallization without coincidence resolving. Strong but lacks a secondary accent for higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of sonic absolution and teaching darkness to listen emerges organically from images like the whale call frequency and glowing fissures, offering a resonant, non-literal answer in the final spiral of stars without moralizing; subtext in shadows' hunger and ice's memory enriches complexity. Emotional aftereffect lingers through Mireya's tears tasting of salt and whale song. Avoids common failures like thematic statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in sonic-focused noticing, like detecting micro-shrieks; voice texture is lyrical and rhythmic, modulating with pressure through syntax like "fissures glowing with the same amber." Purposeful compression in vibrational descriptions is taught early and pays off at closure. No dialogue, so policy applies; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purposeful figurative language like "sunset bled across the horizon like a wound healing in reverse," varying rhythm and avoiding loops; high information density advances atmosphere and stakes without scaffold. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors during bowing, but clarity holds at closure. Read-aloud flows naturally with syntactic variety.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lighthouse engineering with sonic mythology feels inevitable, transforming tropes like shadows into forgiven townsfolk through vibrational matching; risk-taking in lyrical structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh angle on mercy via whale bone and ice memory avoids derivatives. Bold commitment to premise elevates ingenuity.</comment>
