<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The guardian's motivation to befriend uncertainty is clear and rooted in dimensional homesickness, intensifying through embodied actions like licking the sundial, which reveals contradictory impulses in scene; interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions embodied in paw-to-hand shifts and frost becoming bones. However, some stock surreal phrasing slightly dilutes specificity, though flaws don't touch the resonant closure of becoming the garden.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and cadence shifts, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the guardian dissolves into the garden with conceptual cost of exile reframed as arrival; orientation anchors early in the frozen garden at night, with deliberate mist disorientation paying off at closure. One meaningful deepening suffices, with the pendant's cracking as a pattern break reweighting knowledge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The frozen garden in mist is vividly sensory and purposeful, with iron-tasting fog and frostbitten topiaries constraining choices like pressing the rose or licking the sundial; it charges the final image of becoming the rose and mist, evolving causally to mirror internal states without overt symbolism. Micro-setting of body and pendant integrates tactile navigation, heightening atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of befriending uncertainty signals early and deepens texturally through density increases like the pendant's pulsing and sigil rotation, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in dissolution; one meaningful cadence shift at the pendant cracking narrows options, though coincidence in mist thickening complicates without resolving. Agency via endurance forecloses paths with conceptual price legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of waiting as attendance emerges organically from images like the frozen rose preserving without opening, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer at closure where uncertainty becomes friendship; subtext in silences and implications avoids moralizing, with purposeful ambiguity inviting reflection on homesickness. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in foggy lucidity, syntax rhythmic and voice-motivated in patterned elision like "interiorizing exteriors"; purposeful compression teaches pattern early, paying off at closure without head-hopping. Prose texture modulates with intensity, carrying subtext in whispered lines to uncertainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, high information in metaphors like breath as suspended commas advancing atmosphere; no loops or scaffolds, though dense figuratives in peak beats risk muddle but remain coherent and taught. Final line resolves by recharging motifs without artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of feral guardian and dimensional homesickness transforms surreal tropes through specific images like the compass rose pointing nowhere, feeling inevitable with risk-taking in lyric structure heightening stakes; non-obvious angle on uncertainty avoids generics, committing fully without hedging.</comment>
