<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The timekeeper's motivation to rediscover time is clear and intensifies through concrete, embodied choices like rubbing the urn fragment and collecting tags, revealing internal contradictions between his past ledger-keeping and current timeless hush. Interiority is character-specific and embodied, with emotions like the "heart knocking with anticipated mysteries" showing contradictory impulses under pressure without stock phrasing. The final renunciation of numerical measurement for sensory exchange feels earned by prior causality, foreclosing his old path with a felt conceptual cost in the dusk dispersal. Voice distinction holds in the single-POV focus, with no secondary characters demanding status dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increasing through layered images like dust motes and price tags, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing closure where time's texture is repriced as granular dust with undeniable conceptual cost in the final exchange. Orientation anchors who (timekeeper), where (emerald silo), and when (dawn after numbers change) by ~50 words, waiving any penalty. Structure fits defaults with one continuous shard-like scene at the silo, building to a resonant reconfiguration without causality breaks. Minor redundancy in tag-reading beats slightly flattens progression but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The emerald silo setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like rusted gauges and drifting dust motes filtered through the timekeeper's biased perception, constraining choices like climbing the ladder for horizon views. Atmosphere evolves causally from dawn hush to dusk dispersal, mirroring internal timelessness with tactile navigation that charges the final cairn-building image. Micro-setting of the urn fragment and tags functions as environment, directly shaping the closure's conceptual repricing. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, with no inconsistencies.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding time's texture signals early and deepens through one meaningful intensification in the sun's light tasting of iron, reweighting options under the Accumulative lens with felt cost in the shift to exchange-based time. Pressure coheres via accumulating sensations, forcing stance crystallization in the final realization without coincidence resolving it. Agency manifests in endurance and attention that foreclose numerical paths, with visible price in the rattling pockets and rib-texture shift. No multiple reversals required; the single deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of time as sensory narrative exchange emerges organically from particulars like embedded tag messages, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the unnumbered waltz and iron taste. Subtext in images like the cracked urn and price tags invites reflection on memory's currency without confusion, culminating in a resonant, non-literal final image repricing the premise. No overt statements or symbolic convenience; resonance arises from character struggle. Emotional aftereffect lingers through concrete complexity, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV maintains controlled distance, with perceptual signature in selective noticing of shapes and textures biased by the timekeeper's timeless state. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, lyric syntax like "each rung a sentence he could feel in his palms," modulating with pressure without head-hopping. Dialogue, when present (boy's shout and shrug), feels natural, subtextual, and advances plot with regional idiom. Patterned elision in surreal elements is taught early and pays off at closure, with no register mismatches.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with sentences like "time passing was granular, a fine metallic dust that settled on the tongue of the attentive" advancing atmosphere and theme without loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies naturally, with syntactic variety accelerating in climbs and breathing in realizations; no artifacts obscure closure. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the light's arrival. Clarity and propulsion hold, with strong verbs and specific nouns propelling to the resonant end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Core premise of post-numerical time rediscovered through garage sale narratives offers fresh synthesis, transforming familiar surreal tropes via specific details like tag descriptions as smuggled poems. Risk-taking in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight through organic combinations. No close echoes of famous works; authenticity coheres in singular vision of time as exchange. Emotional specificity avoids generics, with bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
