<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to aid the boy is clear and intensifies through her pragmatic theft and gentle guidance, rooted in consistent traits like wistful pragmatism that compel high-stakes choices with felt costs. Interiority is concrete and embodied, showing contradictory impulses in her reframing theft as "translation" while knowing municipal fines. The relationship with the boy acts as a crucible, forcing choices that alter their states by the end, with micro-choices revealing values like in pressing the lavender into his palm. Flaws complicate her actions without hedging, culminating in an earned stasis where she accepts the tooth's loss as mission complete.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through poetic shards with legible transitions, anchoring who (Mara), where (rooftop garden by harbor), and when (moonlit night after petal drop) early without disorientation. Causality holds via motivated actions like stealing the tooth to unlock the door, leading to a resonant reconfiguration in the boy's empowered descent with a "small reflected moon." Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise, with conceptual cost in the dissolving petal and fallen tooth symbolizing foreclosed paths and new beginnings. One meaningful deepening suffices, with the final image reweighting stakes through accumulated motifs like oars and light.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The luminous harbor by moonlight anchors vividly and purposefully, constraining choices like Mara's rooftop ascent and the boy's view from the parapet, charging the final image of dawn with diesel and starfish scents. Sensory details are selective, POV-biased, and balanced, reflecting urgency in moon-glow work and harbor reflections mirroring internal hush. Setting evolves causally, from mildew stairwell to rooftop garden, guiding actions like throwing moonlight "like a scatter of seeds." Micro-setting of the lock and petal functions as environment, pressuring the climax without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reflecting light into dark corners signals early and tightens once through the door-unlocking, narrowing options with the risk of discovery and deepening via the petal's glow instilling courage. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with agency in Mara's renunciation of the tooth foreclosing safety but enabling the boy's stance crystallization. Cost is legible in the fallen tooth and dissolved petal, charging the final image without coincidence resolving. Moral calculus sharpens the choice between theft and promise-keeping, with one credible loss altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of finding courage in endings and promises emerges organically from images like the fallen petal as "eviction notice" and oar rhythms, inviting reflection through ambiguity in protected vulnerability. Subtext operates in gestures like pressing lavender and the petal glowing "like parchment held to fire," eliciting emotional aftereffect without sentimentality. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer to instilling light, reweighting premises with conceptual cost in dust riding the wind. Complexity embraces counter-readings, with theme inextricable from Mara's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature in Mara's biased noticing of harbor as "blade pressed flat against skin" and syntax reflecting her wistful mind. Prose texture is distinct, with rhythmic control in patterned motifs like oar rhythms, modulating under pressure without head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but natural, subtextual, and goal-driven, as in "See?... Every oar is a promise," advancing plot via vulnerability. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early, paying off at closure with legible effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, every sentence advancing atmosphere and character through vivid images like "tide nosed the pilings" without loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the ascent and breathing at the hush, with syntactic variety supporting emphasis. Figurative language is controlled, coherent, and payoff-driven, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the lock sighing. Opening anchors voice; final line resolves by recharging motifs with propulsion and clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing fire escape gardening with harbor motifs and theft as "translation," offering fresh angle on vulnerability and courage through specific details like the bitting gauge tooth's notches. Tropes of rescue are transformed via grounded choices in Mara's flawed pragmatism, feeling inevitable with risk-taking in lyric structure heightening stakes. Core premise commits fully, avoiding generics with memorable perspective in the boy's "small reflected moon." One fresh inflection in the tooth's fall enabling a nasturtium root charges closure organically.</comment>
