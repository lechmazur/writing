<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to help the boy is clear and rooted in her wistfully pragmatic traits, intensifying through her theft and rooftop teaching, with embodied emotions like the "quivering hush" revealing contradictory impulses in her gentle persistence. The relationship with the boy acts as a crucible, forcing her to confront dark corners and instill courage, culminating in an earned stasis where she accepts the cost of her illicit garden. Strengths include concrete interiority tied to gardening actions, such as coaxing tomatoes and snapping lavender, which reveal her values under pressure. The boy's passivity slightly limits secondary pressure, but it doesn't undermine the holistic character arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images like oars and petals, with one meaningful deepening when the lock opens, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final rooftop teaching that reweights the boy's stance with felt emotional cost. Orientation anchors who (Mara), where (harbor loft roof), and when (moonlit night after petal drop) by the first paragraph, waiving any test penalty. Closure lands on-page with the boy's descent carrying a "small reflected moon," foreclosing his prior cage-like isolation. Minor slip in ellipsis between stairwell and roof, but it serves the lyric pattern without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The luminous harbor by moonlight constrains choices, pressuring Mara's stealthy movements and charging the final image of the rower flinging silver chains, which reconfigures the theme of forward pull. Sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, like diesel and starfish tastes mirroring her protected vulnerability, with the roof garden's paint buckets and rusted railing guiding actions tactilely. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from fire escape to stairwell to parapet, evolving causally with the tide and dawn. Strengths culminate in the environment mirroring internal states without overt symbolism, elevating to 9+ with the harbor's persistent constraint on her mission.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reflecting light into dark corners tightens through the lock-opening deepening, narrowing options and forcing agency in her promise to the boy, with a felt cost in the tooth's loss and petal's dissolution under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Pressure coheres via internal want (prove sky exists) versus fear (municipal fines, landlords), culminating in stance crystallization at dawn. One meaningful cadence shift suffices, with the boy's eyes reflecting light as a micro-turn complicating her ethics. Visible price in her "protected vulnerability" charges the ending, but coincidence of the tooth's availability slightly undercuts pure agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of instilling courage through memory and nature emerges organically from images like the glowing petal and lavender sprig, resisting tidy morals by embracing ambiguity in Mara's theft as "translation" and the boy's silent hush. Subtext in gestures, such as hand on shoulder measuring seasons, invites reflection on vulnerability without confusion, with the final oar metaphor offering a resonant, non-literal answer to cages versus afloat promises. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars like the petal's dust riding wind, avoiding sentimentality. Strength in thematic complexity via plausible counter-readings of her actions as reckless, charging the Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature in Mara's gardener-biased noticing of petals and soil, modulating rhythm under pressure like the oar cadence during ascent. Prose texture distinct through poetic syntax and moon-glow imagery, teaching patterned elision early for lyric effect paid off at closure. Dialogue is sparse but natural, subtext-heavy in whispers like "See? Every oar is a promise," advancing the boy's arc without exposition. No head-hopping or register drift, with psychic distance shifting intentionally for emotional beats, hitting 9+ via rhythmic control and taught compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose propels with high density, varying rhythm in oar-like echoes and concise images like "papery petal lay on the decking like a tiny eviction notice," avoiding loops or scaffold while accelerating in stairwell descent. Figurative language coheres without muddle, like the lock sighing, serving momentum in peak beats. Zero artifacts in closure, with strong verbs and specific nouns like "phosphorescence" heightening atmosphere. Minor overwriting in one stacked metaphor ("sliver shaped like a question mark"), but it doesn't touch the final image, preserving high propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing gardening on a fire escape with harbor imagery and lock-picking for emotional rescue, transforming trope of hidden child through Mara's wistful pragmatism and the tooth's reckless drop. Fresh inflection in the petal's glow teaching courage over swords, feeling inevitable via established motifs. Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, cohering as a singular vision. Proximity to poetic archetypes like moonlit harbors is elevated by specific details like nasturtium rooting in gutters, avoiding derivative pitfalls.</comment>
