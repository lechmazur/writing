<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The traveler's motivation to seek healing through obituary-writing is clear and intensifies via reflective micro-choices, with embodied emotions like trembling fingers and aching joints revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, and the final transformation feels earned by prior causality with a felt cost of lonesome absence. No other characters are on-page, so relationship bullets are ignored, but single-POV interior contradiction shines, especially in the self-recognition moment where she sees herself as her own first client.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern breaks in thread-unwinding deepening toward a Conceptual Repricing closure, where the traveler's realization reweights absence as presence with conceptual cost legible in the planted thread and empty notebook. Orientation anchors who (traveler), where (shadowed garden), and when (after last ship, autumn evening to dawn) by ~120 words, waiving any penalty. Single continuous scene fits defaults, with one meaningful deepening sufficient; closure lands on-page with undeniable pressure, though cost is more oblique than visceral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The shadowed autumn garden is vividly specific, with leaves patterning like words and shadows as portals, filtered through the traveler's biased perception and constraining her choices by illuminating paths tied to her work. Sensory details balance visual (pale fingers of light) with tactile (warm pulsing thread), evolving causally as shadows deepen then lift, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. The setting charges the final image, where paths spell her obituary, constraining the closure and meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding healing geography signals early and deepens via thread-unwinding, narrowing options to a stance crystallization under Accumulative lens, with agency in projecting presence foreclosing ordinary life paths at a felt emotional cost. One meaningful pattern break (faces emerging, self-recognition) suffices, though coincidence in garden responses complicates without resolving. Moral calculus between absence and presence sharpens the peak, but cost clarity is conceptual rather than sharply visceral, holding back from higher bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transforming absence into presence emerges organically from thread imagery and client visions, culminating in a resonant, non-literal final image of planting the thread as a seed, reweighting the premise without stated moral and meeting the 9+ test. Subtext in gestures like winding/unmaking patterns invites reflection on chosen endings, with emotional honesty avoiding sentimentality. Insights arise from specific struggles, like writing her own obituary in reverse, embracing complexity without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with distinct perceptual signature in poetic noticing of patterns and absences, and rhythmic control heightens pressure through syntactic variety without elision issues, meeting the 9+ test. Narrative stance modulates with intensity, from trembling arrival to dawn recognition, with diction within the traveler's lexicon. No dialogue present, so ignored; no head-hopping or reliability slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with multi-job sentences, varied rhythm, and no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts, propelling momentum through concise, purposeful imagery like "ink-stained fingers trembling." Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the self-recognition, with strong verbs and specific nouns enhancing clarity. Opening anchors voice, final line recharges motifs; zero text artifacts touch closure, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of obituary-writing for the living with a pulsing thread-map feels inevitable, transforming familiar healing quests through specific, metaphorical depth and risk-taking in abstract structure that heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, meeting the 9+ test. Premise offers fresh angle on absence, with emotional specificity avoiding generics. No derivative echoes; authenticity coheres in lonesome splendor tone.</comment>
