<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The traveler's motivation to understand healing through writing obituaries is clear and intensifies, compelling her transformative choices; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like trembling fingers and aching joints revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. Internal conflict shows in her recognition of herself as her own first client, earning the endurance of absence with felt cost. Flaws like self-imposed isolation complicate her journey without hedging, and micro-choices, such as winding the thread, reveal values with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Structure fits Accumulative/Textural lens with patterned elisions building to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the traveler plants the thread and recognizes her transformation, with felt cost in releasing absences. Orientation anchors who (traveler), where (shadowed garden), and when (after last ship sails) early, serving the lyric payoff. One meaningful deepening occurs as faces emerge, reweighting knowledge without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The shadowed autumn garden anchors vividly with purposeful details like bare branches and fallen leaves patterning words, constraining choices and charging the final image of planting the thread. Sensory hierarchy reflects the traveler's bias, with light filtering like pale fingers mirroring internal states. Environment evolves causally, deepening atmosphere and supporting theme without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding healing tightens through the thread's unwinding, deepening via emerging faces that force stance crystallization with conceptual cost in self-recognition. Pressure accumulates texturally, with one meaningful cadence shift narrowing options. Agency in projecting presence forecloses paths, earning the resonant ending without coincidence resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of absence becoming presence emerges organically from images like the pulsing thread and visionary portals, inviting reflection through ambiguity without confusion. Final image of planting the thread offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of healing as inhabiting absences. Subtext in gestures like kneeling and winding enriches complexity, avoiding tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with perceptual signature in ink-stained fingers and obituary-writing bias; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, lyric syntax that modulates with intensity. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision of backstory is patterned and paid off at closure. Focalization controlled, with purposeful compression teaching the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like "The weft thread pulsed warm against her palm" advancing atmosphere and character without loops or artifacts. Figurative language integrates purposefully, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the thread's transformation. Clarity and propulsion strong, with final line recharging motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of obituary-writing for the living with a magical thread transforms familiar tropes of loss into a fresh angle on healing, feeling inevitable through specific details like backward-aging child. Risk in lyric, abstract structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise commits fully, avoiding derivative echoes.</comment>
