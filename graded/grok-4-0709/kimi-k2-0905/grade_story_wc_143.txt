<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inspector's motivation to document extinction is clear and intensifies through embodied emotions like her cracking voice on "intervention," revealing contradictory impulses of curiosity and mourning that culminate in an earned renunciation with emotional cost. Interiority is concrete and particular, with micro-choices like dribbling water on the sand grain showing values under pressure. Flaws, such as her isolation, complicate the witnessing without artificial balance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through descriptive shards to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the final shutter clicks reweight the premise of forgotten miracles with undeniable emotional cost, evident in the "ghost flower" imprint. Orientation anchors early with the summit climb and Earthrise. One meaningful deepening suffices, but minor redundancy in reflective loops slightly softens propulsion without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lunar setting is vivid and purposeful, with details like vitrified regolith and terminator wind constraining choices and charging the final fossil imprint image. Sensory hierarchy reflects the inspector's urgency, filtering through her POV bias. Micro-setting elements, such as the feldspar vein, evolve causally and mirror internal melancholy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of capturing the anemones' bloom tightens through the chemical timer, forcing stance crystallization under time pressure with felt emotional cost in the closing petals. Escalation reads as density increase via syncing glows and wind gust, reweighting options. Coincidence like the meteor complicates without resolving, but stakes remain somewhat abstract beyond personal mourning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of curiosity as mourning emerges organically through images like the anemones' bioluminescent regret and the stolen sand grain, offering a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the Space Age's abandonment without moralizing. Subtext in gestures and silences invites reflection on extinction's cost. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality via complex ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in selective noticing of phosphorescence and haptic heartbeats, modulating rhythm under pressure without head-hopping. Prose texture in syntax and diction reflects the inspector's melancholic state, teaching patterned elision that pays off at closure. No dialogue present, so those bullets ignored.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, as in the crystalline clicks and metallic heartbeats, free of loops or artifacts; metaphors like "paper lantern" are coherent and heighten atmosphere without muddle. Information density advances character and stakes in every line, with strong verbs and specific nouns. Final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sci-fi elements like chemical sand timers and lunar anemones transforms extinction tropes through specific, voice-driven details, feeling inevitable with risk-taking in lyric compression that heightens emotional stakes. Core premise offers a fresh angle on witnessing without gimmickry. No close echoes of familiar scenes.</comment>
