<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to honor overlooked histories intensifies compellingly, driving the high-stakes choice to return the fragment, with embodied emotions like vertigo and exhaling a life revealing contradictory impulses in the climax. Interiority is concrete and particular, showing flaws in clinging to the shard that compound before the earned renunciation, foreclosing attachment with felt cost. The single-POV focus excels in perceptual specificity, though secondary characters like the old woman apply minimal pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the mosaic structure with time shards builds through patterned elision and resonant callbacks, landing a Conceptual Repricing closure where returning the fragment reweights intuition as a tide with undeniable conceptual cost in the final image. Orientation anchors early in the market setting, with deliberate disorientation during the painting step paying off at closure. One meaningful deepening suffices, but causality feels slightly elliptical in the exchange beat, capping high-band entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The alchemist’s market high above rooftops constrains choices vividly, with swaying bridges mirroring vertigo and pressuring the step into the painting, while the lighthouse fragment as recurring object charges the final image of projected beams. Sensory details like copper-salt air and creaking ropes are selective and POV-biased, evolving causally to echo the lost tower. Micro-setting of the painting integrates action, though city below remains somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of releasing histories tightens through the painting's tilt, forcing a deepening that narrows options and crystallizes stance in the exchange, with felt cost of absence weighing more under the Textural lens. One meaningful cadence shift suffices, driven by agency in stepping through and offering the shard. Coincidence of the painting's appearance complicates without resolving, but moral calculus could sharpen the peak choice further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of releasing to keep emerges organically from images like gulls freed from paintings and the fragment's return, offering a resonant non-literal answer that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like exhaling a life and the spiral lanterns invites reflection on intuition's tide. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding sentimentality in the quiet ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in lyrical compression, like "elusively tangible" warmth, and rhythmic control heightens pressure in the exchange without head-hopping. Brief dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, advancing the vendor's call and protagonist's reply to charge closure. Patterned elision is taught early and paid off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose density is high with vivid, propulsion-driven sentences like "the painting’s horizon tilts, and for an eternal instant the catwalk becomes that cliff," varying rhythm naturally without loops or artifacts. Figurative language integrates purposefully, avoiding muddle in peak beats, and information advances atmosphere and arc concisely. No scaffold or redundancy dulls momentum, though one synonym pair ("copper and salt") repeats without harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-travel via paintings and returning a shard to oneself transforms familiar memory tropes through specific details like the gull's heartbeat signature, feeling inevitable with risk heightening stakes in the step-through. Emotional specificity in the lullaby reversal avoids generics, committing to the premise without retreat. Bold lyric structure coheres as singular vision, though premise echoes magical realism archetypes slightly.</comment>
