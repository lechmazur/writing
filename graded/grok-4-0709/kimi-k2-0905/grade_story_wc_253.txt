<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The performer's moral ambiguity is vividly embodied through her past actions and current whittling narration, creating contradictory impulses that drive her choices; the officer's reluctant shift adds relational pressure, culminating in an earned stasis with felt cost in their shared carving. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, though secondary characters like the crow feel more symbolic than pressuring. The final micro-choice of planting stems reveals a hierarchy of values, charging the closure without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned shards of narration and interaction, leading to a resonant reconfiguration in the final image of darkened soil and possible lightness; orientation anchors early with the porch and turbines, and closure lands with conceptual cost via the sky's tear. One meaningful deepening suffices, with the crow's intervention and officer's joining tightening the hush's pressure. No causality breaks, though the crow's speech introduces a lyric elision that pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The farmhouse porch overshadowed by turbines constrains choices, with shavings snatched by wind and shadows quivering flowers, charging the final planting image; sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, mirroring grief through withered fields and remade hush. Micro-setting like the bouquet and sticks evolves causally, guiding action without static repetition. The environment pressures the performer's narration, heightening atmosphere purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of cultivating lightness in grief escalates texturally through accumulating acts of whittling and narration, with the crow's rebellion and officer's participation deepening pressure to a stance crystallization; one tightening suffices, foreclosing enforced cheer with felt cost in the planted stems. Agency via renunciation charges the ending, though coincidence in the crow complicates without resolving. Moral calculus sharpens the peak, avoiding static loops.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of grief as soil for lightness emerges organically from images like the bouquet's skeleton and turbine hush, offering a resonant, non-literal answer in the final reconfiguration without moralizing; subtext in silences and implications enriches complexity. The core concept integrates through events, eliciting emotional aftereffect via purposeful ambiguity. No thematic echo or overt symbolism dilutes resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward blank-faced emotional void; dialogue feels natural, subtextual, and distinct, advancing the accumulative drive. Patterned elision in lyric mode is taught early and pays off at closure, with rhythmic control modulating under pressure. No head-hopping or register drifts mar the singular voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and rhythm accelerating through key images like the sky's tear; no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle obscure clarity, especially at closure. Information density is high, sentences multitasking without redundancy. Read-aloud flow is natural, with purposeful punctuation enhancing the textural lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of post-mandate hush transformed through specific whittling narration and crow interaction feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric compression heightening stakes; emotional specificity avoids tropes, synthesizing dystopian elements organically. No derivative echoes, and the bold vision coheres singularly. One non-obvious synthesis in the turbine-lodged feather charges ingenuity.</comment>
