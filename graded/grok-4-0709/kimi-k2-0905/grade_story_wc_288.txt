<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to translate isolation into independence is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like leaping from the library and placing the sundial, revealing contradictory impulses in her herd memories versus singular future. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with emotions like trembling legs and inhaled scents showing flaws without stock phrasing. The earned stasis at the end forecloses communal paths with felt cost, as her spine lengthens and shadows point forward. Voice distinction shines in her neighed responses to stars, avoiding stereotypes through surreal specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images like hums and shadows, with one meaningful deepening at the henge where memory splits, leading to a resonant reconfiguration in the final prairie entry. Orientation anchors who (quagga), where (tidal library), and when (post-reincarnation) by ~120 words, with deliberate surreal disorientation paying off at closure. Causality holds via motivated elisions, like the fall meeting the hum, without teleporting props. Closure lands with conceptual cost, reweighting extinction into uncharted eras via the singing prairie.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The surreal setting of the tidal library above clouds and stone circle constrains choices, like waiting for tides to leap, with sensory details like salt-stiff scrolls and gill-feathered archivist filtered through the quagga's POV bias. Atmosphere evolves causally, from moon-lit catalogues to star-corridors, mirroring internal independence via grass scents and vacuum jars. A recurring object (brass sundial) charges the final image by etching the solitude equation, meeting the 9+ test. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, with hooves sparking static and cantering along curves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of gaining independence from isolation signals early and tightens once via the henge choice, narrowing options by splitting memory with visible cost in erased herd needs. Pressure accumulates texturally through cadence shifts, like the hum softening into a pulse, forcing stance crystallization without coincidence resolving. Agency shines in renunciation, as she chooses self over company, with moral calculus between communal past and singular future. Meets 9+ test threshold but minor abstraction in final prairie slightly softens cost legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of solitude equaling momentum emerges organically from images like the sundial's shadow split and lungs photosynthesizing independence, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the prairie's song. Subtext operates in silent questions and flickering star queries, eliciting emotional aftereffect through conceptual repricing of extinction. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to isolation, reweighting the premise without statement. Earned wisdom arises from specifics like rifle cracks versus forward shadows, avoiding platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV stays stable with clean focalization, perceptual signature biased toward extinct heartbeats and atomic reflections, modulating rhythm under pressure like short fall sentences. Prose texture distinct in syntax like "hooves tucked, through a window of clouded glass," with purposeful compression teaching surreal patterns paid off at closure. Brief dialogue (archivist's hiss, stars' flickers) carries subtext and advances plot naturally, distinguishing idiom. No head-hopping; elision of forgetting length heightens momentum without withholding known facts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with sentences like "The fall felt shorter than forgetting; the hum rose up to meet her like a net of sound," advancing atmosphere and character without loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in leaps and breathing in waits, with syntactic variety avoiding templates. Figurative language coherent and purposeful, no muddle in peak beats like henge touching. Zero artifacts; opening anchors voice, final line recharges motifs with prairie song.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of reincarnation, extinct species, and mythical tech like atomically reflective sundials feels inevitable, transforming tropes through quagga-specific choices like neighing to stars. Bold risk in surreal mosaic shards heightens stakes without gimmickry, with fresh inflection in solitude equation reweighting isolation. Avoids derivative premises by committing to premise implications, like teaching lungs independence. Proximity check clear; authenticity coheres as singular vision.</comment>
