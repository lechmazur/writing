<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is compellingly rooted in grief and survival, with interiority concretely embodied through interactions like pressing the geode to the telescope, revealing contradictory impulses of preservation versus exploitation. The final renunciation feels earned by accumulating micro-choices, such as smashing the circuit breaker, foreclosing paths with visible emotional cost in the crumbling fragments tasting like wedding cake. No stock phrasing dilutes the specificity, and flaws like becoming "death's accountant" complicate choices without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increasing through patterned geode imagery, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration via the protagonist's fall, which reweights unlived potentials with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors early in the observatory post-strike, and the single-shard structure with reflective elisions pays off at closure without causality breaks. Minor waiver on deliberate disorientation in futures serves the ending's charged poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating observatory setting constrains choices tactilely, with helium sacs and circuit breakers evolving causally to pressure the fall, charging the final image of diving into the desert. Sensory details are selective and POV-biased, mirroring internal devastation through starlight on shattered ribs and wind patterns altering drone paths. Micro-setting of the geode as object-environment integrates seamlessly, guiding action without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of harvesting unlived potentials tightens meaningfully through the geode's crumbling, deepening via realizations that force stance crystallization under the Accumulative lens, with agency in the fall foreclosing life for a trade-off saving a village. Cost is legible in the protagonist's suicide, though coincidence in wind patterns slightly complicates without resolving. One intensification suffices, narrowing options with ethical calculus between grief and exploitation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of grief as resource extraction emerges organically from geode facets showing collapsed futures, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the final dive that reweights unlived moments without moralizing. Subtext in images like crumbling stardust tasting of cake invites ambiguity, embracing complexity in moral ambiguity without false equivalence. Emotional aftereffect lingers through particulars, avoiding platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in fractured, crystalline imagery, modulating rhythm under stress without head-hopping or register drift. Purposeful compression in reflective elisions is taught early and paid off at closure, enhancing pressure. Prose texture reflects the focalizer's degraded perception, with syntax breathing in step with exhilaration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with sentences multitasking imagery and advancement, like the geode's warmth building momentum without loops or scaffold. Rhythmic variety accelerates in the hunt beats, and metaphors cohere without muddle, though dense figuratives in peak moments are pattern-taught and purposeful. No artifacts obscure closure, with strong verbs propelling the final dive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes sci-fi grief with perturbation theory in a non-obvious way, transforming tropes of survival through specific geode mechanics that feel inevitable, heightening stakes via bold risk in suicidal reconfiguration. Voice and concept cohere singularly, with fresh inflection in harvesting unlived lives as resource. No derivative echoes, committing fully without retreat.</comment>
