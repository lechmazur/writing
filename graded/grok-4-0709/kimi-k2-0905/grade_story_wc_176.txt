<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to preserve forgotten names is clear and intensifies through embodied actions like threading the rope, revealing internal contradictions between past guilt and present forgiveness; interiority is concrete, with emotions like tears freezing into lenses showing contradictory impulses in scene. The meaningful change—leaving lighter by guilt but heavier by voices—is earned by prior causality, foreclosing the path of unresolved trauma with visible emotional cost in the resonance moment. Flaws complicate choices authentically, as the shadow no longer wearing the old silhouette highlights a hierarchy of values paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and reflections toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final resonance, with conceptual cost legible in the protagonist's shifted burden and the card's dissolution into air. Orientation anchors who (lost wax caster), where (icebound sanctum), and when (night under aurora turning to dawn) by the first paragraph, waiving any penalty. One meaningful deepening occurs as the rope remembers the pattern, tightening toward closure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum and aurora are vividly specific, with sensory details like petrified incense and fractured lavender constraining choices, such as warming strands to reconfigure the rope. The setting charges the final image, as snowmelt carries names southward, reweighting the premise of preservation. Details evolve causally, mirroring internal states through aurora flares and hoarfrost, with spatial choreography coherent in the ritual acts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake of preserving forgotten names tightens through the ritual's deepening, narrowing options as the rope lifts and voices unfold, forcing a stance crystallization under the Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in the emotional trade-off of guilt released for voices carried, with the climax's resonance foreclosing isolation. One meaningful cadence shift in the aurora's flare reweights the stake authentically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of preservation as continuing vibration emerges organically from images like the punched card dissolving into air, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to memory's fragility without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like lacing the wound shut invites reflection on forgiveness and loss, with emotional honesty avoiding sentimentality. The final image reweights the premise, embracing complexity through the protagonist's earned wisdom from specific ritual experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in lyrical, image-dense prose, like tasting names on the tongue, maintaining rhythmic control under pressure without elision issues. Narrative stance modulates with intensity, syntax reflecting the focalizer's reflective state, such as in the aurora's shifting lantern. No dialogue present, so no evaluation there; purposeful compression teaches patterns early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in sentences like "tears freezing into delicate lenses that cracked when I smiled," advancing atmosphere and character without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the rope's lifting. High information density layers multiple jobs per line, with clean grammar and syntactic variety supporting the lyrical momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes lost wax casting with punched card memory and ceremonial ropes in a fresh, non-obvious way, feeling inevitable through the ritual's organic turns. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes of preservation via specific details like the aurora's fractured lavender. Emotional specificity avoids generics, committing to the vision with authenticity.</comment>
