<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mireya's motivation to decode and remember forgotten things intensifies compellingly, rooted in her traits as an orderly sorter, leading to higher-stakes choices like releasing the moonstone with felt cost. Interiority is concrete, with embodied transformations like sharpened senses, showing contradictory impulses in her ritualistic yet adaptive actions. The meaningful change to Keeper of Tiny Monuments is earned by prior causality, foreclosing isolation with collective memory's cost. Flaws are minor, but emotional progression could layer more irrationality in peak moments, as in the seventh dawn climb.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned shards of observation and monument-building, with one meaningful deepening at the moonstone release leading to resonant reconfiguration via the sky's acceptance. Orientation anchors who (Mireya), where (skyborne arbor), and when (dawns and hush) early, within ~120 words. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with conceptual cost of releasing forgotten burdens, visible in the verdant mirror arbor. Minor slip in ellipsis between dawns slightly softens causality, but pattern holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is vividly specific, with silver-barked trees and upward-falling leaves constraining choices, like climbing the highest bough for release. Sensory details are purposeful, balancing visual runes and auditory hums filtered through Mireya's POV, evolving causally as leaves drift downward in fragrant mulch. Atmosphere supports the fantastical tone, with the environment charging the final image of glinting monuments. A recurring object (moonstone speck) constrains the decoding action and charges closure, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring equilibrium through remembering tightens accumulatively via monument-building, with one meaningful deepening at the seventh dawn release forcing stance crystallization under coherent pressure. Agency in Mireya's decisions, like prodding the leaf and releasing the speck, forecloses paths with felt cost of transformation and loss. Escalation reads as pattern break in leaves spiraling faster, reweighting stakes without coincidence resolving. Cost is legible in the burst radiance and heart's mossy delight, but could be more viscerally embodied at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of collective memory preventing loss emerges organically from monuments to forgotten things, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer via the mirror arbor without stated moral. Subtext in runes and folklore invites reflection on what deserves remembering, with purposeful ambiguity in the dialogue between grove and mortals. Emotional aftereffect is concrete through Mireya's transformed senses, avoiding sentimentality. The final image reweights the premise, meeting the 9+ test, though thematic complexity could embrace more counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Mireya's selective noticing of hums and runes, modulating rhythmically under pressure like in the hush. Prose texture is distinct, with purposeful syntax in phrases like "leaves rise, monuments are built," teaching patterned elision that pays off at closure. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; free indirect style is clean, with distance shifts serving emotional beats. Distinct signature and control under pressure meet the 9+ test, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, each sentence advancing atmosphere or theme, like the opening ritual anchoring voice. Rhythm varies naturally, with syntactic variety in metaphors like "soft thunder" avoiding muddle; no loops or scaffolds detected. Figurative language is controlled, enhancing propulsion without overwriting in peak beats like the moonstone burst. Zero artifacts and clear propulsion meet the 9+ test, though one more varied paragraph length could elevate further.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise of upward-falling leaves and tiny monuments offers fresh synthesis on memory and forgetting, feeling inevitable through folklore integration. Tropes like prophecy are transformed via specific choices, like labeling an acorn cup for extinct starlings' laughter. Risk-taking in lyric mosaic heightens stakes without gimmickry, cohering as singular vision. A non-obvious inflection in the mirror arbor meets the 9+ test, with +0.3 bonus for bold structure.</comment>
