<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to catalog abandoned dreams is clear and intensifies through her ritualistic actions, with embodied emotions like wincing at a gull's cry revealing contradictory impulses; the final renunciation feels earned with visible emotional cost in the lighter inkwell, making her flaws and micro-choices drive a resonant endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through descriptive shards in one continuous scene with legible orientation by the first paragraph; closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing via the final image of walking inland, reweighting separations as foundations with conceptual cost, though one ellipsis feels slightly unmotivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion is vividly rendered with selective sensory details like dripping chains and lapping water, constraining Mara's choices and charging the final image under the dome; atmosphere mirrors her internal absences through purposeful contrasts, evolving causally with her movements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mourning abandoned dreams tightens through deepening rituals, with one meaningful intensification at the dome forcing stance crystallization under the textural lens; emotional cost is felt in the confessions, though external pressure remains subtle without narrowing options more sharply.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of interlaced absences emerges organically from images like hollow arches and sealed notes, inviting reflection on memory's permanence without tidy morals; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of separations as foundations, enriching complexity through Mara's stoic sensitivity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-specific, with perceptual bias in noticing ghosts of structures; prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, patterned diction that teaches its lyric compression early, paying off at closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, multi-job sentences like "boots kissing the wet marble steps," varying rhythm purposefully without loops or artifacts; figurative language coheres without muddle, propelling momentum to a charged final line that reweights the inkwell's lightness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes surveying with poetic archaeology in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming loss tropes through specific rituals like note-sealing; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens emotional stakes, feeling inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
