<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as a ghost-seer and technician is clear and intensifies through embodied internal conflict, with contradictory impulses like fixing versus falling shown in her decision to leave the barrel; the closure renunciation earns stasis with felt cost in accepting her cracks, as in "a thin line between the woman who fixes and the woman who falls."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images and cadence shifts to a resonant reconfiguration in the final decision, with orientation anchored by paragraph one; closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost in the ticket's warmth hoisting her upward, though one minor elision in the time crack feels slightly unanchored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is vividly specific with dust patterns and peeling posters constraining Mara's navigation and charging the closure, as moonlight through the window filters perception; sensory details like warped linoleum embody urgency, and the setting mirrors her internal fissures without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake in breaking the personal loop tightens through textural density in the rafter climb, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in leaving the barrel; agency via renunciation forecloses the fix-it path, though coincidence in ghost invitations slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of inevitable falls despite repairs emerges organically through images like fraying cables and the ticket stub, offering resonant ambiguity in the final ascent; subtext in ghost silences and the crack in time reweights the premise without moralizing, as the ending image reprices her burdens as weightless yet alive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature in Mara's skillful observation of dust and ghosts, rhythmic prose modulating with pressure like short sentences in the climb; patterned elision in the time loop is taught early and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm and vivid metaphors like "ghosts scattered like pigeons startled by a gunshot that happened years ago," advancing atmosphere without loops; some stacked figuratives in the rafter scene border on overwriting but serve textural escalation without muddling clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elevator repair with ghost-seeing in a circus setting transforms tropes through specific details like the 1987 ticket stubs, heightening stakes in the time crack; risk in lyric nonlinearity feels inevitable, as the final ticket handover recharges the premise without gimmickry.</comment>
