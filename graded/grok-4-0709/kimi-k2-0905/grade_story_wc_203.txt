<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to retrieve the mainspring while engaging ghosts is clear and rooted in her technician traits, with embodied interiority shining in moments like climbing the ladder where contradictory impulses of fear and resolve act simultaneously. Internal conflict is shown through her realization of personal cracks, earning the endurance with felt cost as she carries the burden onward. The single-POV focus allows deep specificity without needing relationship dynamics, though ghosts as secondary pressures effectively force choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images like dust spirals and cracks, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the cupola where Mara recoils the spring, releasing ghosts with conceptual cost legible in her self-realization. Orientation anchors who (Mara), where (ticket office), and when (3:07 a.m.) by line two, waiving any penalty. One meaningful deepening occurs via the climb and winding, sufficient for length, though causality feels more textural than strict because/therefore chains.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is vividly specific, with details like sawdust raining upward and the cupola gears constraining Mara's choices, directly charging the final image as the building settles like an elevator. Sensory hierarchy reflects her observant POV, narrowing to tactile cold rungs under pressure. Environment evolves causally, mirroring her internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of retrieving the mainspring while bargaining with ghosts tightens accumulatively through the climb and winding, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in carrying the ghosts' burden. One deepening via the trapeze girl's whisper narrows options, driving agency in her decision to recoil halfway. Pressure coheres texturally, though coincidence in ghost appearances complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of hidden burdens and self-repair emerges organically from recurring crack motifs that reweight at closure, offering a resonant non-literal answer as Mara admits the dead slipping inside her. Subtext in gestures like the ringmaster's bow and girl's smile invites reflection on vertical desires without tidy morals. Emotional aftereffect lingers through the ticking barrel, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in Mara's technician-biased noticing, like analyzing dust as schematics, and rhythmic prose modulates with pressure, compressing under stress. Purposeful elision in ghost arrivals is taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue beyond whispers, so policy skips those bullets; voice texture is poetic yet controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, multi-job sentences like "moonlight dripped through broken stained glass, pooling on gears tall as tombstones," varying rhythm naturally without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, accelerating momentum in the climb. Final line resolves by recharging crack motifs with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elevator technician as ghost-seer in a circus ruin transforms tropes through specific details like the tin top and mainspring, feeling inevitable as her skills enable the winding. Risk in textural accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on repair and burdens.</comment>
