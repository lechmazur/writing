<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as a former councilor turned exile leader is clear and intensifies through persistent actions like the food runs, revealing embodied emotions in her handling of the bell and pebbles; internal conflict shows in her quiet declarations versus the risk of sanctions, with the final silent ring earning a renunciation of open rebellion at visible cost. Secondary characters like the boy and Lita apply relevant pressure, forcing micro-choices that alter intergenerational ties. Strengths include concrete interiority without stock phrasing, but minor weakness in the boy's dialogue feeling slightly archetypal, though it doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through shards of midnight activity with legible transitions, anchoring who (Mara), where (ridge/arbor), and when (midnight to dawn) early; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise in the silent bell vibration, reweighting the network's endurance with felt cost of ongoing sanctions. One meaningful deepening occurs as the cart empties and pebbles accumulate, tightening toward the spiral's potential completion. Orientation is strong, with no disorientation debt, and causality holds through patterned elisions like the bell's muffled tremor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor anchors the setting vividly, constraining choices like waiting for signals and placing pebbles, while evolving details like flakes "glinting like dried blood" and sage scent mirror internal hush; micro-setting of the bell and cart integrates into action, charging the final image where the arbor waits "like an open mouth." Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's urgency, with moonlight stripes and wind-pitched voice filtering through her bias. No generic placeholders; environment pressures the closure without over-description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><grade>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, dominant stake of building intergenerational support tightens through pattern breaks like the heavier cart and pebble spiral, forcing stance crystallization in the silent ring; one meaningful deepening via frequency over volume narrows options with legible cost of risked detection. Agency shines in Mara's renunciation of ringing aloud, foreclosing louder rebellion. Strength in coherent pressure without coincidence resolution, but minor slip in abstract stakes like "memories rationed" not fully visceral at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of amplified quiet in exile emerges organically from images like the muffled bell and pebble covenants, inviting reflection on silenced resistance without tidy morals; subtext in gestures like wool falling free reweights the premise at closure via Conceptual Repricing, with ambiguity in crates arriving or not lingering meaningfully. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars like the spiral's incompleteness, avoiding sentimentality. Strong resonance without direct statements, though one overt echo in "silence could be amplified quiet" borders on thematic declaration but integrates via action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV on Mara is stable with controlled distance, perceptual signature in selective notices like bell tremors and sage scent biasing toward quiet persistence; voice texture distinct in rhythmic, hushed syntax that modulates with dawn's bruise, teaching patterned elision early for legibility. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and goal-driven, distinguishing characters like the boy's hunger-striped whisper from Lita's trembling murmur. No head-hopping or register mismatch; elisions pay off at silent ring without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and pressure through vivid images like "valley lights dimmed like censored stars" without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, syntactic variety accelerating in action beats like cart rolling. No artifacts like synonym churn or filter stacks; metaphors cohere without muddle, as in terra-cotta flakes glinting consistently. Opening anchors stakes, final line recharges motifs with propulsion intact, though one simultaneity hint in dawn bruising is minor and doesn't dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Originality in synthesizing exile under sanctions with a silent bell as "map home" and pebble spirals for coded support feels fresh, transforming tropes of resistance through specific details like muffled clapper and frequency tactics; risk in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on intergenerational memory, cohering as singular vision. Minor echo of archetypal whisper networks, but grounded choices elevate it beyond template.</comment>
