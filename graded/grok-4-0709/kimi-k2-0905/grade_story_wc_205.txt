<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aurelio's motivation as a defunct revolutionary is clear and intensifies through poetic impulses, culminating in the scratched mirror line that earns a resonant endurance with felt cost of futility; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion in the bloodied shard moment; Mira's reverence adds relational pressure but remains secondary without deep contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Structure fits Track A with single POV and continuous scene shards linked by accumulative lens, anchoring orientation early in the asteroid's drift; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing via the glowing scratched line reweighting history with conceptual cost; causality holds texturally through image patterns, though some reflective blocks slightly loosen midpoint linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting is vivid and purposeful, with visible time ribbons and mirrors constraining choices like uncovering the Gate; sensory details filter through Aurelio's bias, charging the final shivering mirror image; atmosphere of burnished sorrow mirrors internal defeat without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reimagining civilization tightens accumulatively when they uncover the mirror and see the future, forcing Aurelio's scratching as a deepening with felt cost; pressure coheres under textural lens with one meaningful cadence shift; coincidence of the storm complicates but does not resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of poetry revising inevitable collapse emerges organically from shard and mirror motifs, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the rearranging letters; subtext in gestures like blood-smearing invites ambiguity without confusion; avoids moralizing, embracing complexity in revolutions as footnotes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual signature in poetic noticing, like hours as glass; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, figurative syntax that modulates with storm pressure; dialogue is natural and subtextual, as in Aurelio's sea-shore question advancing their plan.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm and high information in metaphors like molten pewter years, advancing atmosphere; some mixed vehicles (e.g., nooses braiding with thunder) create minor muddle without obscuring closure; no significant loops or artifacts, though figurative density borders overwriting in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of time-weaponized empire with archaeological guilds and poetic revolution feels inevitable, transforming sci-fi tropes through specific sorrow-infused imagery; risk in lyric structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry; the scratched line's glow offers fresh inflection on memory erasure.</comment>
