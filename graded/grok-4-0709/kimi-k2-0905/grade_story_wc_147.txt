<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to send the distress signal intensifies compellingly through embodied guilt and bruised knees, with contradictory impulses shown in her instinct to flee versus kicking deeper; the final renunciation of the vial earns a visible cost in her lungs burning, foreclosing solitude with relational reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned hush and memory motifs to a resonant reconfiguration in the organ's chord and reply, with orientation anchored early in the flooded nave; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in shrinking air, though one elision of rescue mechanics slightly softens causality without breaking the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The forgotten underwater temple constrains choices vividly, with cracked lapis tiles and coral-grown organ charging the final image of lilac bubbles; sensory details like salt tears and luminous plankton reflect POV urgency, mirroring internal hush without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of survival tightens through shrinking air and temple resistance, with one meaningful deepening when Mira overrides instinct using the vial, forcing stance crystallization under Situational pressure in the Accumulative lens; cost is legible in burning lungs, though coincidence of reply complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transforming solitude into connection emerges organically from vial and organ motifs, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer as the temple sings lilacs; subtext in touched memories invites ambiguity without confusion, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in scent-to-frequency translation, rhythmic prose modulating under stress like "breathless instant"; patterned elision in memories is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose density is high with purposeful metaphors like "lilac-tinged beacon," varying rhythm in slowmotion thunder; minor synonym loop in hush descriptions dulls one beat but doesn't touch closure, maintaining propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography and perfumed signal transforms underwater trope through specific lilac drop and organ, feeling inevitable with risk in poetic compression heightening thematic stakes; avoids stock archetypes via Mira's stubborn voice.</comment>
