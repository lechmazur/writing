<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to preserve hope is clear and intensifies through concrete micro-choices, like rubbing the stone and comparing footage, culminating in an earned renunciation with felt cost as she internalizes the shadow. Interiority is character-particular, with embodied contradictory emotions, such as the shadow stirring like a second heart, avoiding stock phrasing. The final choice reveals a hierarchy of values, foreclosing the path of sharing while accepting luminous regret.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and realizations to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Mira becomes the dusk, with conceptual cost in her vanishing. Orientation anchors who (Mira), where (blooming library above clouds), and when (after dreams became shareable) by the first sentence, serving the lyric payoff. One meaningful deepening occurs via the stone's metamorphosis, reweighting stakes without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The blooming library above clouds is vivid and purposeful, with orchid-walls exhaling perfume and shelves releasing pollen, constraining Mira's choices and charging the final image of the library drifting lighter yet heavier. Sensory details are selective, reflecting POV bias toward dusks, and evolve causally as petals fold at closure. The micro-setting of the stone and vault integrates into action, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving unshareable hope tightens through the stone's warming and metamorphosis, forcing stance crystallization under textural pressure with felt cost in Mira's luminous regret. One meaningful deepening narrows options, as the shadow unbound slips out and returns, reweighting the premise without coincidence resolving it. Agency via renunciation forecloses sharing, with moral calculus between mother's promise and monetized dreams.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of preserving hope's shape emerges organically from images like the stone's internal starlight and intertwined dreams, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final violet afterimage without moralizing. Subtext in gestures, such as rubbing the stone softly deliberately, invites reflection on loss and lightness. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars, embracing complexity with ambiguity in shared vs. unshareable elements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward dusks and violet shades, modulating rhythm under emotional intensity like the shadow's stirring. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax and word choice, teaching patterned elision early and paying off at closure without head-hopping. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; elision of actionable details heightens lyric effect legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in sentences like "the shadow unbound pressed against her ribs, whispering that hope was a shape that could be lost," advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the stone's rippling. High information density integrates action and image, with final line recharging motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of drowned worlds, shareable dreams, and a hope-holding stone feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like orchid-shelves and luminous regret. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to the premise's implications. Fresh angle on memory preservation avoids generics, with the unbound shadow offering non-obvious emotional complexity.</comment>
