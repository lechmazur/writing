<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mender's motivation is clear and intensifies through persistent actions like grafting and barring doors, rooted in feisty traits and generational vows; interiority shines in embodied emotions, such as muttering curses and feeling sap like unforgiving time. Contradictory impulses—resentment versus healing—act simultaneously in the climax of tying the ribbon, earning the endurance with felt cost in the ribbon's rot. The daughter's brief appearance applies secondary pressure effectively, but the single-POV focus limits deeper status dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned shards of imagery and action, with legible transitions and a coherent Resonant Reconfiguration at closure via the fragrance as conceptual repricing with undeniable cost in decayed vows composting to hope. Orientation anchors early with the mender climbing stairs in the crumbling cathedral. One meaningful deepening occurs in reading scrolls to grafting, reweighting stakes without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lush cathedral orchard is vividly specific, with sunlight striping bark and roots coiling corbels, constraining choices like climbing scaffolds and grafting; it charges the final image of petals snowing and fragrance drifting, mirroring internal persistence. Sensory details are purposeful, filtered through the mender's bias, evolving causally from breach to bloom.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of healing the orchard after breach signals early and tightens once through the grafting act, narrowing options with visible cost in the hissing sap and ribbon's rot; pressure coheres under textural lens via density increase in pollen and scrolls. Agency in renunciation (barring elders) forecloses forgiveness path with felt relational price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of deciduous vows composting to hope emerges organically from images like falling figs revealing scrolls and the ribbon's absorption into bark, offering a resonant non-literal answer that reweights persistence without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like knotting past and promise invites reflection on generational wisdom with ambiguity in forgiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with clean focalization on the mender's perceptual signature, like quartz monocle flashing and sap hissing; voice has distinct poetic texture in syntax and rhythm, modulating with pressure. Brief dialogue feels natural and subtextual, advancing plot in the daughter's question and mender's wise answer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, strong verbs like "crunching" and "hissing," and purposeful metaphors that integrate without muddle; no loops or artifacts obscure closure. Figurative language heightens in peak beats like the grafting, but occasional density borders overwriting without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fantastical elements like quartz-eye mender and rafter orchard feels inevitable, transforming tropes of broken promises through specific details like silver pollen and coconut fragrance; risk in lyric mosaic heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh inflection in the ribbon's rot reconfiguring vows avoids derivative patterns.</comment>
