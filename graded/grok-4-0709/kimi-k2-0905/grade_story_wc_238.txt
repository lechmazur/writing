<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The exorcist's motivation to apologize is clear and intensifies through embodied grief, with contradictory impulses shown in her hesitation with the perfume drop; the final admission "I was wrong" is earned by prior causality, foreclosing silence with visible emotional cost. Interiority is concrete and particular, using musical metaphors that reveal flaws without stock phrasing. Relationships as crucible apply via the ghostly sister, forcing a status shift under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through resonant images and cadence shifts to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure, with the ghost's release and lilac bloom repricing grief's cost on the page. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first paragraph, with no disorientation debt. Single continuous scene fits defaults, with one meaningful deepening via the perfume drop; minor ellipsis in the orchard's role feels motivated but slightly underlinked to causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sheet music archive is vividly specific, with dust motes as arpeggios and humming lights constraining choices, directly charging the final image of the felled tree's low E rattling the bottle. Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered, evolving causally with the induced currents and orchard threat. Atmosphere of ethereal grit mirrors internal dissonance without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconnection tightens once through the perfume ritual, forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative/Textural lens, with the apology foreclosing unresolved grief at felt emotional cost. Agency drives escalation via micro-choices like aligning the bottle with the clef, narrowing options without coincidence resolving. Moral calculus between banishment and forgiveness sharpens the peak, though secondary orchard pressure feels slightly additive rather than braided.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect miracles and forgiven silence emerges organically from images like the quivering drop and swirling notes, offering a resonant, non-literal answer in the lilac bloom that reweights grief without moralizing. Subtext in metaphors and silences invites reflection on absence as dissonance. Emotional aftereffect is concrete, avoiding sentimentality through complex ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in musical biases, modulating rhythm under pressure without head-hopping. Prose texture is purposeful and lyric, teaching patterned metaphors early for legibility at closure. Dialogue in pizzicato whispers advances subtext and feels natural, distinguishing the ghost's voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and rhythmic control accelerating through the ritual without loops or scaffold; metaphors like "grief is a violin without strings" are coherent and voice-motivated. No artifacts obscure closure, and information density layers action with atmosphere. Final line resolves by recharging the perfume bottle motif imagistically.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of gossip exorcism, musical hauntings, and imperfect miracles feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific metaphors and ethereal grit that heighten stakes. Risk in lyric structure pays off without gimmickry, offering fresh emotional truth on sibling grief. No derivative echoes, with bold commitment to the premise.</comment>
