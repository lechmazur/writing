<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The poet's motivation to develop and understand her scars is concrete and intensifies through micro-choices like agitating the tray and launching the plane, revealing contradictory impulses of pain and acceptance. Interiority is embodied in scar cartography and storm collaboration, with flaws like exile-driven silence complicating her unmasking. The final endurance forecloses erasure, earning stasis with visible emotional cost in the planetarium image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through image shards with legible transitions via storm progression, anchoring who (poet), where (observatory), and when (dusk storm) by ~50 words. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing in the planetarium reconfiguration, reweighting scars as belonging with conceptual cost of enduring trauma. One meaningful deepening suffices, but minor elision in envelope's origin slightly softens causality without breaking the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory constrains choices, with lightning pulsing the safelight and dome rotating to project scars, charging the final planetarium image. Sensory details like thunder-rarefied air and phosphorescing prints are selective, POV-biased toward trauma mapping, evolving causally with the storm's movement. Micro-setting of darkroom tools integrates action, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unmasking censored pain escalates texturally through density increases like blooming bruises and ash letters, with one meaningful deepening in the lightning projection forcing stance crystallization. Agency in renunciation (developing scars) forecloses forgetting with felt cost in the vibrating dome. Coherent pressure under Accumulative lens lands without coincidence resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of scars as legible weather emerges from images like boiling water constellations and ash stanzas, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final spoken line that reweights exile as belonging. Subtext in silences and implications avoids moralizing, with ambiguity in "masks slip" inviting reflection on identity's fluidity. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars without platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature in scar-focused noticing, like thunder syncing with timer. Prose texture in rhythmic, patterned diction teaches lyric compression early, paying off at closure without head-hopping. Spoken stanza carries subtext, advancing thematic reconfiguration; syntax reflects furiously tranquil state under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose density is high with multi-job sentences like "thunder rarefied the air," varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold. Figurative language coheres in scar-cartography motif, accelerating momentum in peak beats like lightning strike. No artifacts obscure closure; final line resolves by recharging motifs with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of photography, censorship, and storm as collaborator transforms trauma tropes through specific scar-mapping and ash-plane ingenuity. Risk in lyric mosaic heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise with non-obvious reconfiguration. Emotional specificity in "vigil in pause" avoids generics, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
