<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to outwit the tricksters is clear and rooted in her discoveries, intensifying through her broadcast with embodied tension like trembling fingers and bone-vibrating frequencies. Interiority shows contradictory impulses, such as hope masking terror, and her final self-sacrifice reveals a hierarchy of values with felt cost. However, some emotions lean toward summary labels, like "cautiously hopeful demeanor," slightly flattening peak moments without deeper embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages, from decoding signals to broadcasting interference, culminating in a decisive change where the entities veer away with legible cost of Mara's permanent enmity. Orientation anchors early in the radio station, and the single-POV, multi-shard structure fits Track B with legible transitions teaching the pattern of discovery and action. One meaningful tightening during the eclipse forces her stance crystallization effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The university radio station anchors spatially with tactile details like cramped space and aging equipment, constraining choices by providing perfect tools for subsonic interference. Astronomical charts recur as a micro-setting, constraining her realizations and charging the final update need. Sensory details, like static whispers and bone vibrations, are selective and POV-biased, evolving causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of exposing tricksters escalates causally through one meaningful tightening during the eclipse, narrowing options as entities fight back and forcing her sacrificial broadcast with visible cost. Pressure coheres under the causal lens, with internal fear conflicting with hope to create authentic tension. However, some stakes feel abstract until the climax, slightly diluting visceral escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of resisting manipulation through reason emerges organically from Mara's actions and the entities' dependence on eroded trust, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where humanity refuses to play. Subtext in cosmic voices' promises and her refusal invites reflection on altruism versus power. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing, embracing complexity in false dichotomies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-specific, with perceptual bias in Mara's scientific noticing of frequencies and charts. Prose texture distinct in rhythmic, urgent syntax during the broadcast, modulating with stress. Cosmic voices function as dialogue advancing plot via temptation, but some interiority uses filter verbs that mildly dull immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing through vivid images like "subsonic frequencies vibrate through her bones" without major loops, though some repetitive phrasing around divisions and charts creates minor template cadence. Rhythm varies naturally, supporting momentum, but occasional overwriting in descriptive stacks slightly muddles peak beats. No significant artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes cosmic horror with psychological manipulation in a fresh way, transforming tropes through Mara's radio-based interference and the entities' belief-feeding nature. Risk-taking in subsonic mechanics heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable via chart patterns. Emotional specificity in her altruism avoids generics, cohering as a singular vision.</comment>
