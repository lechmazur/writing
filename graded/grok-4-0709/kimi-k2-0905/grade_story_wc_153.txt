<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to seek an unspoken apology is clear and intensifies through embodied internal conflict, with contradictory impulses shown in the unsent letters and the hesitation at the seam; the final act of speaking "I'm sorry" earns a meaningful renunciation with visible cost in the healing drop and transformed letters. The medium applies secondary pressure as a crucible, forcing choices that alter the relational state. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, with emotions embodied in shaking breath and clenched lip.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and deepening motifs toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the corridor where the apology seeds, with felt conceptual cost in the released letters and healed wound; orientation anchors early in the mangrove labyrinth at dusk, waiving any penalty as disorientation serves the surreal payoff. One meaningful deepening suffices, with the shard's transformation narrowing options. Minor elision in the brother's frozen moment is motivated and pays off without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth is vividly sensory and purposeful, with salt-black water and knotted roots constraining movement and mirroring internal regret; it charges the final image where roots shift like fingers letting go, evolving causally to guide the path home. Atmosphere of fierce tenderness tensions the theme through tide-pool silver and singing spirits. Micro-setting like the shard functions as an extension, anchoring specificity without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of speaking the unspoken apology signals early and tightens through the journey's deepening imagery, culminating in agency-driven closure where uttering "I'm sorry" forecloses the path of silence with felt emotional cost in the seeded words and empty pockets. Pressure coheres accumulatively, with one reversal at the seam forcing stance crystallization. Moral calculus between cruelty as freedom and return sharpens the choice without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness and the space before deciding emerges organically from images like unsent letters turning to moths, offering a resonant, non-literal answer in the final reconfiguration without moralizing; subtext in gestures like the medium's kiss and the shard's glow invites reflection on regret's cost. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding sentimentality. The core concept integrates with particulars, reweighting the premise at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, biased noticing of moonlight sweat and root-lined air; voice texture in rhythmic, patterned diction teaches its lyric compression early and pays off at closure without head-hopping. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances the surreal plot, as in the medium's "Hold it toward the moon." Psychic distance shifts intentionally with emotional intensity, maintaining focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and syntactic variety accelerating through beats like the corridor merging, free of loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; every line advances atmosphere and character via concrete images like "paper lungs collapsed around verbs too sharp to inhale." Opening anchors voice in the breathing labyrinth, and the final line resolves by recharging motifs with the pulsing shard. No artifacts obscure clarity, even in peak surreal moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of mangrove spirits, transforming shards, and apology seams feels fresh and inevitable, transforming familiar regret tropes through specific, voice-driven details like letters as moths; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers a non-obvious angle on sibling rift, committing fully with emotional specificity. One fresh inflection in the seeded words reconfigures meaning organically.</comment>
