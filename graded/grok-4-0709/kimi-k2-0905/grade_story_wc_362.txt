<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to prove objects absorb emotions is rooted in grief and intensifies through embodied contradictions, like whispering lies while feeling the prism reject them; his final admission "I need you still" earns a resonant renunciation with visible emotional cost, repositioning his fracture like a set bone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of frost, lies, and light to a Conceptual Repricing closure where grief is released via the prism on the dashboard, with felt cost in the hairline fracture; orientation anchors early in the quartz arbor, but minor elision in the sister's death details slightly softens causal traceability without harming the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The quartz arbor in mist constrains Elian's communion, with crystalline branches and frost patterns charging choices and the final image; sensory details like the singing quartz and suspended dew evolve causally, mirroring his internal hush and refracting emotions vividly through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of communing with absorbed sorrow tightens through deepening lies and light ribbons, forcing stance crystallization under textural pressure; the prism's flare and frost mirrors narrow options with emotional cost legible in the cracking hush, though coincidence in mist lifting slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of objects absorbing and releasing emotions emerges organically from frost patterns and truthful lies, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights grief without moralizing; subtext in the prism's warmth and fracture invites lingering ambiguity on loss and communion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual signature in mystic, grounded noticing of mineral breath and frost braille; voice texture in rhythmic, image-dense prose modulates with pressure, teaching patterned elision that pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, propulsion-driven sentences like "the beam split into seven ribbons that painted the quartz trunks in bruised violets and urgent reds," varying rhythm purposefully; zero loops or artifacts, with metaphors coherent and voice-motivated throughout peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mysticism and object-emotion theory transforms grief tropes through specific frost braille and truthful lies, feeling inevitable in the prism's fracture; risk in lyric accumulation heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
