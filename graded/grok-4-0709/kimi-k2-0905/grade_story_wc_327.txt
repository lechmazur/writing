<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The copper-veined storyteller's motivation to preserve the dying language is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in fear of silence over personal curse, leading to her sacrificial transformation with embodied cost in the final beats. Interiority is concrete and contradictory, shown through her acceptance of the exchange ("one life for many voices"), revealing hierarchy of values where language outweighs self. The meaningful endurance forecloses her life path with visible, felt cost, turning her body into a vessel for continuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and echoes to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the storyteller's calcification, with clear conceptual cost of her death enabling language preservation. Orientation anchors who (storyteller), where (canyon tunnel), and when (post-river-tongue death) early, within the first paragraph. Closure lands on-page with the statue's completion and the heron's confirmation, reweighting silence into continuance, though causality is more poetic than strictly because/therefore.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The canyon with bone towers and tunnel of echoes is vividly specific, with sensory details like humming lament and textured air purposefully constraining choices, such as climbing into the spiral artery to harness echoes. Atmosphere builds a haunting, tactile world where environment mirrors internal stakes, charging the final image of the statue at the tunnel's center. Micro-setting of the diamond on the skull and feather cloth integrates action, evolving causally to project texture-sounds onto walls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving the river-tongue against silence and curse signals early and deepens through one meaningful intensification when she swallows the diamond, narrowing options to self-sacrifice with visible cost of calcification. Under Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates via echoing syllables and widening crack, forcing stance crystallization in the final beat. Agency in her renunciation forecloses life for language, with felt price charging the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of translating loss into continuance emerges organically from images like the diamond's crack and bone flutes, resisting tidy morals by embracing ambiguity in the curse's seepage as both doom and gift. Subtext in gestures like kissing the flaw and cupped palm invites reflection on sacrifice, with the final heron image offering a resonant, non-literal repricing of memory's cost. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding sentimentality in her quiet acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward tactile, auditory details like "taste the lost language’s grammar of textures," modulating rhythmically under pressure. Prose texture is distinct in lyrical syntax and patterned diction, teaching compression early and paying off at closure without elision issues. No dialogue present, so not evaluated; focalization controls time and space consistently, with purposeful uncertainty enhancing the mythic tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in sentences like "the curse did not rage; it seeped," advancing atmosphere and character without loops or artifacts. Information density shines in multi-job lines, such as the diamond's whisper blending with bone chords, free of overwriting or mixed metaphors. Final line resolves by recharging motifs like the heron, with flawless clarity and concision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing mythic elements like copper veins and bone towers into a fresh premise of linguistic preservation via bodily transformation, feeling inevitable through textured metaphors. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes of curses and echoes into a singular vision of continuance. The non-obvious angle on language death, with the statue's invitation to travelers, commits fully without hedging.</comment>
