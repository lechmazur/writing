<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The queen's motivation is clear and intensifies through embodied contradictions, like pressing forward despite the lacy menace stitching her lungs, revealing a hierarchy of values with felt cost in her acceptance of erasure; interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing, though secondary characters are absent, fitting the single-POV default without penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and cadence shifts, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where she accepts the loop with conceptual cost legible in the crown's weight as coronation and erasure; orientation anchors early with the queen at the grotto's edge, and the single continuous scene fits scope with one meaningful deepening at the obsidian shard revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto above clouds is vividly specific, with sensory details like frost on eyelashes and coppery air constraining choices and charging the final image of the crown settling; atmosphere evolves causally, mirroring internal paradox, and micro-setting of the dais directly shapes the closure without generic clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling the dream mystery signals early and tightens through textural density increase, like bleeding starlight pooling in palms, forcing stance crystallization with visible cost in her erasure; one meaningful deepening at realizing the loop's nature suffices, though coincidence in the dream's origin complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory's fragility and looped fate emerges organically through images like bleeding starlight as escaping memories, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer at the shared exhale that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in the paradox of forgiveness and betrayal enriches ambiguity, inviting reflection on choices as illusions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in selective, biased noticing, like tasting iron in endings; prose texture in rhythmic, patterned diction teaches lyric compression early, paying off at closure without head-hopping, and no dialogue present avoids evaluation there.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like the lacy menace wrapping lungs, free of loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, accelerating momentum in peak beats without muddle, though one mixed metaphor in "bleeding starlight pooled... warm as a child's fever" is a hairline slip not touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes time-loop prophecy with fresh inflection in memory as bleeding sky-wound, feeling inevitable through grounded imagery; risk-taking in lyric density heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming familiar fate tropes via specific details like the obsidian shard reflecting the dream itself.</comment>
