<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's kindly methodical nature is vividly embodied through concrete actions like transcribing Morse-like patterns and planting the seed, revealing contradictory impulses of determination against grief-fueled doubt; the final renunciation of literal return earns a poignant endurance with visible emotional cost in her laughter and realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and deepenings like the seed's sprouting and the arbor's resonance, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing closure where ambitions reconfigure as shape-shifting love with undeniable conceptual cost; orientation anchors early via the magnetic arbor setting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor's swaying boughs and iron leaves vividly constrain Mira's choices, such as transcribing clangs into cuneiform, while the mirrored sky charges the final image of the extending plank; sensory details like humming planks and clicking leaves are purposeful and POV-filtered, enhancing atmosphere without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake of reestablishing meaning amid grief tightens through deepenings like the seed's heat and the sprout's runes, driven by Mira's agency in humming and etching; emotional cost is unmistakable in her blurred eyes and velocity equation, reweighting options under the textural lens without coincidence resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of transition and haunted ambitions emerges organically from particulars like the seed's pulsing and the waveform presence, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer that reweights loss as love's velocity; subtext in silences and images invites lingering ambiguity without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in Mira's analogical translations and embodied perceptions; prose texture in rhythmic syntax and purposeful compression teaches patterns that pay off at closure, with mother's voice integrated subtextually without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with propulsion in lines like "love over time is velocity," varying rhythm naturally without loops or artifacts; figurative elements cohere, advancing atmosphere and character while maintaining clarity in peak beats like the bloom's folding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cuneiform translation with surreal elements like knowledge fruit and magnetic arbor feels inevitable, transforming grief tropes through specific risks like the silver sprout's runes that heighten emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
