<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Calyx's motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in duty conflicting with personal loss, shown through embodied hesitation before planting the seed; internal conflict manifests in contradictory impulses during the dream fissure moment, earning the renunciation with felt cost of forgetting her teacher's name.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Structure holds under Accumulative/Textural lens with strong orientation by the first paragraph and a resonant reconfiguration in the final image, where planting the seed reprices collective memory with conceptual cost; one meaningful deepening in the dream sequence tightens pressure without causality breaks, though minor elision in waking transition is taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ridge setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining Calyx's choices through eroding paths and monsoon threat, with sensory details like warm basalt and orchid glow filtered through her perceptual bias; the environment charges the final image by knitting petals and stones, mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of verifying the ridge escalates through dream deepening under textural lens, forcing stance crystallization with visible cost in memory loss; one meaningful tightening narrows options at the fissure, though coincidence of thunder complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of collective memory's fragility emerges organically from images and events, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer that doubt binds stronger than belief, reweighting the premise without moralizing; subtext in luminous doubt invites reflection through ambiguity, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in whimsical, metaphorical noticing; prose texture in rhythmic syntax and patterned diction teaches lyric compression early, paying off at closure without head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural, advancing through Elder Numa's greeting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally and avoiding loops or artifacts; figurative language like "dragon’s back" integrates without muddle, propelling momentum through selective, purposeful sentences; final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy verification with cultural memory feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific dream mechanics and doubt-as-binding; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise implications.</comment>
