<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The undertaker's weary stubbornness creates clear, contradictory impulses that drive his journey and culminate in an earned acceptance of tenure, with visible cost in tethering himself eternally; interiority is concrete and embodied, revealing values through micro-choices like folding paper boats from graveside memories.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and deepening mystical shards to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the undertaker accepts his role with conceptual cost, legible in the tethered moment and his name appearing in the book; orientation anchors early via the package and parlor, with no disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The underwater city library is vividly specific, with barnacled marble boulevards and brass octopus catalog constraining choices and charging the final image of the circulation desk; sensory details like silt-brushed feet and salt on lips evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of revitalizing the signal tightens through one meaningful deepening as the undertaker descends and repairs the lens, driven by agency with felt cost in perpetual tethering; pressure accumulates texturally via glowing shard and underwater fire, reweighting options without coincidence resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of rest's permanent address emerges organically through images like the flotilla of burning paper boats and surging signals, offering a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration in the final hush that calms waves; subtext in silences and implications avoids moralizing, embracing complexity with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, rhythmic prose that modulates with pressure, like the interval between heartbeats; patterned diction and syntax teach a lyric mode early, paying off legibly at closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, purposeful metaphors like books sighing shut and cold underwater fire, varying rhythm naturally without loops or artifacts; sentences propel momentum, integrating action and atmosphere cleanly, though occasional figurative stacking in descriptive beats slightly muddles under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of undertaker lore with surreal underwater library transforms tropes through specific mystical logic and bold risk in lyric structure, heightening stakes organically; the core premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with fresh inflections like memory-fueled conflagration charging the closure without gimmickry.</comment>
