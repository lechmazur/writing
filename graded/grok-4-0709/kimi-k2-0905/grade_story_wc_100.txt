<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The undertaker's weary stubbornness is consistently embodied in actions like refusing prior summons yet yielding to the shard's pull, revealing internal contradiction through his dream-induced conviction and final acceptance; however, emotional progression leans poetic rather than deeply contradictory in peak moments, with flaws complicating choices effectively but without raw hypocrisy under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through mosaic shards with legible transitions, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the undertaker accepts tenure with felt cost (tethered ankle, empty parlor); orientation anchors early via the package, and causality holds via motif accumulation without breaks, charging the final image of chased stillness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The underwater library setting is vividly specific, with barnacled marble boulevards and brass octopus catalog constraining choices like navigation and repair; sensory details like silt-brushed feet and salt on lips filter through POV bias, mirroring internal repose while charging the closure with environmental pressure on the lens bezel.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of revitalizing the signal escalates texturally through deepening motifs (shard glow, paper boats aflame), forcing stance crystallization in accepting keeper role with visible cost (tethered ankle, forsaken parlor); one meaningful intensification suffices, driven by agency without coincidence resolving, though secondary stakes like unpaid debts feel braided but not fully converged.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of rest's permanent address emerges organically from images like breathing books and returned souls, resisting tidy morals via ambiguity in the undertaker's self-burial; subtext in gestures like the maternal click and final hush elicits lingering reflection, with the ending image offering resonant repricing of mortality without assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual signature in selective noticing (e.g., salt on lips, pulse in glass), modulating rhythm under pressure like the underwater conflagration; no dialogue present, so policy skips; purposeful compression in lyric mode teaches patterns early, paying off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose density is high with vivid, propulsion-driven sentences like "pages of compacted salt unfurled into corridors," varying rhythm naturally without loops or artifacts; metaphors cohere (e.g., fire feeding on memory), advancing atmosphere concisely, though occasional elevated diction fits the voice without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes undertaker lore with surreal underwater library in a non-obvious way, transforming tropes through specific motifs like the brass octopus and memory-fueled fire; risk in lyric boldness heightens thematic stakes, feeling inevitable via motif callbacks without gimmickry or echoes.</comment>
