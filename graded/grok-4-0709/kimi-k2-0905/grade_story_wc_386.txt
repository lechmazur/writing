<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marrow's motivation to salvage purity is clear and intensifies through dream-driven choices, with embodied emotions like skin sticking to ice revealing internal conflict under pressure. Her trait of weaving truth carefully constrains actions, enabling the climax without stock epiphanies. Flaws, such as guarded expressions, complicate her hierarchy of values, culminating in an earned unguarded smile at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the mosaic structure builds through dream shards with legible transitions, landing a Resonant Reconfiguration via the salvaged globe and conceptual repricing of wreckage as light-cradling. Orientation anchors early in the S.S. Caldera dive, with deliberate disorientation paying off in the shrine revelations. One meaningful deepening suffices, though causality feels more pattern-based than strict linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The glacier setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices like following air pockets and charging the final mirror image with borrowed starlight. Sensory details, filtered through Marrow's POV, evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. The shrine's ice walls and cold-burning candles pressure actions, meeting the 9+ test by shaping the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of salvaging purity tightens through the shrine analysis and corridor pursuit, with agency in Marrow's decisions driving a meaningful deepening under the textural lens. Cost is felt in the glacier's closing and passengers' dissolution, though coincidence in the globe's appearance slightly complicates without resolving. Escalation forces stance crystallization at the heart, with visible trade-offs charging the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of connections across memories emerges organically from images like cameo faces and swirling globes, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the tapestry's pattern. Subtext in silences and projections invites reflection, culminating in a resonant final image repricing wreckage without statement. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, selective noticing, like crevasse-blue ice, holding under pressure without head-hopping. Voice texture in rhythmic syntax and purposeful compression teaches patterns early, paying off at closure. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation there.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and syntactic variety accelerating through dives, free of loops or artifacts; metaphors like "glacier groaned like a sleeping whale" cohere without muddle. Information density advances atmosphere and character in every line, meeting the 9+ test with zero scaffold and clear propulsion. Final line resolves by recharging motifs like borrowed starlight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost-whispering dives and dream cameos feels inevitable, transforming tropes like haunted wrecks through specific surreal elements like melted globes. Risk-taking in mosaic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, cohering as a singular vision. Fresh inflection in the self-reflective globe reconfigures the premise boldly.</comment>
