<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation evolves from ambition to gratitude through concrete, scent-driven interiority, with contradictory impulses embodied in her careful grafting and emotional release; the mother's silent encounter heightens relational pressure, revealing values with felt cost in the final renunciation of chasing serenity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and reflections to a resonant reconfiguration where serenity becomes a companion, with conceptual cost legible in the notebook's offering; orientation anchors early via the rope bridge and estuary, and one meaningful deepening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The treetop village and estuary setting constrain choices through sway and scents, charging the final image of descent with wildflower hush; sensory details, filtered by olfactory sensitivity, mirror internal states without overt symbolism, evolving causally with the graft.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grafting for serenity tightens through the stitch and scent shift, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in loosened ambition; under Textural lens, cadence deepens once meaningfully, though coincidence of mother's appearance slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of serenity within motion emerges organically from grafting and family customs, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights ambition without moralizing; subtext in scents and doodles invites ambiguity, earning wisdom through specific struggles like the olfactory storm.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in olfactory bias and rhythmic prose that modulates with pressure; patterned diction teaches lyric compression early, paying off at closure without head-hopping, and minimal dialogue fits naturally if present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, multi-job sentences like “seed breathes; tide thinks; I must move without disturbing either,” varying rhythm purposefully; no loops or artifacts obscure closure, and figurative language coheres without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of herbalism, family customs, and scent-haunted spirits transforms familiar nature motifs through specific olfactory worldview; risk in lyric structure heightens thematic stakes, feeling inevitable in the graft's success and serenity's companionship.</comment>
