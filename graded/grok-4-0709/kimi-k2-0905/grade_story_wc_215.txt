<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alden's motivation to preserve unspoken words intensifies compellingly through his ritual and the child's ghost encounter, culminating in an earned endurance that forecloses escape with felt isolation cost; interiority is concrete via embodied perceptions like chest pressure, avoiding stock epiphanies. Ghosts as secondary figures apply subtle pressure without overwhelming the single-POV focus. Minor slip in archetypal recluse traits slightly flattens individuality, but micro-choices under pressure reveal value hierarchy effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned shards of ritual and ghost encounters with legible transitions, anchoring orientation early in the oasis wasteland; closure lands as Earned Stasis with conceptual cost in Alden's whispered vow, reweighting the covenant via the blooming scent. One meaningful deepening at the child's pouring intensifies knowledge without requiring causal turns. Orientation is clear by 120 words, waiving any penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The scorched wasteland and apiary ruins constrain Alden's choices, with ash spirals and hive shells mirroring internal burden, charging the final image of blooming clover; sensory details like soot motes and honey hush are selective, POV-biased, and evolve causally. Micro-setting of the stained glass box functions as environment, directly shaping the closure by sealing the fracture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving the covenant tightens through the child's ghost deepening the parchment's weight, forcing stance crystallization in the dream and final vow under Accumulative lens; cost is felt in chest pressure and broken silence, with agency in renunciation foreclosing departure. One meaningful cadence shift suffices, though coincidence of ghosts complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of silent guardianship emerges organically from images of unspoken words and ghosts, resisting tidy morals via ambiguity in the covenant's unraveling risk; final image of sealed box and blooming scent offers resonant, non-literal repricing of isolation's sweetness without statement. Subtext in mute postures and contextual clues enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person maintains stable close distance with perceptual signature in tranquil observations, like wind-carried ash; prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, patterned diction that teaches lyric compression early, paying off at closure without head-hopping. Sole dialogue line feels natural, subtextual, advancing the vow. Non-standard phrasing is voice-motivated and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, multi-job sentences like "motes of soot emerged, drifting like disappointed bees," varying rhythm purposefully; no loops or artifacts obscure closure, with strong verbs and specific nouns propelling momentum. Figurative language integrates without muddle, enhancing propulsion in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of beekeeping ghosts and unspoken words transforms post-apocalyptic recluse trope through specific covenant logic and mute eloquence, heightening stakes via the box's fracture risk; final reconfiguration feels inevitable from patterned clues. Minor familiarity in wasteland isolation holds back higher ingenuity.</comment>
