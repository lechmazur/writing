<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alden's motivation to preserve unspoken words is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in his traits and leading to an earned endurance with felt cost in breaking his silence; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in his dream of unraveling versus his choice to stay and mend. The single-POV focus excels in revealing character through micro-choices under pressure, like pressing the fracture. Weakness lies in a slightly archetypal recluse without deeper flaws complicating choices mid-story.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern breaks building to a Resonant Reconfiguration in Earned Stasis, where Alden's vow seals the fracture with visible cost in his broken silence and the ghosts' response; orientation anchors early in the oasis wasteland. One meaningful deepening occurs with the child's ghost, tightening the covenant's pressure. Minor slip in reflective blocks slightly exceeding BRR without full interleaving, but they anchor and tilt stance effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The scorched wasteland and abandoned beekeeping oasis are vividly specific, with sensory details like ash spirals and hive ruins constraining Alden's choices and charging the final image of blooming clover scent; atmosphere mirrors his tranquil perception through mute eloquence. Details evolve causally, integrating into action like the box in the hive shell. Environment as micro-setting heightens the covenant's stakes without ornamental excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving the covenant tightens meaningfully with the child's ghost, forcing stance crystallization in Alden's choice to stay, with felt cost in his chest pressure and vow-breaking; under Accumulative lens, pattern break reweights options via bees of light dissolving. Agency in renunciation forecloses leaving, with moral calculus between holding words or scattering them. Coherent pressure builds without coincidence resolving, though stakes remain somewhat abstract until closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of preserving unspoken words amid silence and loss emerges organically through images like the parchment and ghosts, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer in the final blooming scent that reweights the wasteland's premise without moralizing. Subtext in gestures and implications, like the child's posture, invites reflection on covenants as combs holding sweetness. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality via concrete particulars, with purposeful ambiguity in the fracture's lie-like propagation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature in tranquil observations, like wind-carried ash resembling bees; prose texture is purposeful and rhythmic, modulating with pressure in short, charged sentences at climax. Single line of dialogue at the end feels natural and goal-driven, breaking silence to advance the covenant. Patterned diction teaches lyric compression early, paying off legibly at closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and syntactic variety accelerating in peak moments like the child's word-pouring; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, like "hush heavier than honey," without muddle or loops. Zero scaffold or artifacts, high information density advancing atmosphere and character per line. Final line resolves by recharging motifs like the desert flowering, with clean grammar and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghosts, beekeeping metaphors, and unspoken words feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric structure heightening stakes through mute eloquence; premise transforms familiar recluse trope via specific covenant and perceptual details. Originality in conceptual integrity, committing to implications without retreat, as in the fracture propagating like a lie. Bold, non-obvious angle on silence and preservation avoids templates.</comment>
