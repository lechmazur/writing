<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rowan's motivation is clear and intensifies through doubt and discovery, rooted in his mentor's loss, with embodied emotions like his irregular heartbeat and doubt hissing like thawing steel; interior conflict shows in his hesitation with gears, leading to an earned renunciation of past flaws. The single-POV focus excels in character-specific interiority without stock phrasing, though secondary characters are absent, fitting scope. Flaws complicate choices authentically, culminating in the healed key moment that reveals his value hierarchy with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Structure holds under Accumulative/Textural lens with patterned elision of mirrors building to a resonant reconfiguration in the workshop, where the door vanishing reprices repair with conceptual cost of isolation yet acceptance. Orientation anchors early in the frozen library, with one continuous scene fitting scope. Causality flows through motivated discoveries, like noticing unsynchronized reflections, earning the closure without coincidences resolving it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The frozen library above clouds constrains choices vividly, with crystal floors and auroras integrated into action, like boots squealing and frost beading on the door; sensory details are selective and POV-biased, mirroring Rowan's urgency. The hall of mirrors charges the final image by healing the key, evolving causally without static repetition. Micro-setting of gears and key functions as environment, guiding the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of learning repair's rhythm tightens through the mirrors' revelation, deepening via the healed key that forecloses doubt with felt emotional cost. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern break in reflections forces stance crystallization without coincidence resolving. Agency in aligning the key drives escalation, though only one meaningful deepening fits length without multiple reversals required.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness and repair emerges organically from mirrors storing better versions and the mentor's workshop, reweighting the premise in the final image without stated moral. Subtext in reflections mocking hope invites reflection on loss, with emotional honesty avoiding sentimentality. Resonance arises from particulars like the healed key, offering a non-literal answer to mending irregularity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Rowan's biased noticing of gears and frost, syntax rhythmic and voice-motivated in poetic compression. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; patterned diction teaches lyric mode early, paying off at closure. Psychic distance shifts intentionally with emotional intensity, like doubt hissing, without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like "boots squealing on crystal floors" advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere, such as mirrors as frozen wave, heightening pressure. No artifacts obscure closure; information density high, with lines multitasking image and advancement. Syntactic variety supports emphasis, and final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmithing with eclipses and mirrors transforms fantasy tropes through specific emotional truth of grief and repair, feeling inevitable in the healed key moment. Risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise without retreat. No close echoes of famous scenes; originality in hall storing discarded drafts elevates ingenuity.</comment>
