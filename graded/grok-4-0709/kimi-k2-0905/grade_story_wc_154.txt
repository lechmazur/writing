<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to translate and heal wounds is clear and intensifies through embodied emotions, with contradictory impulses shown in the confession of the mistranslated market leading to massacre. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, as seen in the pulse stutter under anesthetic that reveals guilt. The boy's shrewd innocence applies pressure, forcing micro-choices like voicing symbols that earn the final shared scar with visible cost. Flaws like translation failures complicate choices without hedging, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered decryption and imagery toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where anxieties shift to sediment for growth, with felt cost in the lighter coral and lotus-hearted ache holding dew. Orientation anchors early in the anesthetic and mist-clad atrium, waiving any penalty. One meaningful deepening suffices, with the boy's tap on the coral as a pattern break reweighting knowledge. Minor ellipsis in backstory feels motivated but slightly softens causality at edges.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is vividly specific, with droplets on banana leaves mirroring failed interpretations and constraining the intimate decryption beat. Sensory details like fogged breath and hot fingers are purposeful, filtered through the narrator's bias, and evolve causally with thickening mist shrinking the world. The setting charges the final image of the aligned coral and cast growing from the sea, meeting the 9+ test by constraining choices. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake of grafting meaning onto wounds tightens through one meaningful deepening in decrypting the cast, narrowing options and forcing confession with felt cost in the shared birthday scar. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens via density increase in symbols like the spiral, culminating in stance crystallization. Agency in voicing knots forecloses inward ache for outward opening, with coincidence in the boy's tap complicating but not resolving. The cost is legible but could be more viscerally tied to a foreclosed path for higher escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of translation as healing emerges organically from coral motifs and smudged notes, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in collective guilt and memory's helices. Subtext in gestures like the boy's tap and whispered "stay" invites reflection on shared anxieties without confusion. The final image of dew instead of blood offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of trauma, meeting the 9+ test. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars like ink diluted by tears.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in cordite-tasting apologies and whorled anxieties, modulating rhythm under morphine's softening. Dialogue in coastal dialect feels natural, goal-driven with subtext in "unknot them" pursuing decryption. Prose texture in syntactic variety reflects the focalizer's mind, with purposeful compression in mist-swallowed world taught early and paid off. Meets 9+ test with rhythmic control and no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in droplet clicks and echoing footsteps advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like watercolor grays and corkscrew memory is coherent, high-density, and voice-motivated in peak beats like the confession. Clarity shines in concise sentences doing multiple jobs, such as the coral's grooves aligning perfectly to charge closure. Zero artifacts touch the ending, meeting the 9+ test with strong verbs and no muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise of a translator decrypting a child's cast as confession offers fresh synthesis of conflict-zone guilt and reef memory, transforming tropes through specific details like shrapnel-eyed innocence. Risk in lyric density heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the dew-held ache. Voice coheres as singular, with the coral motif constraining choices organically. Minor familiarity in healing arcs caps at this level despite strong ingenuity.</comment>
