<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to translate and heal wounds is concretely rooted in guilt and embodied through tactile interactions like pressing the coral, with contradictory impulses shown in the confession of the mistranslated market; the boy's shrewd innocence pressures choices without stereotype, though secondary characters like Dr. Lam remain off-page and underutilized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered realizations in one continuous atrium scene, with orientation anchored by the anesthetic and field hospital by ~50 words; closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing where shared anxieties shift to sediment for growth, with felt cost in the lotus-hearted ache, though ellipsis in the boy's morphine drift slightly softens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight constrains and mirrors the narrator's foggy introspection, with sensory details like dripping droplets and fogged breath charging the final image of the aligned coral and cast; micro-setting of the cast and coral as tools evolves causally, heightening atmospheric specificity without overload.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grafting meaning onto wounds tightens through decrypting the cast, forcing a deepening realization of collective guilt with visible cost in the sternum ache opening outward; agency in voicing symbols crystallizes stance under textural pressure, though coincidence of the birthday match complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of translation as healing emerges organically from coral motifs and smudged notes, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights trauma as potential growth without moralizing; subtext in the spiral and fish symbols invites ambiguity, avoiding sentimentality through embodied contradictions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, sensory-biased noticing, like cordite taste and ridges like braille; dialogue in dialect carries subtext and advances decryption, with rhythmic control heightening under morphine haze without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose density is high with purposeful rhythm in dripping syllables and varying syntax, free of loops or artifacts; figurative language like "lotus-hearted ache" integrates without muddle, propelling toward closure, though occasional elevated diction borders on overwriting in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of coral as memory vessel and translation as unknotting transforms familiar war guilt tropes into a non-obvious helix of growth, with risk in lyric compression heightening stakes; the boy's tap on the coral feels inevitable, charging the premise without gimmickry.</comment>
