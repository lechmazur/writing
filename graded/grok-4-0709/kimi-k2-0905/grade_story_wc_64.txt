<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mercy's motivation to uncover the dead's intentions is clear and intensifies through her discoveries, rooted in her gardener traits and family history, compelling her to excavate the root cellar. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with trembling fingers and swelling echoes revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. The final renunciation of her surface role feels earned with a visible cost of sealing the world above, though secondary characters are absent, fitting the single-POV default without penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds with patterned elisions and motif build-up leading to a resonant reconfiguration in the subterranean room, where Mercy reprices her role as keeper with the conceptual cost of infinite guardianship. Orientation anchors early in the cemetery gloom, and causality flows through discoveries without breaks, with the coin's pulse and map guiding motivated ellipsis. Closure lands on-page with the soft metallic kiss and seed untangling, charging the final image under the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The cemetery and cobalt silo settings are vivid and purposeful, with moonlight, starlight, and preserved apples constraining choices and charging the closure; the silo’s tapestry and skylight integrate into action, mirroring internal echoes. Sensory details are selective and POV-biased, evolving causally from velveteen gloom to subterranean lamplight. The micro-setting of the tapestry and spade directly shapes the inciting find and climax excavation, meeting the 9+ test by constraining the final descent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake of discovering intentions escalates through accumulative deepenings like decoding the tapestry and map, tightening to a meaningful reconfiguration with the felt cost of sealing her old life. Pressure coheres under the textural lens, with one key deepening at the drawer reveal narrowing options to excavation. Agency drives the closure through her spade choice, though coincidence in the coin's find complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory outwaging oblivion emerges organically from images like the spiral coin and seed packets, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer as Mercy becomes the keeper, reweighting prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext in frayed threads and breathing tapestry invites reflection on hidden intentions. Emotional aftereffect arises from the charged poise of infinite chess, embracing complexity without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature in gardener-biased noticing of ivy, soil, and seeds, modulating rhythm from humming blitheness to trembling urgency. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax and rhythm, teaching patterned diction early and paying off at closure. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally in velveteen gloom and spade digs, advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "uncharted echoes flutter through her ribs" is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Information propulsion is strong, with final line recharging motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes cemetery guardianship with wartime hidden refugees in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming chess and spiral motifs through Mercy's specific choices. Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the root cellar reveal. Originality shines in the cobalt silo as a repurposed missile shaft, cohering as a singular vision.</comment>
