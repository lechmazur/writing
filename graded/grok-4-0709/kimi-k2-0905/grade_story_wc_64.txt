<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mercy's motivation to uncover the dead's intentions is clear and intensifies through her discoveries, rooted in her blithe yet tenderly organized traits shown via actions like decoding threads. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with emotions like trembling fingers revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. The final renunciation of her old role earns a meaningful change with felt cost, as she becomes the keeper, foreclosing surface-world paths. Relationships are absent, so no penalty there.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned discoveries with motivated ellipsis, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Mercy reweights her role with undeniable conceptual cost in the final image. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first paragraph, with no disorientation debt. Single POV and continuous scene fit defaults, with one meaningful deepening via the map revelation narrowing options. Cost is legible in her sealing the surface world, shaping the resonant ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The cemetery and cobalt silo are vividly specific, with sensory details like starlight dripping and preserved apples filtered through Mercy's POV, constraining choices like climbing the ladder. Atmosphere of velveteen gloom supports the tone, evolving causally as she digs. The silo and tapestry function as micro-settings that charge the final image of seed packets. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, with no inconsistencies.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering intentions signals early and tightens once through the tapestry decoding, deepening knowledge under the Accumulative lens with a cadence shift at the drawer reveal. Pressure coheres via echoes and bells, forcing stance crystallization in her descent with felt cost of sealing the world. No multiple reversals required; one meaningful deepening suffices, though coincidence of finding the case complicates without resolving. Agency in pressing the coin and digging earns the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory outwaging oblivion emerges organically from images like the spiral coin and seed packets, with subtext in frayed threads implying hidden intentions. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by repricing Mercy's role without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars like preserved apples, embracing complexity. No thematic statements; resonance builds through events.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with perceptual signature in poetic noticing like "uncharted echoes flutter through her ribs," modulating rhythm under pressure. Prose texture is distinct, with purposeful syntax and diction teaching a lyric pattern paid off at closure. No dialogue, so no evaluation there; no head-hopping or elision issues. Narrative certainty matches her knowledge, with no unwarranted withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally in sentences like "starlight drips through the skylight," advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, with no muddle in peak beats like the decoding. Clarity is strong, with strong verbs and specific details propelling momentum to the resonant end. Zero artifacts touch closure, passing the ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes cemetery gardening with hidden war history and geometric ciphers in a fresh, non-obvious way, feeling inevitable through Mercy's choices. Tropes like buried secrets are transformed via specific details like the chess-playing skeletons tapestry. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, cohering as a singular vision. No derivative echoes; ingenuity in the spiral motif charges the closure.</comment>
