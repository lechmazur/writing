<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marisol's motivation for rebellion is clear and rooted in her sensory wisdom, driving concrete actions like planting the seed with embodied emotion and contradictory impulses in her gentle yet defiant choices; interiority shines in tasting memories that reveal self-knowledge, earning the endurance of her resolve with felt cost in risking Ministry torches.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and scents to a Resonant Reconfiguration at dawn, with conceptual cost in transformed perceptions; orientation anchors early in the greenhouse during alignment, and one meaningful deepening via the seed's sprouting pays off without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse constrains and enables choices, supplying rust flakes and broken glass that integrate into action, charging the final image of transformation; sensory details like scents of cakes and plums are vivid, POV-filtered, and evolve causally, mirroring Marisol's internal hope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><grade>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates through celestial timing and Ministry threats, tightening once via the seed's pop and vine growth that reweights stakes; dominant stake of rebellion escalates with visible cost in blood and risk, forcing stance crystallization without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of beauty from decay emerges organically through images like pruning failures into futures, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in borrowed memories; subtext in scents and synaptic shifts invites reflection, culminating in a resonant final image that reprices nostalgia as treason without stating it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person is stable with perceptual signature in Marisol's taste-based wisdom, diction rhythmic and voice-motivated in lyric compression; no dialogue, but prose texture distinct, with purposeful elision taught early and paid off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in sentences like "vines rose fast as clock hands spinning backward" accelerating momentum; zero loops or artifacts, high information density in multi-job lines, and metaphors coherent without muddle, especially in peak alignment beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthetic memory-tasting and synaptic rebellion transforms familiar dystopian tropes through specific details like ash from cookbooks, feeling inevitable; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
