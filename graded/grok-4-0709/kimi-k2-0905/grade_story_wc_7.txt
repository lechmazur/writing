<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marisol's motivation as a gentle rebel is clear and intensifies through her actions, rooted in concrete traits like tasting memories, with embodied emotions in lines like pressing her tongue to glass revealing ambition and hope. Interior conflict shows in her self-knowledge when feeding the sprout her blood, balancing resolve with vulnerability. The meaningful change—transforming the greenhouse and sparking collective memory—earns its cost through her risks against the Ministry, with flaws like theft complicating choices without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and scents toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the transformed greenhouse and changed citizens, with felt cost in Marisol's ongoing rebellion. Orientation anchors early with the greenhouse and celestial alignment by ~50 words. One meaningful deepening occurs as the seed sprouts and vines grow, reweighting stakes with conceptual cost of unauthorized nostalgia as treason.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse anchors vividly as micro-setting, constraining choices like kneeling in rust flakes and using broken glass, while evolving causally with vines polishing copper bones. Sensory details like scents of birthday cakes and sour plums are selective, POV-filtered through Marisol's chef bias, mirroring her internal hope amid decay. The environment charges the final image of vines spilling out, constraining the closure by supplying the rebellion's medium.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of gentle rebellion signals early with stealing the seed, tightening once through the alignment's seven-breath countdown, forcing the planting under pressure. Deepening via synaptic plasticity reweights options, with visible cost in Marisol's blood and the Ministry's arrival. Agency in pruning and harvesting crystallizes stance, though coincidence of workers finding the fruit complicates without fully resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of beauty from decay emerges organically through images like pruning dead stems into edible scripture, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in borrowed memories' ethics. Subtext in scents and tastes implies rewiring without direct statement, inviting reflection on collective nostalgia. The final image of Marisol planning more seeds offers a resonant, non-literal answer to rebellion's cost, reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual price.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stays stable and character-bound, with perceptual signature in Marisol's taste-based noticing, like the seed pulsing like a heart. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, metaphorical syntax that modulates with intensity, teaching patterned elision early for lyric effect. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; elision pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in lines like "vines rose fast as clock hands spinning backward" advancing atmosphere and character without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, heightening pressure in peak beats like the seed splitting with a soft pop. Zero artifacts obscure closure; information density high, with every sentence layering image, action, and theme.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of culinary memory-tasting with sci-fi rebellion feels inevitable through specifics like synaptic plasticity via aromas, transforming tropes of forbidden knowledge into organic, voice-driven ingenuity. Risk in dense metaphor heightens stakes without gimmickry, as in the greenhouse's transformation charging the closure. No derivative echoes; authenticity coheres in bold, singular vision of beauty as decay's offshoot.</comment>
