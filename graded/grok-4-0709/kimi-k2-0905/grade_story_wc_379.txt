<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to prove listening heals is clear and intensifies through concrete choices like using the borescope then renouncing tools, with interior contradictions embodied in her shift from investigation to presence; the final renunciation earns stasis with felt conceptual cost of absorbing unsaid things; neighbors apply secondary pressure effectively without overwhelming the single-POV focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under accumulative/textural lens, orientation anchors early in the courtyard at dawn; structure builds through rumor shards with legible transitions, culminating in resonant reconfiguration where the mystery is absorbed with conceptual cost legible in the courtyard's expanded space; one meaningful deepening via collective silence suffices for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The courtyard's mosaics, fountain, and dawn light are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Mira's curator bias to constrain choices like sitting in silence; it charges the final image of the empty cushion and offerings, evolving causally with events without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of witnessing the mailbox mystery tightens accumulatively through gathered stories, forcing stance crystallization in renunciation with visible cost of unsaid things released; agency in Mira's micro-choices like offering tea deepens pressure once, sufficient for length, though secondary stakes remain understated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of listening as healing emerges organically from particulars like the locket's pulse merging with courtyard sounds, offering resonant non-literal answer in the final image of the empty cushion without moralizing; subtext in silences and implications invites reflection with purposeful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature in Mira's dust-settling sensations and curator instincts; prose texture rhythmic and purposeful, modulating with emotional intensity; no dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation, but narrative voice coherent without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, no loops or scaffold, high information density in lines like "objects return to stories, not places"; figurative language consistent and voice-motivated without muddle, accelerating in peak beats like the collective listening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystery and listening in a thrift curator's world feels inevitable, transforming tropes like vanished figures through specific courtyard accumulation; risk in quiet, conceptual closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, cohering as singular vision.</comment>
