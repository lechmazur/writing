<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to prove listening's healing power intensifies compellingly through micro-choices like shifting from tools to presence, with embodied emotions in her "dust between her ribs" and final chest-click realization. Interior conflict shows in her curator instincts flaring against the box's refusal to open, earning the stasis with felt cost of absorbed mystery. Flaws like persistence complicate choices without hedging, and her perceptual limits drive the neighborhood's collective witnessing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through rumor shards and storytelling overlaps, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the mystery absorbs into the courtyard with undeniable conceptual cost of unsaid things accommodated. Orientation anchors early in the rose-gold courtyard at dawn with Mira unlocking the gate. One meaningful deepening suffices, as tales accumulate to reweight listening over answers, though ellipsis between days slightly softens causality without breaking the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The vibrant courtyard at dawn is vividly specific with cool mosaics, fountain, and desert breeze, constraining choices like sitting cross-legged and charging the final image of the enlarged space for unsaid things. Sensory details filter through Mira's bias, evolving causally from hush to waking cracks, mirroring her internal shift. Environment pressures the collective silence, heightening atmosphere without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving listening heals tightens accumulatively through gathered tales and the pulse's merge with daily sounds, forcing stance crystallization in silent witnessing with felt cost of the box's absorbed mystery. One deepening via the borescope-to-presence shift narrows options, interweaving internal want (answers) with need (witnessing). Pressure coheres without coincidence resolving, though stakes remain more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of listening as healing emerges organically from particulars like the locket's pulse and collective silence, culminating in a resonant final image of the empty cushion without stated moral. Subtext in gestures like offerings and the courtyard's expansion invites ambiguity on grief's absorption. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete complexity, reweighting the premise via Mira's sandstorm calm.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stays stable with Mira's perceptual signature in curator-filtered details like "objects return to stories," and rhythmic prose modulates with pressure, as in the hushed fountain. Voice texture is distinct and purposeful, with patterned diction teaching lyric compression early. No head-hopping or elision issues, and subtext-rich whispers advance the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose propels with high density and varied rhythm, as in the opening's rose-gold glow to dusk's swallow, free of loops or artifacts; metaphors like "dust between her ribs" cohere without muddle. Sentences advance atmosphere and character, with strong verbs and purposeful syntax accelerating beats like the pulse's lub-dub. Final line recharges motifs impeccably, integrating ingenuity without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystery via accumulative rumors and listening transforms trope of vanished figure into a non-literal healing premise, with bold risk in quiet, collective closure heightening stakes organically. Perspective feels memorable through Mira's curator worldview, avoiding generics with specifics like the borescope and milk tooth offering. Core angle on witnessing over opening commits fully without hedging.</comment>
