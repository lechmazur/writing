<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his promise to Mira, intensifying through precognitive visions that compel his rock-placing actions with felt emotional cost. Interiority is concrete and particular, showing contradictory impulses like helpless witnessing versus active surrender, embodied in his touch of the eel that dissolves. The final renunciation of understanding for witnessing earns stasis with visible cost, though secondary characters like Mira are off-page and thus not evaluated for relational pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern-building through rock sequences leading to resonant reconfiguration at the end, where the star dust eruption and eel return reweight the promise with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors who (Elias), where (tidal bluff), and when (post-friction world under aurora) by ~50 words, waiving any penalty. Single continuous scene fits defaults, with one meaningful deepening via the singing dust and light equations; closure lands on-page with CR as patterns consume creators, though causality is more poetic than strict linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tidal bluff under aurora constrains choices, with slick rocks and absent friction enabling impossible steps that charge Elias's stability and the eels' aerial return in the final image. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, filtered through Elias's POV, like the pouch's pulsing heat and singing dust, mirroring internal surrender. Micro-setting of rocks and star dust evolves causally, pressuring the sequence and charging closure without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of fulfilling the promise tightens through accumulative deepening as rocks resonate and curse lifts, forcing stance crystallization with emotional cost of witnessing Mira's pattern in death. One meaningful cadence shift via dust eruption narrows options, reweighting knowledge under textural lens; agency in placing rocks drives escalation without coincidence resolving. Moral calculus between understanding and surrender sharpens the peak, though cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of surrendering to sacred patterns emerges organically from Elias's actions and eels' migration, culminating in non-literal final image where promise breaks via understanding, reweighting premise with ambiguity. Subtext in spaces between knowledge and Mira's words invites reflection on absence and geometry without tidy morals. Recurring motifs like spirals constrain choices and charge closure, avoiding token symbolism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with distinct perceptual signature, biased toward mathematical and auroral imagery, modulating rhythm under pressure like fragmented thoughts during rock placement. Prose texture is purposeful with lyric compression, teaching patterned elision early (e.g., friction's absence) and paying off at closure without head-hopping. No dialogue present, so not evaluated; psychic distance shifts intentionally serve emotional beats, with consistent voice avoiding register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with varied rhythm and syntax, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "shimmering equations written in light" without loops or scaffold. Clarity and concision propel momentum, with strategic figurative language consistent and payoff-driven, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the dust eruption. Zero artifacts, strong verbs, and purposeful paragraph structure support propulsion, though some metaphors border on dense without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surreal elements like frictionless world and aerial eels transforms familiar loss motifs through specific precognitive curse and mathematical sequences, feeling inevitable at closure. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise implications like eels trailing light. Avoids tropes via grounded emotional complexity, though core premise echoes speculative fiction without full novelty.</comment>
