<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maris's motivation is clear and intensifies through her investigation of gaps, rooted in her traits as a vigilant keeper, with embodied emotions like the humming in her bones and contradictory impulses in releasing the flower despite its cost; interiority is concrete, showing her isolation and flaws without stock phrasing, and the final renunciation forecloses borrowed memories with a felt cost of her own recollections draining away.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The structure accumulates texturally through observed gaps leading to a resonant reconfiguration when Maris releases the Edelweiss, closing anomalies with a legible conceptual cost in memory loss; orientation anchors early with nautical twilight and the opal dock, and the inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds without ambiguity, with the final image reweighting the premise of borrowed memories.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The opal dock in mist is vividly specific, with sensory details like tide slapping pilings and mist catching light like milk stirred with silver, filtered through Maris's POV; the setting constrains choices, as the mist blurs boundaries and enables the stranger's reappearance, charging the final image where the dock gleams like a closed eye.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake of decoding the stranger's gesture escalates through accumulating anomalies like missing gulls and ferry horn, deepening via Maris's agency in observing gaps, culminating in a stance crystallization when she releases the flower; cost is felt in the draining memories, though coincidence in the mist's persistence slightly complicates without fully resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of borrowed memories and filling gaps emerges organically through images like the Edelweiss carrying alpine sun and the log entry, inviting reflection on isolation without tidy morals; the final image of the lamp turning without ticking offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of time and memory, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in Maris's vigilant noticing of absences, like gaps in tide rhythm; prose texture is purposeful with rhythmic syntax mirroring mist's persistence, and patterned elision in anomalies teaches the accumulative lens, paying off at closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like "boots clanging, the sound swallowed by mist" advancing atmosphere and momentum; no loops or artifacts, with strong verbs and specific imagery propelling the narrative, though one mixed metaphor ("humming in her bones the way fog hums in a bell") is hairline and doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lighthouse isolation with borrowed memories and temporal gaps feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like the Edelweiss's glacier wind scent; risk in the poetic, accumulative structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, offering a fresh angle on memory and absence.</comment>
