<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to map collective grief is clear and rooted in her traits as a thoughtful carver, intensifying through resonant choices like tying the ribbon to the tree. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in her fierce meditation amid spectral guidance, culminating in an earned stasis where she accepts grief's ongoing carve into the world. The family custom of poem-trading adds crucible pressure, revealing her values with visible emotional cost in the final laugh.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and deepenings, with orientation anchored by the first sentence in the greenhouse at dusk. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing in the final image of Elara's name in seedlings and her laugh, reweighting grief as self-carving with undeniable conceptual cost. One meaningful deepening suffices, via the ribbon's spiral mapping sorrow's shape.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse at dusk is vividly anchored with sensory details like wet moss, rust, and rattling panes, selectively filtered through Elara's meditative bias. Setting constrains choices, as roots and glass supply resources for ribbon-dyeing and carving, charging the final image of seedlings breaking tiles. Micro-details like the avocado tree evolve causally, mirroring internal grief without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of tracing collective grief tightens accumulatively through ghost-guided deepenings, narrowing options via reversed footsteps surfacing sorrows. One meaningful cadence shift at the ribbon-tying forecloses forgetting, with felt cost in Elara's laugh amid her sprouting name. Agency via renunciation charges the poise, though coincidence in butterfly clustering complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of grief as a widening gyre emerges organically from images like the spiral ribbon and migrating butterflies, inviting reflection on communal loss without tidy morals. Subtext in scents and poems elicits emotional aftereffect, with the final image offering a resonant, non-literal repricing of forgetting as blooming. Purposeful ambiguity lingers in the wing-beat silence, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with Elara's perceptual signature in poetic, meditative noticing, like frost-spelled summons. Voice texture is distinct in rhythmic syntax and purposeful compression, teaching patterns early for legibility at closure. Ghost's dialogue carries subtext and advances mentorship, with indirection in whispers and scents.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in sentences like "glass panes rattling like loosened teeth in the jaw of time," advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, heightening pressure in peak beats like the chisel tap releasing sap. High information density integrates action and image, with final line recharging motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spectral mentorship with butterfly migration and ribbon-mapping transforms grief tropes through specific, grounded choices like dye-tasting feet. Bold risk in accumulative structure heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in thundering calm avoids generics, committing to the premise's implications.</comment>
