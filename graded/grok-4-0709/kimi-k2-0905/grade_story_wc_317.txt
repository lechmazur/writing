<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to safeguard innovation is clear and intensifies compellingly, driving her choices from planting the seed to guiding the growth, with embodied emotions like her pulse matching the storm showing internal conflict. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, as seen in her realization of the cycle proving endurance with felt cost. The single-POV focus excels in revealing flaws through actions, though secondary characters like guests apply minimal pressure, fitting the scope without harm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and cadence shifts, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the envelope's true purpose reweights the premise with conceptual cost, evident in the final realization. Orientation anchors who (Mira), where (mill by brook), and when (stormy night) by the first paragraph, waiving any penalty. The mosaic shards transition legibly via her movements, holding the lens to closure without causality breaks, though some elisions feel slightly ornamental.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven beside the quiet brook is vividly specific, with sensory details like the brook's reversed flow constraining choices and charging the final image of it as an ally. Atmosphere builds tension through storm-born silence, mirrored in the building's breathing walls, evolving causally to support the theme. A recurring object like the seed integrates with the environment to shape the closure, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of safeguarding innovation tightens through the seed's growth and reconfiguration, with a meaningful deepening as vines become clues, narrowing options with visible cost in the labyrinth's mutation. Agency shines in Mira's decisions to plant and redirect growth, driving escalation via protagonist choices, though coincidence in the note's origin slightly complicates without resolving. The cost is unmistakable in her acceptance of eternal cycling, but lacks a second intensification for higher bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of innovation's refuge emerges organically from images like the reversing brook and blooming flower, offering a resonant, non-literal answer in the final reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in gestures and implications, such as the guests as pollinators, invites reflection on cycles with purposeful ambiguity. The core concept integrates tightly, eliciting emotional aftereffect through Mira's expanding possibility, meeting the 9+ test via reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with distinct perceptual signature in Mira's biased noticing of orthogonal angles and vegetal pulses, modulating rhythm under pressure without head-hopping. Prose texture is purposeful, with patterned diction like "storm-born silence" taught early and paid off at closure. Limited dialogue, like the guests' "Midnight," feels natural and advances the plot via subtext, supporting the 9+ test through rhythmic control and elision payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally—short sentences accelerate action like sprinting to the control room, while longer ones build atmosphere—advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, like "damp wool" and "anxious teeth," enhancing propulsion in peak beats without muddle. Zero artifacts touch closure, meeting the 9+ test with clear, multi-job sentences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The premise transforms escape room tropes through surreal vegetal growth and temporal fugue, synthesizing fresh angles like the backward brook and self-writing riddles that feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in nonlinear, accumulative structure heightens stakes organically without gimmickry, adding +0.3 within band. Emotional specificity in Mira's covenant avoids generics, committing fully to implications.</comment>
