<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to foster rebellion through chess and unspoken words is clear and intensifies via her dream-rehearsed actions, culminating in the sapling planting that forecloses fixed games with a felt conceptual cost. Interiority is concrete and embodied in her hearing pieces' whispers, revealing contradictory impulses like coaching loss as growth. Secondary characters like Ellis apply pressure but remain somewhat archetypal, with relationships shifting subtly in the group confession scene. The final renunciation of traditional chess earns stasis through prior symbolic causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Structure accumulates textural density through poetic shards, with legible transitions from library to town displays and back, holding under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors who (Mara), where (cobalt library in mist), and when (evening to amplified quiet) by ~120 words. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing in the dawn locking-up, reweighting games with undeniable conceptual cost via growing questions. One meaningful deepening suffices, with the grotto's integration charging the final image without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt library in mist vividly anchors atmosphere, with sensory details like quivering iron trees and dripping roots filtered through Mara's perceptual bias, constraining choices like cradling the grotto. Micro-setting of the magnetic grotto under starlight charges the closure by entwining real and false roots, reweighting rebellion. Tone tensions hush with amplified quiet, supporting thematic prophecy. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from shelves to town windows to reading circle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of humble rebellion signals early via chess coaching and intensifies through one meaningful deepening in the group confessions, reweighting loss as growth under Accumulative/Textural lens. Pressure coheres via pattern of unspoken gambits, forcing stance crystallization in sapling planting with visible conceptual cost. Agency via Mara's organizing forecloses fixed paths, though coincidence in arrivals complicates without resolving. Moral calculus sharpens in confessing undared moves, but escalation remains subtle without sharper trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of rebellion through second thoughts emerges organically from particulars like backward pawns and entwined roots, inviting reflection on rules without tidy morals. Subtext in gestures like cradling the sapling elicits emotional aftereffect of quiet amplification. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer to losing as learning, reweighting premise via CR without statement. Complexity embraces ambiguity in pieces moving of their own accord, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
