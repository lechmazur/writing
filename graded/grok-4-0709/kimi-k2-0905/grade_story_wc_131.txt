<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's kindly methodical nature drives consistent, pressure-tested choices like caching and uncovering fragments, with embodied emotions in sense memories and a meaningful endurance that forecloses isolation at a felt relational cost. The girl's secondary presence applies relevant pressure through her reactions, revealing Elias's values in micro-choices. Interior contradiction shines in his hidden life versus emerging visibility, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, fragments build density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final palm-press and whisper, with conceptual cost of Elias's isolation ending legibly felt in the charged poise. Orientation anchors who (Elias), where (library crawl space), and when (dawn post-outage) by ~50 words. Single continuous scene fits scope, with one meaningful deepening via the girl's interaction paying off early setups without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The shadowed library at dawn constrains Elias's movements and enables fragment uncovering, with sensory details like pulsing sapphire hush and flickering lights mirroring his emerging visibility and charging the final image of the girl's hand on the boards. Micro-setting of pipe chases and floorboards guides choices tactilely. Atmosphere evolves causally with the outage, supporting tone without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><grade>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, dominant stake of preserving/sharing voices tightens through fragment accumulation, with one meaningful deepening when the girl follows and hears Lorca, forcing Elias's stance crystallization at visible cost to his solitude. Agency in uncovering forecloses hidden paths with felt relational price in the ending. Coherent pressure builds without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of preserved voices illuminating darkness emerges organically from fragments and Elias's actions, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via his own tape's "stories are lanterns" line reweighting isolation. Subtext in silences and implications, like the girl's wordless tracing, invites reflection on visibility without tidy morals. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars like weeping over Lorca.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV on Elias remains stable with controlled distance, perceptual signature in methodical tracing and sense memories biasing notice. Prose texture distinct in rhythmic, image-rich syntax that modulates with pressure, like faster uncovering beats. Sparse dialogue (girl's whisper, tape voices) carries subtext and advances plot naturally; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with sentences advancing atmosphere and character via vivid images like "oxide surface flaking like dried blood," varying rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the final uncovering. No artifacts obscure closure; propulsion strong through selective detail.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crawl space dwelling with audio fragments as ghosts transforms isolation trope through specific sense memories and outage context, heightening stakes organically. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in inevitable visibility without gimmickry. Avoids stock echoes, committing to premise's implications.</comment>
