<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's kindly methodical nature drives consistent, pressure-tested choices like caching and uncovering fragments, with embodied sense memory revealing internal contradictions in his isolation versus visibility. The final renunciation of solitude carries visible emotional cost as the girl presses her palm above his heart, earning the stasis. The girl's secondary presence applies relevant pressure without overwhelming the single-POV focus. Minor slip in her stereotypical wonder, but it doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern of fragment accumulation building to a resonant reconfiguration in the final image, where voices form a constellation and Elias becomes visible with felt cost of ended isolation. Orientation anchors early in the shadowed library at dawn post-outage. One meaningful deepening via the girl's interaction tightens the drive without needing causal turns. Closure lands as Charged Poise, reweighting his existence through shared presence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The shadowed library at dawn constrains Elias's crawling and uncovering, with pipe chases and floorboard gaps charging choices and the final image of the girl's hand on the boards. Sensory details like sapphire hush and flickering lights mirror internal stirring, filtered through his POV bias. Micro-setting of fragments and conduits evolves causally, heightening atmosphere without excess. Recurring tape fragments as objects constrain and charge the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving and sharing voices to become visible tightens accumulatively through fragment uncovering, forcing stance crystallization as the girl responds with tears and recognition. One deepening via Lorca's reel narrows options, with felt cost in Elias's weeping and emerging visibility. Pressure coheres under textural lens without coincidence resolving. Agency in methodical pushing of fragments drives escalation to charged poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of cached stories as lanterns in darkness emerges organically from fragments' voices and Elias's motivation, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer as the girl joins the chorus, reweighting isolation with connection. Subtext in silences and implications, like her whispered "I see you," invites ambiguity without confusion. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars like flaking oxide and Lorca's cracking voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV on Elias remains stable with character-specific perceptual signature in sense memories and methodical tracing, modulating rhythm under pressure like faster uncovering. Prose texture distinct in poetic syntax, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. Dialogue minimal but natural, with subtext in whispers advancing the connection. No head-hopping or elision obscuring the lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose propels with high density and varied rhythm, weaving sensory images like moth wings and sapphire hush without loops or scaffold. Figurative language coherent and purposeful, accelerating in peak beats like uncovering without muddle. Minor synonym churn in "cached" repetitions, but pattern-taught and pays off at closure. Clarity strong, with sentences advancing atmosphere and character seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crawl space dwelling with audio fragments transforms isolation trope through specific sense memories and library outage, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise's implications. Emotional specificity in voices like Lorca's duende avoids generics. Close to famous ghost stories but personalized via methodical kindness.</comment>
