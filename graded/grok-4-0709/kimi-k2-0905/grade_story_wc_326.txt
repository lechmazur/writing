<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to reclaim life and fetch wisdom from failure is clear and intensifies through embodied choices, like drawing the ink ring, revealing internal contradictions between digital existence and fleshly return. Interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions embodied in ticks and fogged breath, avoiding stock phrasing. The final renunciation of ghostly limbo forecloses digital immortality with a felt cost of vulnerability, earned by prior causality. Voice distinction shines in the rough, unspooled dialogue with the clerk, heightening status dynamics under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images like ink fractals and heartbeats, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where failure becomes a corridor, with undeniable conceptual cost in reweighted life fragility. Orientation anchors who (digital ghost survivor), where (opal observatory), and when (post-error night) by ~50 words, serving closure without disorientation penalty. One meaningful deepening via the ink map tightens the stake of borrowed existence. Closure lands on-page with the protagonist walking horizon-ward, reconfiguring error as miracle border.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The opal observatory under snow constrains choices, with frosted dome and copper roof pressuring the return to flesh via cold air razoring lungs, charging the final image of glinting dome as continued existence certificate. Sensory details are vivid and POV-biased, like snow tapping Morse and ink holding galaxies, integrated into action without stalling. Micro-setting of the porcelain shard and inkwell evolves causally, mirroring internal defragmentation. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from dome to stairs to annex, with weather affecting descent and breath.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of living with error-hinged life signals early and deepens via ink map revelation, forcing stance crystallization on failure as corridor under Accumulative lens, with felt cost in relinquishing ghostly safety. One meaningful cadence shift at reassembly narrows options, driven by agency in slicing digital film. Moral calculus sharpens at sharing wisdom with the clerk, trading solace for human vulnerability. Coincidence of the error complicates but doesn't resolve; protagonist's refusal earns the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of failure as life's corridor emerges organically from ink patterns and heartbeat counts, resisting tidy morals through ambiguity in error-miracle border, with plausible counter-readings like systemic fragility. Subtext in gestures like placing the shard as bookmark implies redemption without assertion. Final image of sky as dark page reprices the premise non-literally, eliciting lingering reflection on typo-hinged existence. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality, layering regret and solace through concrete particulars like frozen tears.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in mechanical ticks and Wi-Fi winds, modulating rhythm under pressure like static crackles during reassembly. Prose texture shines in purposeful compression and patterned diction, teaching lyric elision early and paying off at closure without obscurity. Dialogue with clerk is natural, subtext-laden, and advances theme via rough voice pursuing solace exchange. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally from ghostly detachment to embodied gooseflesh.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with sentences advancing atmosphere and character, like ink splays into dendrites revealing regret without redundancy. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in descent and breathing in reflection, free of loops or template cadence. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, with no muddle in peak beats like shard-slicing. Zero artifacts; strong verbs and specific nouns propel momentum, culminating in resonant final line of defragmented steps.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Core premise of digital ghost from clerical error offers fresh synthesis of bureaucracy and existential survival, transformed through specific images like misfiled vital signs and ink map, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to surreal implications like riding Wi-Fi. Avoids tropes via non-obvious moral calculus on failure's wisdom. Emotional specificity in midnight solace avoids generic templates, cohering as singular vision.</comment>
