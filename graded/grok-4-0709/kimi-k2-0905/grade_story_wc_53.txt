<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation as a fragment-collecting scavenger is clear and intensifies through surrenders that compel higher-stakes choices, with interiority concrete and embodied in regrets like the "stab of regret" for surviving incomplete. Internal conflict shows contradictory impulses in bargaining the 2015 frame, revealing a hierarchy of values with visible cost in forgetting the Nikon. The ghost as a secondary character applies immediate pressure, forcing choices that alter their state by the end. Flaws complicate choices without safety-hedging, though emotional progression could layer more contradictory irrationality mid-negotiation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned surrenders of fragments and years, with density increasing via metaphors like the moon-camera, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist becomes translucent with felt cost in regret and weightlessness. Orientation anchors who (scavenger and ghost), where (kinetic lagoon), and when (post-carousel halt at 03:17) early, with deliberate disorientation taught and paying off at closure. One meaningful deepening occurs as frames are released, narrowing options without causality breaks. The blank frame's development into a mirror provides a charged final image with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The surreal setting of the kinetic lagoon with spongy clouds and submerged neon horses is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices like stepping on deflating clouds that exhale fragments. Sensory details are selective, reflecting the protagonist's chronological confusion, with tone tensioning the fractured stillness through humming poles and hiccuping music. A recurring object (moon-camera wheel) charges the final image by being pocketed, meeting the 9+ test. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across clouds and lagoon.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake of negotiating borrowed years tightens through accumulating surrenders, with a meaningful deepening as the ghost grows more solid, narrowing options and forcing the blank frame bargain under the Accumulative lens. Agency manifests in renunciation of frames, foreclosing paths with visible costs like forgetting the Nikon and turning translucent. Pressure coheres until the final reconfiguration, though coincidence in the blank's development slightly complicates without resolving. Moral calculus sharpens the peak choice between potential and proper death.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of eroded ambitions and incomplete survival emerges organically from surrendering fragments and years, with subtext in implications like the ghost's crooked smile mirroring the protagonist's past. The final mirror image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to negotiating one's ghost, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost in swapped solidity. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars like regret as fog, avoiding sentimentality. Purposeful ambiguity lingers in the "oddly" incomplete ending without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in metaphorical noticing, like years as snapshots, and rhythmic control in fractured syntax that heightens pressure without obscurity. Purposeful compression and patterned elision (e.g., moon-wheel clicks) are taught early and paid off at closure. Dialogue is minimal but natural, with the ghost's filmstrip voice carrying subtext and advancing the negotiation. No head-hopping or register mismatches; prose reflects the focalizer's confused mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, every sentence advancing atmosphere or character through vivid images like "spongy vapor compress" and varying rhythms that breathe with the lagoon's stir. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle; metaphors cohere logically, like dandelion seed sighs, propelling momentum. Opening anchors voice in the halting carousel; final line resolves with resonant "oddly," recharging motifs. Zero artifacts in peak beats meet the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of negotiating with one's ghost via a moon-camera wheel offers a fresh synthesis of time, regret, and identity, feeling inevitable through accumulating surrenders. Risk-taking in surreal lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes like ghost encounters via particular fragments. Emotional specificity in eroded ambitions avoids generics, with the mirror twist earned from prior particulars. Bold commitment to the premise coheres as a singular vision.</comment>
