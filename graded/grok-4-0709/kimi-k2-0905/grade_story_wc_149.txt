<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ghost bride's motivation is clear and rooted in her lovingly venomous trait, intensifying through resonant memories to compel her saving the boy, with internal conflict shown in her grief over repeating mercy-killing. The boy's characterization is thinner, with micro-choices like pocketing the bead revealing curiosity under pressure, but his emotions feel less embodied and contradictory. Strengths shine in the climax where understanding flares, earning the endurance of drowning with visible cost. Overall, flaws like the boy's stock thinness limit depth but don't undermine closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned shards of appearances and memories, with legible transitions via recurring images like the bead and winter fields, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the boy rebirths and the ghost dissolves with felt cost. Orientation anchors early in the greenhouse, and one meaningful deepening occurs at the grafting altar, narrowing options. The ending reweights the debt premise without contradiction, though some ellipsis feels slightly unmotivated. Closure lands cleanly on-page with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night is vividly specific, with sensory details like rusted petals and mercury rain filtered through the ghost's bias, constraining choices like ghosting through walls. Micro-setting elements like the bead and frozen river charge the final image, evolving causally to break the endless night at dawn. Tone tensions the mournful elation purposefully, and spatial choreography tracks cleanly across moves. The environment shapes the climax by enabling the drowning mercy, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of repaying the debt signals early, tightening once at the altar confrontation where pressure forces the ghost's intervention, narrowing options under the Accumulative lens with a deepening pattern break in her full appearance. Agency via the ghost's decision to teach dying forecloses paths with visible cost in her dissolution. Coincidence complicates but doesn't resolve, and the boy's hesitation adds moral calculus. Entering 8.5+ as agency drives deepening with unmistakable on-page cost at the river.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of merciful venom across lifetimes emerges organically from images like the bead's pulses and the drowning seed, inviting reflection on forgiveness without tidy morals. Subtext in silences and implications, like the husband's whispered forgiveness, elicits emotional aftereffect through complexity. The final image of the boy walking back reweights the premise non-literally, meeting the 9+ test but capped slightly for oblique counter-readings. No explicit statements mar resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient POV is stable, with clean focalization shifting at section-like breaks between ghost and boy, holding a coherent Accumulative lens at closure without head-hopping. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax like "hush of winter-cracked fields," with perceptual signature biased toward ethereal grief. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; patterned elision in ephemeral cameos is taught early and pays off. Meets 9+ with rhythmic control under pressure and taught patterns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the opening drift and closure hush, advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "veil trailing moon-dust" is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats at the river. No artifacts obscure closure, with strong verbs and specific nouns propelling momentum. Minor synonym churn in repetitions like "ephemeral cameo" is pattern-taught, not penalizing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes ghost bride trope with alchemical mercy-killing in a fresh, non-obvious way, feeling inevitable through recurring bead and debt motifs that heighten stakes. Risk in mosaic shards and mournful elation tone coheres without gimmickry, transforming familiar elements via specific details like the tumor as living pearl. No close echoes of famous scenes, and authenticity shines in the singular vision. Meets 9+ test but adjusted for subtle genre conventions.</comment>
