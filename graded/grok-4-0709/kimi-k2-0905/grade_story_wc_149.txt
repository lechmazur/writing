<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ghost bride's motivation is deeply rooted in ancestral debt, intensifying through visitations that compel her ethereal actions, with embodied contradictions like lovingly venomous whispers revealing internal conflict. The boy's arc from fear to mournful elation shows credible endurance, foreclosing innocence with felt cost in his black-eyed guilt. Relationships under pressure force the boy's stance crystallization, altering their spectral bond by closure. Flaws like the ghost's persistent vengeance complicate choices without hedging, earning the final forgiveness through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned visitations over seven nights, with each shard deepening the bead's pulse and leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the debt is repaid with visible cost in the withering orchard. Orientation anchors who (ghost bride), where (greenhouse), and when (endless night) early, with deliberate mosaic shards taught by 25% and legible transitions via the bead's thrum. Closure lands on-page with the ghost's scattering and the boy's seed-planting, reweighting options with conceptual cost. One meaningful deepening suffices, with persistent bead constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly anchored with sensory details like frost-rimmed soil and steam-exhaling pipes, selectively filtered through the ghost's spectral perception to mirror her hollow state. Setting constrains choices, as the boy's aluminum coat hurts her approach and the dome's crack lets in starlight that slices her veil. Environment charges the final image, with dissolving glass and withering trees embodying the debt's resolution. Tone tensions the mournful elation through iron air and pulsing runes, evolving causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of repaying ancestral debt signals early, tightening through visitations that narrow options, culminating in the boy's fruit-plucking that forces trade-off of his innocence. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern break in the seventh night deepens pressure, reweighting stakes with felt cost in the yanked guilt and withered trees. Agency via the ghost's guidance and boy's understanding crystallizes stance without coincidence resolving. Moral calculus sharpens the climax between blood offering and orchard's purpose, with one visible price altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of debts becoming gifts emerges organically from images like the bead's transformation and fruit's ripening, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the ghost's sadness tasting of spring. Subtext in silence and gestures, such as the veil parting to show hollow face, invites reflection on inherited guilt without confusion. Final image of moths scattering and seed planting offers resonant, non-literal repricing of resonant awakenings beyond the grave. Emotional aftereffect lingers through particulars, avoiding sentimentality with mournful elation's complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with perceptual signature in spectral noticing, like veil trailing as smoke, maintains distance without head-hopping; patterned elision in visitations is taught early and pays off at closure. Voice texture distinct in broken-bell speech and rhythmic prose modulating with intensity, such as accelerating bead pulse. Dialogue natural and subtextual, advancing plot via boy's "I didn’t do it" evading guilt, distinguished by age-appropriate shake. Non-standard punctuation and syntax voice-motivated, legible under pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose dense with multi-job sentences, like "veil trailing like smoke through the alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night," advancing atmosphere and momentum without loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in light-pouring climax; figurative language coherent, as in debt as vine finding sun, without muddle or register drift. Clarity high, with strong verbs and specific nouns propelling to final image recharging motifs. Zero artifacts in peak beats, high propulsion integrating details purposefully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost bride trope through alchemical orchard and debt-as-vine premise, transforming familiar supernatural redemption with specific details like molten silver pomegranates and bead's heartbeat. Risk-taking in mosaic structure heightens stakes via accumulating visitations, feeling inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry. Emotional complexity in lovingly venomous tone avoids generic templates, committing to premise's implications. Non-obvious angle on inheritance reweights material boldly, cohering as singular vision.</comment>
