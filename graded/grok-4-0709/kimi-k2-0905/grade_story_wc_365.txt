<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to map sensory truths is clear and intensifies through embodied emotions, with contradictory impulses shown in her reaching for the younger self versus the shard's redirection, culminating in an earned renunciation that forecloses ignorance with visible grief. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, as in swallowing the data cube to digest encrypted grief. Flaws like unwitting complicity complicate choices without hedging, and the final decision reveals a hierarchy of values with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned shards with legible transitions, teaching the weaving motif early and landing a Conceptual Repricing closure where the truth realization reweights her complicity with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors who (map maker), where (abandoned spaceport), and when (night to dawn) by ~120 words without disorientation debt. One meaningful deepening suffices, as the locker discovery tightens toward revelation, though causality feels more textural than strict linkage in mid-shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is vividly specific with sensory details like rust-tasting dust and bulkheads bending, filtered through POV bias and constraining choices, such as the deck folding to reveal doorways. Atmosphere evolves causally from night murmurs to bruised gold dawn, mirroring internal reconfiguration. A recurring object (green glass shard) charges the final image by going dull after pulsing truths.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of discovering withheld truths escalates through density increase in shard explorations, with one meaningful deepening at the locker forcing stance crystallization on complicity. Agency manifests in endurance and redirection, foreclosing denial with felt grief cost legible in the engines roaring in her skull. Coincidence (shard signals) complicates without resolving, though pressure could narrow options more explicitly at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of weighing buried truths emerges organically from images like the note's mass of carried truths and shard-weaving, inviting reflection on complicity without tidy morals. Subtext in silences and implications, such as the lover's hidden ship, elicits emotional aftereffect through complexity. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by repricing her craft toward revelation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with controlled distance, perceptual signature biased toward sensory mapping (e.g., tasting density, feeling vibrations). Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, lyric syntax that modulates with intensity, teaching patterned elision early and paying off at closure. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; non-standard punctuation serves voice without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel momentum, as in cyclical phrases like "cyclically spontaneous" that accumulate texture without loops. No artifacts obscure closure; metaphors are coherent and purposeful, enhancing propulsion in peak beats like the loom tightening. Information advances atmosphere and character, with strong verbs and specific nouns dominating.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes parallel universes with sensory mapping in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming sci-fi tropes through grounded emotional complexity like digesting grief. Risk-taking in lyric mosaic heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the final reconfiguration. Authenticity coheres as a singular vision of revelation.</comment>
