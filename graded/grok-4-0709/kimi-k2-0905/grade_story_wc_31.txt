<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jin's motivation to discover the color of sound is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in childhood curiosity that drives his dive; interiority is concrete and embodied, with emotions like the "brittle sigh" of the lily revealing contradictory wonder and urgency. The meaningful change in realization feels earned, foreclosing isolation with a felt conceptual cost. Strength lies in micro-choices under pressure, such as cautious breathing in air pockets, showing value hierarchy. No major flaws, but internal conflict could layer more simultaneous impulses for deeper contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern breaks in the dive deepening knowledge; closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing as Jin realizes sound is light, with conceptual cost legible in the reconfiguration of his perception and role. Orientation anchors early in the harbor at night; one meaningful deepening suffices, with the cylinder playback as a cadence shift reweighting stakes. Strength in taught poetic pattern paying off at closure, but causality feels more textural than tightly linked in spots like the woman's sudden appearance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "copper echo onto the water" and bioluminescent plankton mirror internal states and charge the final image of colored pier lights; the sunken library constrains choices, such as navigating air pockets, evolving causally with events. Atmosphere of "meteor hush" supports tone purposefully; micro-setting of the safe and cylinder as tools heightens specificity. Recurring lanterns and reflections charge closure, meeting 9+ test exceptionally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering sound's color signals early and deepens once in the safe, narrowing options with underwater pressures forcing stance crystallization under Textural lens; agency in diving and listening forecloses surface safety with felt cost in the ascent. Escalation via plankton bloom and voices offers meaningful intensification, but conflict remains low-tension exploration without strong internal/external interweave or ethical calculus. Strength in conceptual price at crescendo, but lacks a sharper reversal testing commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of luminous vows as enduring light/sound emerges organically from images like the cylinder's chords igniting colors, offering resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing; subtext in silences and implications, such as the woman's uniform, invites ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect feels honest through particulars; final image recharges motifs subtly. Meets 9+ test with closure repricing human sound as searching light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature in synesthetic noticing, like sounds tasting "green"; prose texture rhythmic and purposeful, modulating with intensity in underwater velvet. Patterned diction and compression taught early, paying off legibly; no head-hopping or elision issues. Meets 9+ test with rhythmic control heightening pressure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in rhythmic sentences like "the sky bloomed with paper lanterns," varying syntax naturally without loops or scaffold; figurative language coherent and voice-motivated, accelerating in peak beats. Clarity strong, with no artifacts dulling closure; information advances atmosphere and character seamlessly. Meets 9+ test with zero redundancies and controlled metaphors charging the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia and submerged vows transforms fantasy tropes through specific details like the phonograph in plankton; risk in poetic structure heightens stakes organically without gimmickry. Core premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with emotional specificity avoiding generics; meets 9+ test subtly via non-obvious reconfiguration.</comment>
