<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The priest's motivation to confront collective doubt through sound layers is clear and intensifies compellingly, with embodied emotions like the iron-tasting swallow revealing internal conflict under pressure. The woman's secondary presence applies relevant pressure, forcing a relational crucible that alters the possession's outcome. However, the congregation feels underdeveloped as a group, slightly diluting individual specificity in status dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds layers causally toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final vacuum and clarity, with the possession passing as a legible before/after cost. Orientation anchors who (priest), where (nave), and when (dusk before possession) by ~50 words, waiving any penalty. Minor redundancy in loop descriptions slightly softens propulsion without breaking causality at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The church nave is vividly specific, with details like the cracked fresco and sinking cross constraining choices and charging the final image of dried paint. Sensory hierarchy reflects the priest's urgency, narrowing to sound and color under pressure. The dimensional anchor as micro-setting evolves causally, mirroring internal unraveling without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of averting possession through plumbing fears tightens once via the infinite reverse loop, reweighting options with the felt cost of blood-tasted doubt under the Accumulative lens. Agency in the priest's overdubs and kneel drives deepening, foreclosing silence's void. Coincidence in the woman's voice complicates but does not resolve, though escalation could narrow options more sharply.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of doubt as a dilutable wall emerges organically from sound layers and blue cross, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the woman's line about agreement not to touch it, reweighting faith's premise without moralizing. Subtext in silence and negative space invites reflection on unspoken fears. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in muffled sounds and colors, modulating rhythm under pressure without head-hopping. Prose texture in elongated syntax reflects the looping mind, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual, advancing the thematic surrender in the half-speed whisper.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with rhythmic variety, like the sagging vowels in playback, advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, such as stillness uncoiling like incense, heightening propulsion in peak beats. No artifacts obscure closure, though one simultaneity in footfalls could tighten slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes loop pedals with exorcism in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming tropes of faith through sound-as-rope ingenuity that feels inevitable. Risk in surreal elements heightens stakes organically without gimmickry. Minor echo of poetic possession motifs slightly tempers full originality.</comment>
