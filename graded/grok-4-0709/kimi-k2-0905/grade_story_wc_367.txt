<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation to shape a new dawn is clear and intensifies through her geas, compelling choices like pressing the wick to the lens that reveal contradictory impulses in her accidental prophecies and shadowed elation. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with emotions shown in cracked laughs and tightened fingers, avoiding stock phrasing. The final renunciation of her herald role into reader feels earned with visible cost, as the wick consumes itself and stars are erased. Strength lies in flaws complicating choices without hedging, though the archetypal herald trait borders on stereotype, slightly limiting individuality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and echoes like laughs multiplying into prophecies, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the lighthouse dissolves into a white canvas with conceptual cost of erased stars birthing sunspots. Orientation anchors early in the emerald lighthouse at moonset, with deliberate surreal disorientation paying off at closure. One continuous scene fits scope, with meaningful deepening in the lens turning of its own accord. Strength in coherent pattern teaching and held lens, with no causality breaks despite elliptical turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse under lying stars is vividly specific, with sensory details like salt air and groaning granite integrated into action, constraining choices as the lens turns and membrane thins. Atmosphere of post-print silence mirrors internal prophecy, charging the final image of dew without ink. Micro-setting of the lantern room as prow evolves causally, affecting navigation. Exceptional in how environment pressures the climax, like the dark sail catching future wind, fulfilling 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of shaping dawn from shadows signals early and tightens through prophetic laughs, with agency in steering via wick sparking that forecloses paths like erasing stars for sunspots, under Accumulative lens via density increase to cadence shift. One meaningful deepening suffices, with visible cost in wick's sacrifice altering tactics. Pressure coheres but coincidence of lens turning independently slightly complicates without fully resolving. Strength in ethical calculus at laughs accepting geas, though stakes feel more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of renewal from print's death emerges organically through images like ink bleeding into sails and light presses, inviting reflection on stories' evolution without tidy morals. Subtext in silences and implications, like shadowed elation, elicits emotional aftereffect of hopeful melancholy. Final image of shadow as first letter offers resonant, non-literal answer reweighting premise. Exceptional integration with core concept, fulfilling 9+ test, though ambiguity lingers purposefully without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-specific, with perceptual signature in poetic noticing like porcelain echoes and silver notes. Voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, image-dense syntax modulating with intensity, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. No head-hopping or dialogue, but prose as character reflects Lirael's prophetic mind. Strength in purposeful compression paying off in final reconfiguration, though some diction borders on elevated register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in sentences like "She laughed, and the sail billowed, towing the lighthouse off its foundation," advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language coheres without muddle, high density in multi-job lines like black flame printing text on eyelids. No artifacts obscure closure, fulfilling 9+ test with clear propulsion. Exceptional craft in idiosyncratic detail, though occasional stacked metaphors in peak beats slightly test density check.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-print apocalypse with prophetic lighthouse navigation feels inevitable, transforming tropes like beacons into sailing structures through specific details like emerald eye and dark sail. Bold risk in surreal premise heightens stakes organically, with fresh inflection in laughs erasing stars. Authenticity coheres as singular vision, not prompt-stitched. Strength in non-obvious angle on media death, fulfilling 9+ test with risk elevating coherence.</comment>
