<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to reforge the sisterly bond is clear and intensifies through embodied contradictions, like fighting her own glow while pursuing the ritual; interiority shines in specific sensory memories, such as tasting her sister's first kiss during inhalation. The final merger earns its endurance by prior causality, with visible cost in lost individuality. Relationships act as crucible, forcing the transformative choice under phoenix pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered sensory and memorial shards to a resonant reconfiguration in the merger, with felt cost in the inhalation that hollows bones yet steadies the heartbeat. Orientation anchors early in the moonlit orchard arrival. One meaningful deepening suffices, as spice conjuration patterns tighten toward closure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The fairy-tale orchard under permanent moonlight is vividly specific, with sensory details like bruised soles on starfruit and backward-opening blossoms constraining choices and charging the final image of burning-yet-unconsumed blooms. Atmosphere mirrors internal grief through tactile navigation, evolving causally as the ritual unfolds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reforging the bond signals early and deepens via the ritual's tightening pressure, culminating in agency-driven merger with unmistakable cost in mutual inhalation. Under the textural lens, pattern breaks like the phoenix's scream force stance crystallization without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of love as furnace and forge emerges organically from spice-infused memories and metamorphosis, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final merged guardian image that reweights the premise without moralizing.
