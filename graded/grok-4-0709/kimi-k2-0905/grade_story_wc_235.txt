<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied contradictions, like jealousy of past selves and the corpse, driving micro-choices under pressure; the final renunciation of linear time feels earned through prior reflections, foreclosing escapism with felt emotional cost in the scroll's erasure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images and deepenings to a Conceptual Repricing closure where erasure continues the narrative, with conceptual cost legible in the final snow scene; orientation anchors early in the cabin awakening, though minor elisions slightly soften causality without breaking the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory details like moonlight slicing snow into blue glass constrain choices and charge the final image of the vanishing scroll; setting mirrors internal chaos, evolving causally with wind and sparks to heighten atmosphere without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of taming chaos escalates through textural deepenings like the eagle flight and scroll additions, forcing stance crystallization in the snow with felt cost of acceptance; one meaningful tightening suffices, though pressure remains more internal than external.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of feral nostalgia emerges organically from images like the wheel of time and eroding grave, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the vanishing scroll that reweights life's chaos without moralizing; subtext in silences and implications enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature in lyric compression, like sparks as words reduced to ash; rhythmic control heightens pressure, with purposeful elision taught early and paid off in closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in varied syntax, with metaphors like wind as a page turning advancing atmosphere without muddle; zero loops or artifacts, and the final line resolves by recharging motifs like the mountain's exhale.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream chronicling and nonlinear time feels inevitable, with bold lyric risks heightening stakes through images like the spiral scroll; transforms familiar tropes of mortality into specific, memorable ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
