<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Miren's motivation to exhume her sister's memories is clear and intensifies through embodied sensations like the tremor in her hands, revealing contradictory impulses in her whispered deletion date and reaching for firefly-like memories. Interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions embodied in the weight of a hand or smell of wet rope, avoiding stock phrasing. The meaningful endurance earns stasis by accepting the memories as ballast, foreclosing full possession with felt cost in the crumbling flowers. Flaws like persistent grief complicate choices without hedging, shown in her steady flame despite lingering tremors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elisions like gravity pockets and memory minnows, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where deleted memories sink into thin rules, reweighting forgetting with undeniable conceptual cost in the city's lungs inhaling dust. Orientation anchors early with Miren at the dock watching the whale's carcass, and disorientation from fluctuating gravity serves closure by carrying her forward like a secret tide. One meaningful deepening suffices, with the gravity point's collapse as a cadence shift that reconfigures options. Persistent constraint of the whale's shadow shapes tactics, charging the final image of her unbroken shadow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The salt crystal growing chamber anchors vividly with translucent formations bending light into breathing rainbows, constraining choices as gravity pockets pull steps into arcs and enable memory emergence. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like the mist tasting of iron and forgetting, filtered through Miren's urgency. The environment evolves causally, with crystals cracking to release memories, mirroring her internal restoration. A recurring object like the pressed wildflowers charges the final image by crumbling and dispersing as dust, constraining the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of retrieving deleted memories signals early and deepens through one meaningful cadence shift when the gravity point collapses, reweighting the stake under the Accumulative/Textural lens by foreclosing full capture with felt cost in the residue of gleaming silence. Pressure coheres via gravity fluctuations forcing stance crystallization in her whispering and reaching, with agency in renunciation as she releases the dust. Coincidence of the whale's beaching complicates but does not resolve, as her tracking via coffee grounds earns the confrontation. Moral calculus sharpens in accepting partial recovery over total loss, though escalation remains subtle without a sharper trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memories sinking into thin places emerges organically from images like whale bones and orbiting fireflies, resisting tidy morals by embracing ambiguity in drifting memories that some will dream without knowing. Subtext in gestures like laying flowers on the shadow invites reflection on deletion's permanence, with emotional aftereffect in the ballast of laughter. The final image of dust dispersing offers a resonant, non-literal answer to where deleted memories go, reweighting the premise without statement. Complexity avoids false equivalence, committing to the cost of partial reclamation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature in Miren's biased noticing of spirals in coffee grounds and gravity's dance, modulating rhythm under pressure like short, fragmented sentences during memory emergence. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, patterned diction like "gleaming silence," teaching compression early and paying off at closure without elision. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; free indirect style is clean, with psychic distance shifting intentionally in sensations like gulls arguing. Non-standard punctuation in poetic phrasing is consistent and voice-motivated, enhancing legibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with lines like "pockets of gravity fluctuated mysteriously" advancing atmosphere and stakes without scaffold or loops, varying rhythm through purposeful fragments and longer arcs. Clarity and concision propel momentum, with figurative language coherent and payoff-driven, like mist exhaling without muddle in peak beats. No artifacts like synonym churn or template cadence; sentence variety supports emphasis, as in the final image's resonant release. Opening anchors voice in the steaming carcass, and final line recharges motifs with integrated specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Core premise of exhuming memories from a gravity-warping whale synthesizes surreal elements into a fresh angle on loss and deletion, feeling inevitable through grounded choices like tracking via coffee grounds. Tropes of beached whales transform via specific, memorable perspective in salt crystals and memory minnows, with risk-taking in lyric structure heightening stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth in partial recovery avoids generics, committing to implications like the city's unknowing inhalation. One fresh inflection in gravity's gentle distortion reconfigures forgetting organically.</comment>
