<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom disguised as foolishness emerges organically from her actions and the map's dual layers, inviting reflection on adjacent possibilities without tidy morals, as the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by rewriting the night.

Dramatic irony builds from scholars' underestimation, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost in the averted coup.</comment>
