<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to transform her father's violent legacy into peaceful growth is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying through embodied emotions like pressing her ear to the ground to hear roots; interior conflict shows contradictory impulses between inheritance and choice, with the final grafting revealing a hierarchy of values at visible cost. Strengths include concrete interiority avoiding stock phrasing, though secondary characters (parents) apply pressure only through reflection, fitting single-POV defaults. The line "She had inherited her father's senselessly perceptive eyes" exemplifies perceptive traits driving action without label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images of roses and weaving to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the dawn planting, with felt cost of accepting violent threads; orientation anchors early in the desert dome, and one meaningful deepening suffices for length. Closure lands on-page with conceptual repricing of chaos into continuity, charged by the final pulse of roots. Minor slip in reflective density slightly flattens causality mid-story, but pays off at end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glass-domed desert rose farm constrains choices and charges the final image, with cracked dome filtering sunset in amber tones mirroring internal transformation; sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, like thorny bushes and warm sand, evolving causally from tower's fall. Micro-setting of workbench and earth integrates into action, guiding the grafting with tactile specificity. The "tranquil blaze of sunset" line exemplifies purposeful atmosphere enhancing theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><grade>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, dominant stake of weaving continuity escalates through density increase in grafting beats, culminating in stance crystallization with felt cost of loss; one meaningful deepening via singing and weaving narrows options, forcing acceptance of violence. Agency in renunciation of vengeance forecloses paths, though coincidence of tower fall complicates without resolving. The night's work beat shows credible trade-off, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of transforming chaos into harmony emerges organically from grafting images and rose colors shifting to forgiveness, inviting reflection through ambiguity without confusion; final image offers resonant, non-literal answer reweighting violence as growth. Subtext in silence and petals carries emotional honesty, avoiding sentimentality. The "petals carrying the memory of both her parents" line recharges prior motifs with complexity, embracing moral ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with controlled distance, perceptual signature biased toward gentle tending; prose texture in rhythmic, lyric syntax reflects Mira's mind, like slow thoughts in silence. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; purposeful compression in reflections is taught early and pays off at closure. The "engraved quiet" phrase exemplifies distinct voice modulating with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the underwater silence simile advancing atmosphere; minor paraphrase loops in rose descriptions dull momentum slightly, but no artifacts touch closure. Strong verbs and specific nouns propel beats, with final line recharging motifs via image. Overwriting in figurative strings is patterned and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak grafting moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bounty hunter legacy with pacifist horticulture feels inevitable through specific grafting method, transforming tropes of inheritance; risk in lyric, reflective mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in weaving hair and canvas avoids generics, committing to premise. The hybrid rose creation inflects non-obviously, recharging destruction into growth.</comment>
