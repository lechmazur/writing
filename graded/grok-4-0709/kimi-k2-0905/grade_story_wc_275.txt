<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonist Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her pacifist inheritance, intensifying through her grafting actions that reveal internal contradictions between her parents' legacies; emotions are embodied in her tactile interactions with the sandbag and roses, showing credible endurance with felt cost in the final planting. Secondary characters (parents) apply pressure via memory without on-page presence, fitting single-POV defaults. Interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing, though some reflections border on over-articulated insights.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through reflective shards in one continuous greenhouse scene, with orientation anchored early in the desert dome post-tower fall; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration via the final planting and pulse-hearing, reweighting loss into continuity with conceptual cost of accepting violence's threads. No causality breaks, as pattern of grafting and singing accumulates toward Charged Poise. One meaningful deepening suffices for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glass-domed desert rose farm anchors setting vividly with sensory details like wind-scent and sunset blaze, filtered through Mira's perceptive bias; environment constrains and charges choices, as the cracked dome and blood-soaked earth mirror internal transformation, evolving causally to the final planting spot. Micro-setting of workbench and thorns integrates into action, charging the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of weaving continuity through chaos signals early and tightens once via the night's grafting, deepening to foreclose pure pacifism with the cost of integrating violence; under Textural lens, cadence shift at dawn reweights remembrance with felt emotional price. Agency in renunciation of vengeance is earned, though pressure remains internal without external antagonism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of transforming destruction into growth emerges organically from grafting and blooming imagery, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in uniting hunter and pacifist legacies; final image offers resonant, non-literal repricing of continuity without stated moral. Subtext in rose colors and whispers invites reflection on harmony amid chaos.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV maintains controlled distance, with perceptual signature in Mira's senselessly perceptive noticing of blooms and weaves; prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, lyric syntax that modulates with emotional intensity, teaching patterned elision early. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; elision of time through night pays off at dawn without confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the silence-as-pressure description; no significant loops or artifacts, though some figurative stacking in sunset and blaze moments borders on dense without muddle. Information advances atmosphere and character; final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bounty hunting and pacifist horticulture through grafting violence into peace feels organic and inevitable, transforming tropes with specific details like canvas-weave petals; risk in lyric, reflective mode heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
