<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prophet's motivation to convert obstacles into instruments is clear and intensifies through resonant actions, with embodied choices like striking absence revealing a hierarchy of values; interiority is concrete via perceptual details like cloud-reading, though secondary characters like children remain peripheral without applying pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered sounds and echoes to a Resonant Reconfiguration at the end, with the raft's movement as a charged poise reweighting the calm; orientation anchors early in the floating orchard, and one meaningful deepening suffices, though causality feels more poetic than strict linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating orchard setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like swaying trees and salt-curled parchment constraining choices; the environment charges the final image of the spiral sky and moving raft, evolving causally from calm to breeze without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of navigating the Doldrum Wall via resonance escalates through accumulative pressure, with a meaningful deepening when the prophet strikes absence and rigs tubes, forcing stance crystallization; cost is felt in the conceptual repricing of silence as groove, though agency leans more toward endurance than decisive change.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of transforming obstacles into instruments emerges organically from images like the cloud lyre and fractal echoes, inviting reflection on resonance without tidy morals; the final image of the orchard as orchestra offers a resonant, non-literal answer reweighting the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic noticing of sounds and clouds; prose texture features rhythmic, purposeful syntax like "fractal generating" that modulates with intensity, teaching its pattern early and paying off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm through arpeggios and echoes without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "clouds moved in slow arpeggios" accelerates momentum in peak beats, with zero artifacts dulling the closure image of the orchard becoming orchestra.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of a sonic prophet navigating a floating orchard via resonance offers fresh synthesis of surreal elements, transforming tropes like sea calm through specific ingenuity like striking absence; risk-taking in poetic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
