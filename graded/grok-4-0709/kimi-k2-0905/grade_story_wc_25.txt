<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as a seasoned worker is clear and intensifies through her maps and acoustic expertise, compelling her to guide the stranger with embodied curiosity; the woman's inheritance adds relational pressure that forces a shared revelation. Internal conflict shows in Mira's hesitation and realization of incomplete knowledge, with emotions embodied in her palm against metal and coin handling. Flaws like over-reliance on professional competence without deeper contradiction limit nuance, but the final endurance reconfigures her worldview with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered whispers and revelations in one continuous scene, with orientation anchored by the storm and containers within the first sentence. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing when Mira realizes the labyrinth's acoustic purpose, reweighting her maps with undeniable conceptual cost in the chamber's pulse. Causality holds via motivated details like the key and coin, though minor ellipsis in navigation slightly softens linkage without harming the resonant ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The port city's towering containers create a vivid, tactile labyrinth that constrains navigation and amplifies whispers, charging the final chamber image with harmonic resonance. Sensory details like metallic echoes and aurora light are selective and POV-filtered through Mira's expertise, evolving causally with the storm's surge. The micro-setting of the panel and coins directly shapes the closure, mirroring internal discovery without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving the whisper network signals early via the woman's explanation, tightening through the three-whisper challenge that deepens knowledge and narrows options under the storm's pressure. Protagonist agency in leading and palm placement drives a meaningful deepening, with felt cost in Mira's incomplete maps reweighted at closure. Coincidence of the storm complicates but does not resolve, though stakes remain more conceptual than visceral, limiting peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of whispers traveling farther than shouts emerges organically from acoustic mechanics and war-time secrets, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like coin placement and echoing emotions invites reflection on quiet power amid noise. Emotional aftereffect arises from Mira's realization, embracing complexity without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV on Mira maintains controlled distance, with perceptual signature in her ear for walks and vibrations biasing sensory details. Dialogue is natural, subtext-laden, and goal-driven, distinguishing characters through educated gait versus worker expertise, advancing plot via whispers. Prose texture in rhythmic syntax heightens storm intensity without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, multi-job sentences like the aurora-reflecting coin, varying rhythm to match storm surges without loops or artifacts. Clarity and propulsion shine in integrated action-description, such as unfolding maps amid echoes, with strong verbs and specific nouns propelling momentum. No overwriting or muddle in peak beats, and the final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of geomagnetic storm, acoustic labyrinth, and whisper codes transforms familiar mystery tropes into a fresh angle on hidden networks, feeling inevitable through Mira's maps. Risk in calculated spontaneity heightens stakes via sound-based navigation, cohering as a singular vision without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in the chamber's pulse avoids generics, though proximity to war-time secret motifs slightly tempers novelty.</comment>
