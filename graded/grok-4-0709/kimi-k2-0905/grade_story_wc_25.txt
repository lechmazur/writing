<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as a seasoned worker is clear and intensifies through curiosity, leading to an earned realization about her maps' incompleteness with conceptual cost. Interiority is concrete, embodied in her sensory perceptions like identifying walks and vibrations, revealing contradictory impulses in her calculated caution versus spontaneous guidance. The relationship with the stranger acts as a crucible, forcing choices that alter understanding, though the woman's traits feel slightly stock without deeper contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered revelations and atmospheric density, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the labyrinth's acoustic purpose reweights Mira's knowledge with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors early in the port labyrinth during the storm, with one continuous scene fitting defaults. Closure lands on-page via the pulsing chamber and coin placement, though causality feels more textural than strictly motivated in the final surge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The port city labyrinth during a geomagnetic storm is vividly specific, with sensory details like metallic whispers and aurora reflections filtered through Mira's professional bias, constraining choices in navigation. The environment charges the final image, as containers resonate harmonically, mirroring internal realization. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, evolving causally with the storm's intensification.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering the labyrinth's secret tightens through the whisper challenge and panel opening, deepening knowledge under textural pressure with a felt conceptual cost in Mira's map reevaluation. Agency via Mira's micro-choices, like leading the way, drives escalation without coincidence resolving it. One meaningful deepening suffices, though stakes remain more atmospheric than viscerally narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of whispers traveling farther than shouts emerges organically from events, images like the zodiac coin, and the acoustic chamber, offering a resonant non-literal answer that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in gestures and silences, like the woman's educated gait, invites reflection on quiet voices amid noise. Emotional aftereffect is concrete, avoiding sentimentality through Mira's flawed, incomplete maps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV stays stable and character-bound, with perceptual signature in Mira's auditory focus and map reliance, modulating distance intentionally under storm pressure. Dialogue is natural, subtext-laden, and advances plot, distinguishing characters through whispers and maritime code. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic syntax, though some elevated diction slightly drifts from Mira's worker voice in peak moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel momentum, as in the harmonic resonance description that advances atmosphere without loops. No significant artifacts; metaphors like "violet ribbons" are coherent and purposeful, integrated into action. Final line recharges motifs effectively, with strong verbs and specific details enhancing clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of geomagnetic storm, acoustic labyrinth, and whisper network transforms familiar mystery tropes through specific auditory details and thematic depth, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk in textural structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though premise echoes adventure tales without fully bold subversion.</comment>
