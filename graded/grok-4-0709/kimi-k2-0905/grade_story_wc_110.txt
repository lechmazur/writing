<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to thaw mistrust drives consistent, high-stakes choices, with embodied emotions like her pulse stumbling during eavesdropping revealing internal conflict; secondary characters Rico and Jun apply immediate pressure through their staged absolution, forcing her renunciation of resentment with visible relational cost at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages from finding the ticket to projecting the film, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where trust is restored with felt cost of past silence; orientation anchors early in the forecourt, and single continuous scene fits scope without disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The crystal whispering forecourt after rain constrains choices, with wet stone and pillars mirroring emotional thawing, charging the final image of sweeping together; sensory details like dust floating like plankton and resonant hush are selective, POV-filtered, and evolve causally to support closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resolving mistrust tightens through eavesdropping reversal, narrowing options and forcing stance crystallization with relational cost at the projector moment; under causal lens, one meaningful deepening suffices, though coincidence of voices complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of honesty freeing frozen relationships emerges organically from particulars like the cryptic ticket and projected memories, offering resonant ambiguity in the open lock doodle without moralizing; final image reweights mistrust's cost non-literally, inviting reflection on trust's weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with distinct perceptual signature in Mira's biased noticing of doodles and hush; prose texture in rhythmic, voice-motivated syntax heightens pressure, like "heart drumming a funeral march," with dialogue natural, subtextual, and advancing reconciliation at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in vivid sentences like "dust floated like plankton," with varied rhythm and no major loops, though occasional dense metaphors in peak beats slightly muddle without obscuring closure; clarity strong, advancing atmosphere through concise, multi-job lines.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scavenger hunt and silent film as absolution transforms workplace mistrust trope through specific doodles and projector lens, heightening stakes organically; risk in ambiguous riddle feels inevitable, charging closure without gimmickry.</comment>
