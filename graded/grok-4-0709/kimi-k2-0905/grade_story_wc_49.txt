<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies through her daughter's illness, driving high-stakes choices like precise timing in song and harvest; interiority is concrete with embodied grief in the "weight of centuries pressing against her chest." Strengths include contradictory impulses in her cracking voice evolving to strength, revealing values with felt cost. Minor weakness in slightly stock traits like "weathered fingers," but they align with pressure without harming closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through rhythmic song and transformation with coherent density increase to closure; Resonant Reconfiguration lands via pollen release and valley's remembering, with conceptual cost of cultural grief legible in the final image. Orientation anchors early with Elara on the branch at dawn. Strength in one meaningful deepening as moon sets, shaping tactics without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like "gathering hush pressed against her skin like silk" and bioluminescent runes create purposeful atmosphere; the arbor constrains choices by amplifying song and providing tendrils, charging the final image of new spirals. Micro-setting of vine and feather integrates into action, reflecting POV bias. No major flaws, with tone tensioning theme effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring ancestral knowledge tightens via moon's descent, forcing timed agency in harvest and release; one meaningful deepening narrows options with withering tendril, driving protagonist's stance crystallization under Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in grief and cultural weight, though slightly oblique. Strength in ethical calculus between ambition and order, but minor abstraction in stakes at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of sacred practices as sophisticated balance emerges organically from pollen's mnemonic remedy and song's revelations, with resonant final image repricing progress's cost without moralizing. Subtext in shimmering runes and spores implies lost harmony. Strength in complexity avoiding binaries, but epiphany borders on assertion in "understanding that sacred practices weren't primitive."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with distinct perceptual signature in Elara's focus on ratios and songs; prose texture rhythmic and purposeful, modulating with intensity like cracking voice to harmony. No head-hopping or elision issues; patterned diction teaches lyric mode early, paying off at closure. Strength in prose as character, reflecting tinkerer's whimsical precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with sentences advancing atmosphere and pressure, like "petals the color of aged parchment unfolded" doing double duty; rhythmic variety in long, flowing syntax breathes with song without loops. Minor scaffold in repeated "golden stories," but purposeful and taught. Strength in clarity and propulsion, zero artifacts dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy and science in mnemonic pollen and lunar agriculture transforms tropes through specific details like phoenix feather; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes organically. Strength in non-obvious angle on cultural forgetting, feeling inevitable at release. Minor echo of mythic harvest rituals, but grounded in character.</comment>
