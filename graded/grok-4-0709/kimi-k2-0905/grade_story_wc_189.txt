<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The chronicler's motivation for reconciliation is rooted in consistent traits like tangential observation, intensifying through embodied emotions and micro-choices, such as offering the jade cicada, which earns the resonant endurance with felt relational cost. Interior conflict shows contradictory impulses in her flight and invitation, with emotions embodied in trembling lantern and salt on lips, avoiding stock phrasing. The relationship with the daughter acts as a crucible, forcing choices that alter their state by the end, highlighted in the shadow-merging moment on the grotto wall.</comment>

Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, evolving causally with the tide's turn.</comment>

Coincidence of the daughter's tide-drawn arrival complicates without resolving, aligning with the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of transition periods as patient, tactile pauses emerges organically from images like the cicada's seventeen-year sleep and the pool holding the ocean, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final charged poise without moralizing.
