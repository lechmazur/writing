<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to reconcile her mistake intensifies compellingly, with embodied emotions like the "cleft in certainty" widening into a door, showing contradictory impulses in her kneeling and tearful acceptance; the changeling's interaction applies crucible pressure, earning the final renunciation with visible cost in her radiant cracks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through reflective shards with one meaningful deepening at the sundial encounter, landing a Resonant Reconfiguration via the tooth placement and garden shiver; orientation anchors early in the garden, but minor ellipsis in the path reveal slightly softens causality without harming closure cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The secret garden's vivid, purposeful details—like humming hedges and vertebra sundial—constrain Elara's choices and charge the final image of rewoven labyrinths, with sensory hierarchy reflecting her urgency and mirroring internal fractures through bruised mint and iron scents.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reframing mistakes tightens once through the changeling's map, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in tears salting ink; agency via placing the tooth forecloses denial, though coincidence in the briar path slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of mistakes as strengthening constellations emerges organically from particulars like the yew log fertilizing pears, culminating in a resonant, non-literal final image of Elara's heart as a map of bright fractures without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in Elara's biased noticing of bone pavers; rhythmic prose modulates with pressure, like "tasting chalk and thunder," and dialogue carries subtext in the changeling's flute-like voice pursuing invitation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion shine in lines like "palms itching with the memory of splints," with varied syntax, no loops or artifacts, and figurative language cohering without muddle, accelerating to the shivering garden closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of changeling lore with bone-setting metaphor transforms tropes through Elara's specific worldview, heightening stakes in the map of missteps; risk in poetic compression feels inevitable, as in the tooth as "ransom" and "invitation."</comment>
