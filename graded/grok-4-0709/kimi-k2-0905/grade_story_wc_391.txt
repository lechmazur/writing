<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to sculpt patience from impatience is clear and intensifies through concrete micro-choices, like mapping moon paths despite his rattling second heart, revealing embodied contradictory impulses. Internal conflict shows simultaneously in his impatience cooling into a carryable stone at closure, with felt cost in the offered compass. The single-POV interiority is character-specific, avoiding stock phrasing, and his flaws drive inevitable waiting without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern breaks in moon paths and viaduct hum building to a Charged Poise closure, where the moon's balance sparks the revolution with conceptual cost of unyoking. Orientation anchors early with Elian at the basalt wall and frozen lake by ~50 words. Single extended shard fits defaults, with one meaningful deepening via the spiral map; no causality breaks, but lacks a persistent constraint shaping tactics for higher band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like the stone exhaling cold and ice as an unwritten page reflect POV bias and constrain choices, such as kneeling on thick ice for the pouch. The frozen lake and viaduct evolve causally, mirroring internal patience and charging the final sparks' reverse snowfall. Micro-setting of compass and slate constrains the closure image with tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of timing the revolution tightens through one meaningful deepening—the skewed moon path and pulsing viaduct—forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative lens, with felt cost in surrendered compass. Agency via mapping and waiting forecloses impatience, reweighting options at Charged Poise. Coherent pressure grows without coincidence resolving; moral calculus between patience and action sharpens the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of patient revolutions emerges organically from mapping patterns and quiet signals, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in restrained wildness. Subtext in images like the spiral tightening and frost-sealed pouch invites reflection on timing's cost. Final image of cooled impatience offers resonant, non-literal repricing of the premise without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with perceptual signature in Elian's biased noticing of ricochets and polarity tugs, modulating rhythm under pressure like the hum rising into ribs. Prose texture distinct in purposeful syntax and patterned diction, teaching lyric compression early. No dialogue, so policy skips; no head-hopping or elision issues, with taught patterns paying off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with sentences advancing atmosphere and character, like "words tasted of iron" embodying emotion without loops or scaffold. Rhythmic variety in varying lengths propels momentum; metaphors coherent and voice-motivated, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the sparks' reverse snowfall. Zero artifacts, with strong verbs and specific nouns enhancing propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of horizon mapping and magnetic unyoking transforms familiar revolution tropes through specific details like the 43-second pulse and compass offering. Non-obvious angle on patience feels inevitable, with risk in lyric structure heightening stakes without gimmickry. Authenticity coheres in singular vision, avoiding derivatives.</comment>
