<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to revive lost languages through painting is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in her insomnia and hopefulness, leading to an earned stasis where fatigue becomes rest; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in her wrist moving "without her" during the stroke that spells vanished cities; Jules as secondary character applies relevant pressure by inhaling the steam and sharing tea, altering the relational state subtly at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and sensory density from climbing the fire escape to the final descent, with one meaningful deepening as the brush glows and hums; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise in the "green prints" and marigolds, reweighting the city's kindness with felt cost of Mira's exhaustion; orientation anchors who (Mira), where (rooftop greenhouse), and when (night under waxing moon) by the first paragraph, waiving any test penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse constrains choices by trapping ivy and providing the potting bench for the brush, charging the final image as a "lung for the whole sleepless neighborhood"; sensory details are vivid and purposeful, like "peat and saffron quiet" mixing with bruised marigolds, filtered through Mira's hopeful bias; the smog-choked city contrasts the moonlit space, evolving causally as visions coat the glass and erase the outside view.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finishing the mural to prove strangers remember kindness tightens once as wind rattles panes and the brush glows, forcing faster painting and deepening pressure under the Accumulative lens; agency in Mira's micro-choices, like dipping the brush in indigo, forecloses isolation with Jules's arrival, at the cost of her prolonged insomnia now reframed as a "lantern"; coincidence of Jules's footsteps complicates but does not resolve, with moral calculus between fear's "soot" and kindness's "pollen."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of reviving lost kindness through art emerges organically from images like coins passed on buses and marigolds on windshields, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the "abolished tongue"; subtext in silences, like Jules standing without speaking, invites reflection on memory's endurance; the final image of smog parting on grateful exhalations offers a resonant, non-literal repricing without statement, eliciting emotional aftereffect of hopeful quiet.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-specific, with perceptual signature in Mira's synesthetic noticing of strokes sounding like "a match struck in a library"; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, lyric prose like "insomnia now a lantern," modulating with intensity without head-hopping; minimal dialogue feels natural and subtextual, as Jules offers tea "without speaking," advancing the relational shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in sentences like the hiss of syllables curling into vines, free of loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, such as air thickening "like the inside of a throat," heightening atmosphere without muddle in peak beats; clarity shines in the final line's image of the brush "ready to rouse," with high information density advancing character and theme per line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The premise of a moon-tipped brush coaxing lost languages from a mural offers fresh synthesis of art, memory, and urban kindness, feeling inevitable through Mira's particular traits; risk-taking in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes like insomnia into a "lantern" guiding revival; originality in details like indigo brewed from morning glories and rusted nails avoids echoes, committing fully to the vision.</comment>
