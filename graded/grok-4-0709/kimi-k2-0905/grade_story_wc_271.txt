<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to anchor optimism in realism is concretely rooted in somatic markers, with embodied emotions like pressing a thumb to the scar and naming Arbutus unedo to pause pain, revealing internal contradictions under grief's pressure. Interiority avoids therapy-speak by grounding in specific, contradictory impulses, such as freezing moments to dissect for mercy. The final renunciation of the photograph earns stasis with visible cost, foreclosing fixation on the past while accepting grief's coastline. No diagnostic labels mar peak beats, elevating character specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and deepenings, like the somatic anchors accumulating to the final covenant, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis with felt cost in the released photograph. Orientation anchors who (survivor), where (cliffside arboretum), and when (dusk post-lighthouse) by the first paragraph, waiving any penalty. One continuous scene fits defaults, with meaningful deepening in the freeze exercise reweighting grief. Closure lands on-page with conceptual cost, though a more persistent constraint could elevate further.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The arboretum's seaside cliff setting is vividly specific, with sensory details like wind tearing paper and resin smelling of incense and iodine, filtered through the protagonist's grief-biased perception. Environmental elements constrain choices, such as roots gripping stone mirroring desperate fingers, and charge the final image by sealing Nadia's face in resin. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly along the path to the lighthouse patch. This micro-setting elevates closure without ornamental excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, the dominant stake of surviving grief tightens through pattern breaks like the freeze exercise deepening into mercy dissection, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in tears salting the soil. One meaningful deepening suffices, narrowing options from fixation to continuation. Agency via renunciation of the photograph forecloses paths with visible price, though coincidence (wind ripping it away) complicates without resolving. Moral calculus between optimism and memory sharpens the peak without abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of anchoring optimism in realism emerges organically from somatic markers and plant motifs, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in grief as a coastline to learn. Subtext in images like the pearl of stillness reweights the premise at closure without statement. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer, eliciting emotional aftereffect through earned wisdom from particulars. No thematic echo or moralizing mars the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV maintains consistent distance, with perceptual signature biased toward botanical anchors and grief's hollow places, modulating rhythm under pressure like short breaths in the freeze. Prose texture is distinct in syntax and diction, such as "grief spikes" and "somatic map," reflecting the focalizer's mind without register drift. No dialogue or head-hopping; purposeful compression in patterned elisions pays off at closure. Elision of full backstory tilts present stance via micro-choices like tucking lavender.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with rhythmic variety, like varying sentence lengths in the freeze dissection, advancing atmosphere and character without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, such as waves detonating softer as the cliff exhales, propelling momentum. No artifacts obscure closure; information packs multiple jobs, as in resin sealing Nadia's image. Opening anchors voice, final line recharges motifs with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing grief with arboretum somatics, transforming familiar loss tropes through specific choices like mapping plants to body scars, feeling inevitable in hindsight. The core premise offers a fresh angle on survival, with risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightening stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generics, committing to the vision organically. No derivative echoes; a bolder structural risk could push higher.</comment>
