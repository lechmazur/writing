<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's cool-headed motivation is clear and intensifies through her refusal to cry out, compelling the spike's use as a high-stakes choice; interiority is concrete via embodied calm and micro-choices like exhaling silence, revealing values with felt cost in the unsung nights. Internal conflict shows in her composure against the garden's chaos, though emotions lean metaphorical without raw contradictory impulses in scene. The final renunciation of catching for conversation earns stasis with visible transformation, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds density through sonic patterns and emotional hues, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration when Mara hears "Stay" and reprices divinity as conversation; closure lands on-page with conceptual cost in the unfinished sentence and borrowed starfire. Orientation anchors who (Mara), where (sound wave garden), and when (tonight with breaking patterns) by the first sentence. One continuous scene fits scope, with pattern taught early and paid off without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vividly specific, with footsteps blooming chords and zigzag vines recoiling, constraining Mara's hunt and charging the final image of reeds straightening into lullabies; sensory details are purposeful, reflecting her calm bias and evolving causally as stars drain into the fissure. Micro-setting like the rail spike integrates as a tool that splits the sound bed, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of catching the goddess's echo signals early and deepens via the threat to burn the garden, forcing Mara's agency in driving the spike and voicing silence; under Textural lens, cadence shifts reweight options with felt cost in her exhaled unsung nights. One meaningful tightening suffices, narrowing paths to a conceptual repricing without coincidence resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of divinity as conversation emerges organically from images like the rail spike channeling silence and the garden's exhaled chord, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final hush that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like pressing her ear to the spike invites reflection on echoes needing listeners, embracing ambiguity in the unanswered question that lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Mara's selective noticing of sonic vines and indigo longing; voice has distinct poetic texture in syntax like "constellations lumber earthward like sleepwalkers," modulating rhythm under pressure without head-hopping. Patterned elision in surreal elements is taught early and legible at closure; dialogue is natural, subtextual, advancing the confrontation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in sentences like "Mara knelt, pressed her ear to the rail spike," advancing atmosphere without loops or artifacts; figurative language coheres without muddle, as in constellations bleeding envy, heightening momentum to closure. High information density layers action and image efficiently, passing read-aloud test with natural cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of surreal elements like sleepwalking constellations and voicing silence feels inevitable, transforming tropes of divine pursuit through specific stakes in the sound wave garden; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens resonance without gimmickry, committing to the premise's implications in the feral lullaby tone.</comment>
