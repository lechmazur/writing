<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to find meaning through art and insomnia is clear and intensifies, compelling her exchange with the old woman; interiority is concrete, with embodied exhaustion and contradictory impulses shown in her vigilance turning to gift. The relationship with the old woman acts as a crucible, forcing reciprocal recognition that alters Mara's state. Flaws like her artistic defeats complicate choices without safety-hedging, leading to earned endurance with felt cost in her transformed sleep.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images like rain trails and spirals, with orientation anchored early in the causeway scene; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Mara's realization and sleep, reweighting insomnia with conceptual cost. One meaningful deepening occurs as the exchange reveals buried patterns, holding the lens without contradiction. Minor elision in transitions is taught and pays off at the resonant ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tidal island setting is vivid and purposeful, with receding tide and rain trails constraining Mara's path and charging the final image of returning tide; sensory details like wet stones and bubbling frescoes reflect POV bias and evolve causally. Environment mirrors internal states subtly, such as the monastery as a "broken tooth" echoing her haggard awe. A recurring object (brooch) charges the closure by pulsing with warmth, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of threshing meaning from ruins escalates texturally through pattern accumulation and the exchange, deepening via the pottery shard and vial that reweight options with reciprocal cost. One meaningful cadence shift at sunset painting forces stance crystallization, with felt price in transformed insomnia. Coherent pressure under Accumulative lens holds, though coincidence of the old woman's appearance slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of unearthing convergence from loss emerges organically through images like shell spirals and bleeding frescoes, inviting reflection on human greed without tidy morals; the final image of dreaming spirals offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of water's memory. Subtext in gestures and silences, like the brooch's warmth, enriches complexity. Earned insight from specific exchanges avoids platitudes, meeting the 9+ test by reweighting the premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Mara's exhausted gaze making waves move; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, image-dense prose modulating with awe. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances the exchange, distinguishing characters through wry earnestness. No head-hopping, and purposeful compression in reflections is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in flowing sentences that advance atmosphere; no loops or artifacts, with strong verbs and specific details like "basalt causeway stones" propelling momentum. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak moments like the painting scene. Read-aloud flow is natural, meeting the 9+ test with zero scaffold and clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic water wars with ancient patterns and artistic vigilance transforms tropes through specific details like the amber brooch holding prehistoric insects; the core premise offers a non-obvious angle on survival and meaning. Risk in lyric structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in haggard awe avoids generics, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
