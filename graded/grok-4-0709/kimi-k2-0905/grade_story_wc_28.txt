<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Asha's motivation evolves credibly from radical idealism to nuanced mercy, with embodied interiority in her tactile cataloguing and memory release; contradictory impulses shine in the guilty relief image that renames her. The final renunciation of memories forecloses self-righteousness with felt cost, though secondary characters are absent, fitting single-POV defaults without penalty. Blind spots like her initial righteousness compound authentically before resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with patterned elision of memories building to a Conceptual Repricing closure, where the mosaic reweights knowledge as burden/blessing with conceptual cost in her departure. Orientation anchors early in the plaza under shattered sky; one meaningful deepening suffices, though ellipsis occasionally softens causality without breaking lens coherence. Final image charges options legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ancient plaza and shattered sky constrain Asha's tactile work, with tesserae as micro-setting charging the final mosaic image; sensory details like starlight and chipped patterns filter through her bias, mirroring internal fracture. Environment evolves causally from ruins to living document, guiding choices without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconciling mercy with loss tightens accumulatively through tesserae arrangement, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in releasing memories; one deepening via the mother-child image narrows options authentically under textural lens. Agency in building the map forecloses judgment, though coincidence of dawn arrival complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of mercy in forgetting emerges organically from images like burning books and infinite-armed figure, offering resonant non-literal answer that reweights knowledge without moralizing; subtext in silences and implications invites ambiguity. Final reconfiguration embraces complexity, avoiding tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV stays stable with perceptual signature in tactile, memory-biased noticing; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, image-dense syntax fitting accumulative lens. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision taught early and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose propels with high density, varying rhythm in reflective beats without loops or scaffold; metaphors like "empathy's armor" cohere without muddle, accelerating to dawn closure. Minor register drift in abstract phrases like "aberrant mercy" avoided in peaks; clarity holds under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognition and mosaic as forgetting-map transforms fire trope through specific tactile choices; risk in quiet, conceptual closure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Avoids stock archetypes via Asha's flawed evolution.</comment>
