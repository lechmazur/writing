<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to prove subtle vibrations' power is rooted in her mother's disappearance and embodied through concrete actions like adjusting the beacon and whispering into the cork, revealing contradictory impulses of tenderness and suppressed pain; however, the lack of a second on-page character limits relationship dynamics, though interior conflict drives a credible endurance with felt emotional cost at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned sensory shards toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final image of the boat's subtle course change, with conceptual cost legible in the protagonist's purified longing; orientation anchors early via the tower door and dawn, and one meaningful deepening suffices, though causality feels more poetic than strict linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse and night garden at dawn are vividly specific, with scents and light constraining choices and charging the closure—e.g., the fountain prism scattering intentions—while sensory details like jasmine and metallic rain evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism; the micro-setting of the vial cork functions as a tool that reweights the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving whispers' reach escalates texturally through scent waves and beacon pulses, culminating in a stance crystallization as the boat responds, with felt cost in enduring sorrow; one deepening via the cork's whisper suffices, driven by agency in renunciation, though coincidence in the boat's appearance slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of subtle intentions traveling far emerges organically from images like vibrating cork and night scents, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final reconfiguration of the mother's "drowning" as vibrational travel, with ambiguity lingering in unbearable love; subtext in gestures like beckoning fingers deepens complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-specific, with perceptual signature in scent-focused noticing and rhythmic syntax mirroring pulse-like vibrations; no dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation, but purposeful compression in lyric mode teaches patterns early, paying off at closure without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose density is high with vivid, multi-job sentences like "dawn bleeding across the horizon like a wound finally allowed to close," varying rhythm naturally without loops or artifacts; figurative language coheres in peak beats, propelling momentum, though occasional elevated diction slightly drifts from POV lexicon without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse mechanics with vibrational intent and night scents transforms familiar loss tropes into a non-obvious premise of purified whispers, with risk in lyric structure heightening thematic stakes; the cork's evolving role feels inevitable, avoiding derivative echoes through specific emotional truth.</comment>
