<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as an underestimated rebel is clear and intensifies through her resourceful actions, like adjusting the azimuth, revealing internal contradictions in her youthful defiance against erased histories; emotions are embodied in her sprint and key-clenching, with the final renunciation earning a felt cost as she steps out with hands raised.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned reflections and voice motifs to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final broadcast, with conceptual cost legible in the reweighted city map; orientation anchors early via the lagoon at dusk, and one meaningful deepening occurs as drones reappear, narrowing options without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The auric lagoon under starlight is vividly specific, constraining Mira's sprint and charging the closure with a glowing path that reconfigures meaning; sensory details like damp boardwalk and Orion reflections filter through her POV, mirroring her internal rebellion without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming erased voices tightens once through drone pressure, forcing her booth entry and broadcast with agency in wiring the ringer; cost is felt in her surrender, though coincidence of officer hesitation slightly softens resolution under the textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory against indifference emerges organically from concrete actions like threading the reel and recording her message, culminating in a resonant final image of braided starlight without stated morals; subtext in puddle maps and erased footsteps invites ambiguity, enriching emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in waveform tracings and starlight Morse; prose texture is poetic yet controlled, with rhythmic modulation under drone pressure, and purposeful compression in reflections pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like the sprint across planks, avoiding loops or artifacts; figurative language, such as starlight rippling like secret language, integrates without muddle, heightening atmosphere in peak beats like the booth exhale.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retro tech rebellion with puddle maps and revised histories feels inevitable, transforming tropes through Mira's specific choices; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes, as in the looping whisper, without gimmickry.</comment>
