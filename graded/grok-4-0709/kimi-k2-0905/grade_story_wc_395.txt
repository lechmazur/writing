<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in personal loss and recurring dreams, leading to a meaningful renunciation with felt cost when she opens the file and loses her employee status. Interiority is concrete and embodied, showing contradictory impulses in her decision to press the crystal despite the bargain. The single-POV focus allows deep exploration of flaws and values without needing secondary characters.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned motifs like numbers and the lullaby to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where she becomes the living archive, with conceptual cost of erasure but gain in collective memory. Orientation anchors who, where, and when early via the archive scrolling, with no disorientation debt. One meaningful deepening suffices, as the server farm discovery tightens pressure toward the charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The social network archive and polar server farm are vividly specific, with sensory details like humming crystal blocks and melting file constraining choices and charging the closure. Micro-setting elements like the patch and neural implant evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. The environment pressures the protagonist's tactics, such as lying to security, and the final empty Block 73 reweights absence thematically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering corporate lies versus personal erasure signals early and tightens once through the biometric bargain, forcing a stance crystallization with visible cost in her dimming employee file. Agency drives escalation via her choices to flex the patch and touch the crystal, reweighting options under the Accumulative lens. The ending's conceptual repricing makes the price unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of indelible memory amid corporate deletion emerges organically through recurring images like ghosts and the lullaby, culminating in a resonant, non-literal final image that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in absences and holograms invites reflection on data exploitation, with emotional honesty avoiding sentimentality. The mother's hologram revelation deepens complexity, linking personal and thematic arcs inextricably.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-specific, with perceptual signature in selective noticing of timestamps and waveforms. Prose texture is distinct, with rhythmic syntax modulating emotional intensity, and patterned elision taught early pays off at closure. No dialogue present, so no evaluation needed; no head-hopping or register mismatches.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density and propulsion with vivid, purposeful metaphors like "timestamps that pulsed like dying stars" advancing atmosphere without muddle. Zero loops or scaffolds, syntactic variety creates natural rhythm, and the final line recharges motifs effectively. Information-rich sentences multitask, with no artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi corporate conspiracy with memory motifs feels inevitable, transforming tropes like lost ships through specific details like grief-click auctions. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to the premise's implications. The non-obvious angle on deletion as waiting remembrance elevates originality.</comment>
