<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mirela's motivation to reinvent her history is clear and intensifies through embodied actions like hiding the meteorite and building the loft, revealing contradictory impulses in her trust-building; interiority is concrete, with emotions embodied in tasting iron and balancing on rafters, leading to an earned stasis in her migration; the relationship with Mr. Blackwood acts as a crucible, forcing choices that alter their dynamic with felt cost; flaws like her smuggling past complicate choices without hedging, shown in her whispered vow to Inkspot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the mosaic structure with multiple shards builds through patterned elisions and motif accumulations like dust motes and songs, teaching the pattern early via the opening attic scene; orientation anchors who (Mirela), where (attic), and when (fleeing smugglers) by ~120 words; closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing in the final dust mote image, reweighting identity as migratory with conceptual cost of erasure; one meaningful deepening occurs as months dissolve, tightening the stake without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The vintage bookshop attic setting is vivid and purposeful, with dust motes under the skylight constraining Mirela's balancing action and charging the final image; sensory details like camphor smell and cuckoo clock flutter are selective, filtered through her POV bias toward memory; spatial choreography tracks cleanly, evolving causally as she builds the loft; the micro-setting of rafters and archives mirrors her internal uncertainty, guiding choices with tactile navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving lost echoes signals early in her attic climb and tightens through one meaningful deepening as she gains balance and sanctuary, narrowing options under accumulative pressure; agency in renunciation forecloses her old path with felt cost in migration; coincidence like Mr. Blackwood's recognition complicates but doesn't resolve; moral calculus between hiding and sharing sharpens the peak, with visible price in leaving the meteorite behind.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of identities surviving through migration emerges organically from images like pigeons carrying song fragments and dust motes dancing, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in Mirela's erasure; subtext in gestures like pressing the chip into the hollow invites reflection on remembrance; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to preserving echoes, reweighting the premise without statement; emotional honesty avoids sentimentality, eliciting lingering complexity through children's humming.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature in Mirela's biased noticing of dust arpeggios and iron taste; prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, metaphorical syntax like "blooming withering light," modulating with intensity; dialogue is sparse but natural, subtextual in her whisper to Inkspot and Mr. Blackwood's offer, advancing plot; purposeful compression in shards is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences like "She exhaled, tasting iron from the meteorite chip—proof that somewhere, worlds survived collision" advancing character and atmosphere; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops or templates; figurative language is coherent, with metaphors like dust motes as notes enhancing propulsion without muddle; no artifacts obscure closure, with strong verbs and specific details propelling to the resonant final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of pigeon smuggling, meteorite, and lost songs feels organic and inevitable, transforming tropes of reinvention through specific details like micro-etched lullabies; fresh angle on memory preservation via airborne refrains avoids generics; bold risk in mosaic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; authenticity coheres in poetic voice, with the final reconfiguration growing from particulars.</comment>
