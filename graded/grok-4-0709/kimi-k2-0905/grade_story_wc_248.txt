<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ember's motivation to rescue her grandmother's promise is clear and intensifies through her pyromaniac traits, compelling higher-stakes revelations; interiority is concrete with embodied contradictions, like tracing walls with "volcanic tenderness" revealing dual impulses. Internal conflict shows simultaneous destructive and preservative urges in scene, not summaries. The final endurance forecloses her old arsonist path with felt conceptual cost, earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and revelations to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Ember reweights destruction as preservation, with undeniable conceptual cost in the archive's collapse. Orientation anchors who (Ember), where (archive), and when (after going off-grid) by ~120 words. One meaningful deepening suffices, with the tapestry's glow reconfiguring knowledge on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive is vividly specific with soot-stained walls, old parchment scent, and warm threads, constraining Ember's choices and charging the final image of collapse. Sensory details like lavender and sulfur are purposeful, filtered through her POV bias. The micro-setting of the tapestry fragment as a recurring object evolves causally, mirroring her internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rescuing the forgotten promise tightens through one meaningful deepening as the tapestry reveals the message, forcing stance crystallization under the Accumulative lens with felt cost in the collapsing archive. Internal conflict interweaves with external descent, narrowing options via her analytical decoding. Agency in her renunciation of pure destruction forecloses paths with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of destruction's role in preservation emerges organically from events like the tapestry's reweaving and Ember's realizations, without direct statements. Subtext in images like glowing threads and scratched-out portrait invites reflection on knowledge's dual nature. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer reweighting the premise with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with controlled distance, perceptual signature biased toward fiery metaphors fitting Ember's mind. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax like "volcanic tenderness," modulating with intensity. Patterned elision in reflections is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, high information density in lines like "the fire remembers" advancing theme and character. No significant loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent, voice-motivated, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the glowing tapestry. Clarity and concision maintain momentum to the resonant final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arson as artistic revelation transforms the trope through specific details like chemical coordinates in paintings, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in poetic structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on preservation via destruction, cohering as singular vision.</comment>
