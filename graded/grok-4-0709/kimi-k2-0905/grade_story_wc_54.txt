<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as a curious intern drives consistent, intensifying choices rooted in her functional creativity, with embodied emotions shown through actions like sorting valves and soldering; internal conflict emerges in her stoic wonder, balancing competence with genuine struggle, though secondary characters like the crowd feel underdeveloped as crucibles for her growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through descriptive shards to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the beacon and laugh reweight the terminal from abandonment to refuge with conceptual cost of redirected possibilities; orientation anchors early in the spaceport, but the cutoff ending slightly weakens cadence shift payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport setting vividly constrains Mara's choices, with sensory details like cracked tiles and ion-storm damage mirroring her hope equations, and the hydroponic atrium as a micro-setting directly enabling the rerouting action that charges the final refuge image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake of puzzling hope equations tightens through one meaningful deepening in rerouting flows, narrowing options with felt cost of structural kindness, though pressure remains more textural than escalating reversals, with coincidence in finding the sextant complicating but not resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of redirecting flows for hope emerges organically from Mara's actions and the sextant motif, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights departure to arrival without moralizing; subtext in images like the maze of intentions invites ambiguity on exile and return.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV filters perceptions through Mara's engineering bias, with distinct rhythmic prose modulating under stoic wonder; perceptual signature shines in lines like "feeling for vibrations," and purposeful compression teaches patterns paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, propulsion-driven sentences like "starlight poured in clean lines," varying rhythm naturally without loops or artifacts; figurative language coheres, accelerating momentum to the beacon's pulse, though one minor synonym cycle in nutrient descriptions slightly dulls a beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of civil engineering and sci-fi hope transforms familiar abandonment tropes through specific details like the sextant-charged beacon, with bold risk in textural accumulation heightening thematic stakes; the core premise feels inevitable, avoiding stock echoes.</comment>
