<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alya's motivation to reclaim hope through engineering is clear and intensifies via concrete actions like rerouting glycol, revealing character under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied wonder, as in her spoken equation startling the rat; however, internal conflict lacks sharp contradictory impulses, trending toward poetic consistency rather than crisis-driven flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Structure builds accumulatively with textural density increasing toward closure, where the spinning coin and laughing valve provide a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost of reclaimed yet stagnant futures; orientation anchors early in the abandoned terminal; one meaningful deepening suffices, but causality feels more poetic than tightly linked.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting vividly constrains choices, with the utility core's rust and conduits shaping Alya's rerouting actions and charging the final birds' flight; sensory details like crunching tickets and glycol taste are selective and POV-biased, mirroring her stoic wonder; the spaceport evolves causally, heightening atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resurrecting hope tightens through one deepening via the hologram's advice, forcing stance crystallization under accumulative lens; cost is felt in the inward vectors of failed departures, but pressure remains more conceptual than visceral, with no sharp reversal narrowing options dramatically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming wonder from stagnation emerges organically through images like the Möbius confession and final equation, offering resonant ambiguity without moralizing; subtext in the architect's hologram reweights the premise with complexity; the ending's charged poise elicits lingering emotional aftereffect tied to hope's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature in Alya's engineering-biased noticing, like valves in prayer attitudes; prose texture is distinct with rhythmic, patterned diction that teaches lyric compression early; brief dialogue with hologram feels natural and advances subtext without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the rat's fleeing cap rotating as a planet; no loops or artifacts obscure clarity, and metaphors cohere without muddle, propelling momentum to the final image; information advances atmosphere and character seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi abandonment with carnival ghosts and engineering resurrection feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like the sextant shard's meridians; risk in lyric structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, committing to stoic wonder's authenticity.</comment>
