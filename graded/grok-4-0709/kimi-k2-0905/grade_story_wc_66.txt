<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mila's motivation to preserve stories through transcription is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in her traits as a diligent copyist, with actions like weaving copper filaments revealing her under pressure. Interiority is concrete, showing embodied longing via pencil hovering and rosin use, though internal conflict lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The meaningful endurance in the climax earns stasis with felt cost, as she stays to copy amid chaos. Voice distinction is strong in her perceptual specificity, but secondary characters like inspectors apply pressure without deep status dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds with density increasing through repeated nights and phrases, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where dust narrates, reweighting the story famine with conceptual cost legible in the inspectors' transformation and lingering mist. Orientation anchors who (Mila), where (alcove), and when (post-famine nights to solstice) early, with purposeful disorientation in mist paying off at closure. Structure fits mosaic track with legible time jumps teaching the pattern by 25%, and one meaningful deepening tightens to the transmit moment. Cost is felt in the airborne score and uniforms shedding ash, shaping the final image without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ember alcove and mist are vivid, purposeful micro-settings that constrain choices, like mist tasting of iron and crouching, pressuring the solstice transmission and charging the final image of mist carrying chords. Sensory details are selective, biased through Mila's trained ear, integrating into action like rosin dust lifting. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, with music stands as antennae evolving causally. The environment mirrors internal rebellion subtly, without overt symbolism, and recurs to heighten atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of amplifying forbidden stories signals early and deepens through accumulative pressure, with the solstice transmission as a meaningful cadence shift forcing stance crystallization and narrowing options against Ministry threat. Agency in Mila's endurance forecloses silence with visible cost in inhaled chords staggering inspectors. Coincidence of broadcast timing complicates but doesn't resolve; moral calculus between rebellion and safety sharpens the peak. Escalation is driven by her choices under the textural lens, with unmistakable on-page cost in the hall's fog of sound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of stories' resilience emerges organically from images like rosin dust vibrating and mist as testimony, inviting reflection on censorship without tidy morals, with ambiguity in passersby's furrowed brows. Subtext in intervals encoding emotions and the final non-literal answer reweights the famine premise through conceptual repricing. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars like inspectors mouthing words, avoiding sentimentality. Resonance builds from character complexity, with the core concept integrated via the broadcast's elusive lyrics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in musical metaphors like melody bending through stained glass, and rhythmic control varying syntax to heighten pressure without head-hopping. Purposeful compression in time jumps is taught early and paid off at closure, with diction like "thistled calm" voice-motivated and consistent. Narrative stance modulates with intensity, prose reflecting Mila's mind in fragmented, luminous perceptions. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; elision of routine nights imposes friction that changes tactics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in sentences like mist curling like sheet music, advancing atmosphere and character without loops or scaffold; information layers multiple jobs, like green phosphor painting fingers. Figurative language is coherent, voice-driven, with no muddle in peak beats like the chord filling the hall. Clarity shines in precise sequencing, strong verbs, and purposeful punctuation; final line recharges motifs with high density. Zero artifacts, with syntactic variety breathing in step with accumulative buildup.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of encoding stories in musical dust offers fresh synthesis of dystopia and artistry, feeling inevitable through Mila's specific choices like rosin ink, transforming tropes of rebellion with non-obvious ingenuity. Risk-taking in textural, mosaic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, cohering as a singular vision. Emotional specificity in teaching dust avoids generics, with the final reconfiguration arising from established patterns. No close echoes of famous works; boldness elevates coherence.</comment>
