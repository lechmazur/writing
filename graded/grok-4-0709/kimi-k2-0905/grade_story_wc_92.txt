<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Garnet's motivation to ignite a revolution is clear and intensifies through embodied impulses like the "cradle of sparks," compelling her lock-picking and schematic use; interiority is concrete with contradictory obedience turning to invention, shown in her graphite tracing and mask-dropping at closure. Luce's calmly inventive trait pressures their alliance effectively, though secondary characters like Voss apply pressure without deep status dynamics. Flaws complicate choices authentically, with Garnet's obedience mask enabling deception, earning a meaningful change at the end with felt cost in the drifting barges. The final whisper to the wind reveals her value hierarchy, charging the reconfiguration without stock epiphanies.</comment>

No overt symbolism or statements; resonance arises from the fort's inhaled possibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV on Garnet is stable, with perceptual signature in spark cradles and wax smells biasing notices; brief shifts to Luce are sectioned cleanly without head-hopping. Voice texture distinct in poetic rhythm and syntax, modulating with pressure like exhaled sighs under stress. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and subtextual, advancing plot via whispers on sparks and chains. Patterned elision in dream-rehearsed intrigue is taught early and pays off at closure, with no unwarranted certainty.</comment>
