<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ilay's motivation to revive music is fiercely rooted in her symphonically minded traits, driving concrete micro-choices like mapping cracks as pitches; interiority is embodied through slowed heartbeat and resin-scarred fingers, with the final endurance earning a visible cost in trembling knees without stock epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned sensory deepenings from hush to symphony, with orientation anchored by the grove and statue early; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost in the grove's reawakened mercy, though one more explicit tightening could elevate inevitability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The siskin alder grove constrains choices through its hush and needles, charging the final image with trembling air and mercy; sensory details like resin scents and moss jade are selective, POV-biased, and evolve causally, mirroring Ilay's empathy without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of creating music in silence escalates via textural density from mapping cracks to strumming, with one meaningful deepening forcing stance crystallization under the Accumulative lens; cost is felt in the statue's exhaling sorrow-to-comfort, though coincidence in the grove's response slightly softens agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of empathy in motion emerges organically from Ilay's actions stitching fractures into melody, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer where sorrow learns comfort; subtext in silent vibrations and potential invites reflection on revival without moralizing or false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual signature in symphonic mapping of cracks; prose texture in rhythmic syntax like "softer, softer" modulates with pressure, and her brief spoken numbering distinguishes voice without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose propels with high density in lines like the crack shaped as a siskin's wing, varying rhythm from hush to ping without loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, accelerating momentum to the fading overtone with zero scaffold in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sculpture, insulators, and arboreal music transforms familiar revival tropes through specific details like copper-veined porcelain and fungal webs; risk in intensely quiet tone heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable without gimmickry or echoes.</comment>
