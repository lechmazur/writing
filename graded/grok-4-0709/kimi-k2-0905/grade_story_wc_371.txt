<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mila's motivation as a noticer is clear and intensifies through gentle actions like planting bread, revealing internal contradictions in her fear of amnesia versus cultivation of memory; emotions are embodied in tasting crumbs and tears salting crust, with micro-choices like offering the bread driving the arc. The gardener provides secondary pressure, forcing relational choices that alter the state by the end. Flaws complicate choices without hedging, leading to an earned stasis in ongoing vigilance. The final renunciation of forgetting is earned with visible emotional cost in her tears and soil under nails.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern of shards building through images of bread, gardens, and uncloaking, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the sacred is revealed as continuous, with conceptual cost of tenuous absolution made undeniable in the final image of shoots spelling names. Orientation anchors early in the palace and Rue des Aubes, with mosaic structure (multiple shards) taught by 25% via recurring normality noticing, legible transitions, and coherent closure. One meaningful deepening suffices, as bread planting reweights knowledge of memory. Persistent constraint of city's drift shapes tactics, charging the closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting vividly anchors in the overgrown palace courtyard and narrowing alleys, with sensory details like tea-steam sighs and flour ghosts filtered through Mila's bias, constraining choices like planting at intersections. Atmosphere of hush and frost supports the theme of tenuous memory, evolving causally as mosaics brighten and shops reopen. The tea house as micro-setting pressures actions and charges the final image of brewing tea among ruins. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across moonlight moves and commuter paths.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of combating creeping normality tightens through guerrilla gardening, with one meaningful deepening as crumbs uncloak erased streets, forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative lens. Agency in planting forecloses passive noticing, with felt cost in tears and ongoing liturgy against forgetting. Pressure coheres via internal want (absolution) versus fear (amnesia), with ethical calculus in cultivating memory. Cost is unmistakable in the emotional price of realization, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of sacred in the ordinary emerges organically from bread planting and uncloaking, with subtext in gestures like soil under nails and resonant ambiguity in tenuous absolution without tidy morals. Final image of shoots greeting birds offers non-literal answer, reweighting premise with conceptual cost of continuous cultivation. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars like tears salting crust, avoiding sentimentality. Protagonist's arc inextricable from thematic question of memory versus forgetting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stable with perceptual signature in noticing drifts and bread warmth, diction poetic yet character-specific in phrases like "heuristically gentle." Voice modulates rhythmically with pressure, as in moonlight sighs, with patterned elision taught early and paid off in closure. Dialogue natural and subtextual, like "Guilt rises like yeast; plant it," advancing plot via implication. No head-hopping; elision of time changes legible and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose rhythmic and propulsive with varied syntax, high density in images like "flour ghosts" advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold; no figurative muddle, as metaphors like yeast guilt cohere logically. Clarity and concision shine in opening hush to final widening morning, with strong verbs and specific nouns. Zero artifacts in peak beats, like frost night realization. Final line recharges motifs with integrated grace.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of urban forgetting with guerrilla gardening and bread as memory, feeling inevitable through Mila's noticer role; risk in mosaic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Tropes of loss transformed via specific details like basil spelling shop names. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on absolution, committing fully without retreat. Emotional specificity in cultivating sacred avoids generics, with bold lyric risk elevating coherence.</comment>
