<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to thresh meaning from garbled signals intensifies compellingly, rooted in her confident uncertainty, leading to the earned stasis of embracing edits with visible emotional cost in the floating moment. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses like regret and steadying uncertainty driving micro-choices, such as poising the nib despite doubts. The single-POV focus excels in showing her flaws complicating the rewrite without secondary characters, though the mentor's memory feels slightly stock in revealing her hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elisions and motif accrual to a resonant reconfiguration where editing unbends the event, with felt cost in borrowed power and shifting gravity. Orientation anchors early with Mira at the viewport on Station Lagrange-9, and the single continuous scene with one meaningful deepening (the rewrite) fits scope without transitions. Closure lands on-page via conceptual repricing of "wrong seeds" as "early," charging the final image of whispering back with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly constrains choices vividly, pressuring Mira's rewrite and charging the final image of warmth through boots, functioning as a dynamic micro-setting that evolves causally. Sensory details like recycled air taste and anomaly glow are selective, POV-biased, and purposeful, mirroring her uncertainty without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, with gravity shifts affecting her float and landing, heightening atmosphere in service of theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of interpreting signals escalates through density increase in filament naming and rewrite, culminating in a cadence shift that reweights uncertainty as comfort with felt cost in dimmed lights and slackened gravity. One meaningful deepening narrows options, forcing her stance crystallization without coincidence resolving. Agency via renunciation of certainty forecloses confusion, though the ethical calculus feels understated in the peak choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty in interpretation emerges organically from images like pruning branches and contingent filaments, culminating in a resonant, non-literal final image of spirals ready to be misunderstood correctly. Subtext in the pen's vibration and anomaly's lullaby invites reflection on editing reality without tidy morals, eliciting emotional aftereffect through her trembling voice. The core concept integrates tightly, with ambiguity lingering meaningfully in future loops.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with controlled psychic distance modulates effectively, perceptual signature biased toward poetic glyphs and star-whispers, teaching patterned diction early for legibility at closure. Prose texture distinct in rhythmic syntax like "confidence flickered; uncertainty steadied her hand," heightening emotional beats without head-hopping. Her whispered dialogue advances the arc with subtext, pursuing reconciliation with the cosmos.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose propels with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the pen scratching absence that glowed, avoiding loops or scaffold while advancing atmosphere through concrete images. Figurative language coheres without muddle, though occasional elevated diction like "light-cones" borders register drift but fits POV. Final line resolves by recharging motifs with propulsion, passing read-aloud test cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise of editing history via contingent relationships offers fresh synthesis in a sci-fi gardening metaphor, transforming tropes through Mira's specific emotional truth and bold risk in nonlinear causality. Originality shines in the pen as emotional relic, with the anomaly humming an apology-invitation feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, though proximity to familiar time-edit concepts caps ingenuity slightly.</comment>
