<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The oracle's motivation to externalize the swallowed truth is clear and intensifies through embodied contradictions, like the rootlet piercing her diaphragm, compelling a renunciation with visible cost in the expulsion; interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing; the single-POV focus excels in showing flawed limits driving inevitable struggle without needing secondary characters.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and cadence shifts to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the stone's expulsion, with conceptual cost legible in the temporary innocence; orientation anchors early in the weather station awakening; one meaningful deepening suffices, with the aurora triggering the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The mountain weather station setting constrains choices through instruments and snow, charging the final image of the bundle in the rain gauge; sensory details like hissing snow and auroral light are vivid, POV-filtered, and evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of weighing the internal truth escalates texturally through density increases like smudged illustrations and rootlet pain, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in the expulsion; one deepening via the aurora suffices, though coincidence complicates without resolving; agency in deliberate smudging drives the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth's burdensome weight emerges organically from images like the seed sprouting and auroral sorrow, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the evacuated stone without moralizing; subtext in peripheral certainties invites reflection on protection's cost; emotional aftereffect lingers through complex ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person is stable with controlled distance, perceptual signature in marginal awareness and sensory bias; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, lyric compression that teaches patterns early and pays off at closure; no dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, no loops or artifacts; metaphors like "breath blooming like shattered glass" are coherent and heighten momentum without muddle; information density high, with lines advancing atmosphere and character; final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle mythology with meteorological specificity feels inevitable, transforming tropes through peripheral certainties and auroral sorrow; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; core premise commits fully, avoiding generic abstractions.</comment>
