<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to recover her mother's lost lyrics and unused love is clear and intensifies through embodied actions like handling the film strip, revealing contradictory impulses in her whispered chorus and tearful release. Interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions embodied in tingling fingertips and glowing warmth, avoiding stock phrasing. The final renunciation of the envelope as ashes earns a meaningful change with felt emotional cost, foreclosing isolation. Flaws complicate choices authentically, as her spatial imagination overlays gloom with brightness, driving inevitable discoveries without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds with patterned images building to a conceptual repricing in the final image of love hatching and rain applauding, delivering resonant reconfiguration with felt cost in tears and release. Orientation anchors who (Mara), where (abandoned Orion Palace booth), and when (stormy night) by the first 120 words without disorientation. One meaningful deepening occurs as the film self-threads, tightening pressure toward closure. Minor ellipsis in visions feels motivated but slightly softens causality at the splice moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The vintage movie palace booth is vividly anchored with dust, rusted reels, and a tiny window framing the auditorium, constraining choices like descending stairs drawn by the beam. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, balancing visual monochrome light with tactile celluloid and auditory hushed thunder, reflecting Mara's urgency. The setting evolves causally, with the projector creaking to life and rain drumming outside, mirroring internal release. A recurring object (film strip) charges the final image by threading into her chest, elevating specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding unused love signals early and deepens once through the self-threading film, reweighting options under the accumulative lens with felt cost in tears blurring ink. Pressure coheres via interwoven internal (grief) and external (storm, projector) conflicts, forcing stance crystallization in singing the tune. One meaningful cadence shift at the hatching love narrows paths, with agency in scratching new lyrics foreclosing unresolved goodbye. Coincidence of the film's movement complicates but does not resolve, maintaining earned resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unused love as stored and projectable emerges organically from images like the self-threading film and hatching warmth, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the mother's postscript. Subtext in gestures like breaking the seal and envelope ashes invites reflection on release without confusion. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting love as looped and spliceable, eliciting emotional aftereffect through concrete particulars. Epiphanies earn through struggle, avoiding platitudes or false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV maintains controlled distance, with perceptual signature in Mara's spatial overlays and biased noticing of nitrate smells. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, image-dense syntax that modulates with intensity, like fragmented visions under stress. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; purposeful compression in visions is taught early and pays off at closure. Diction fits POV lexicon without register shifts, and rhythmic control heightens pressure in the singing climax without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with sentences advancing atmosphere and character, like "dust floated like slow film frames," varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold. Clarity and concision propel momentum, weaving metaphors cohesively without muddle or register drift in peak beats. Information layers multiple jobs, showing through concrete images like pigeons fluttering as sprocket holes. Zero artifacts touch closure, with syntactic variety supporting emphasis in the resonant rain drumming.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry with film projection transforms tropes of abandonment into a non-obvious loop of stored love, feeling inevitable through Mara's spatial imagination. Emotional specificity in hatching warmth avoids generic templates, with risk-taking in self-moving film heightening stakes organically. Core premise commits to implications without retreat, subverting familiar ghost-story echoes via conceptual integrity. One fresh inflection in scratching lyrics reconfigures the ending boldly without gimmickry.</comment>
