<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as a witness is clear and intensifies through her tapping habit and descent, with embodied interiority like the "eel waking in her chest" revealing contradictory impulses of grief and curiosity. The final realization earns stasis by foreclosing passive observation for active remembrance, with felt emotional cost. No secondary characters, so relationship bullets are ignored; single-POV interiority is concrete without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern breaks like the tapping response and atlas insertion building to a Conceptual Repricing closure, where Mira's role reweights from loss to regrowth with conceptual cost of hidden knowledge. Orientation anchors early in the station and lagoon; one meaningful deepening via the submersible descent narrows options. Closure lands on-page with the station as "gate ajar," charging the final image without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sea level monitoring station and underwater ridge are vivid with purposeful sensory details like "hollow sheen" and "green tunnels," constraining choices such as descending via submersible and charging the closure with the station's silhouette as a gate. Atmosphere mirrors internal revelation through moonlight and silt clouds, with micro-setting like pillars enabling the hologram payoff. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from ladder to seafloor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering hidden paths signals early and tightens once through the descent and insertion, forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative lens with felt cost of grief in the hologram's fade. Agency via Mira's actions drives escalation without coincidence resolving; moral calculus between forgetting and remembering sharpens the peak. One deepening suffices, but lacks a second visible price for higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of hidden regeneration after loss emerges organically from tapping patterns and the hologram, with subtext in images like "broken teeth" and "gate ajar" inviting reflection on memory's cost. Ending offers resonant, non-literal repricing without moralizing, reweighting the premise via the atlas seal. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature in rhythmic, poetic texture like "three short, two long," modulating under pressure without head-hopping or elision issues. Prose reflects Mira's mind through selective noticing of salt-feathered edges and pings; no dialogue to evaluate. Patterned diction teaches compression early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid metaphors like "white mantis" and "eel waking" advancing atmosphere without muddle, varying rhythm for propulsion in descent beats. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; sentences multitask, as in the tapping that wakes batteries while revealing character. Final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of climate witness with mythic underwater discovery transforms eco-tropes through specific details like "Path 27" and hologram pillars, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk in poetic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; core premise commits to hidden regrowth without retreat. Emotional complexity via grief avoids generics.</comment>
