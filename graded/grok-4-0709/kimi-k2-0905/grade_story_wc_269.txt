<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as a witness is clear and intensifies through her habits and discoveries, compelling her descent and realization; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like the "eel waking in her chest" revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. The meaningful endurance in her role forecloses isolation with a felt cost of perpetual vigilance, shown in the resuming tapping. Flaws complicate choices authentically, avoiding stereotypes, though secondary characters are absent, fitting single-POV defaults.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elisions and revelations, with orientation anchored early in the station and Mira's role; closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing where the reef's hidden data reweights her witness duty with conceptual cost, evident in the final image of the station as a "gate left ajar." One meaningful deepening via the atlas page and pings tightens pressure coherently. No causality breaks, with motifs like tapping teaching the pattern effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sea level monitoring station anchors the setting vividly, constraining choices like the submersible descent, with sensory details like "moonlight painted the station a drifting moored specter" reflecting Mira's perceptual bias. Atmosphere evolves causally, mirroring internal revelation, and the underwater ridge charges the final image by revealing hidden paths. Micro-setting of pillars and atlas slot integrates action tactilely, enhancing thematic resonance without ornamental excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of witnessing loss signals early and deepens through the summons, with one meaningful tightening in the submersible descent narrowing options to confrontation; pressure accumulates texturally, forcing stance crystallization in the hologram revelation. Cost is felt conceptually in accepting her role's endurance, though coincidence of the pings complicates without resolving. Agency via micro-choices like inserting the page earns the reconfiguration without multiple reversals required.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of hidden remembrance emerges organically from images like the torn atlas and projected reef, inviting reflection on loss and renewal without tidy morals; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by repricing Mira's grief as invitation. Subtext in tapping rhythms and "drifting moored" builds ambiguity that lingers meaningfully. No explicit statements mar the emotional honesty, though complexity avoids false equivalence effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature in selective noticing like "tapping felt different" biased by Mira's history; prose texture distinct in rhythmic syntax mirroring the tapping motif. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; purposeful compression in lyric mode teaches patterns early, paying off at closure without head-hopping. Distance shifts intentionally with emotional intensity, maintaining coherence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences like "the ocean still clenched its dead reefs like broken teeth" advancing atmosphere and character; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops or scaffold, with syntactic variety supporting propulsion. Figurative language is controlled, consistent, and purpose-driven without muddle in peak beats like the descent. No artifacts obscure clarity, and final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of climate witness with hidden ancient tech feels inevitable through specifics like "Path 27" and tapping code, transforming eco-loss tropes via personal revelation. Risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise authentically. No close echoes of famous works, with emotional specificity anchoring universality.</comment>
