<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to trace honest origins is clear and intensifies through concrete interiority, culminating in her decision to rewrite the index with a felt cost of challenging false history. Interior conflict shows in her shifting hypotheses and embodied reactions, like the tingling stamp imprint listening to her pulse. The single-POV focus allows deep embodiment without needing relationship dynamics, and her flaws drive inevitable realizations without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned realizations and sensory deepenings to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Mara reweights the catalogue's erasure with undeniable conceptual cost, evident in her new ledger column. Orientation anchors who (Mara), where (flooded library), and when (blackout) by the first paragraph, serving the closure payoff. One meaningful deepening suffices, with causality in absences and imprints driving the resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The sunken library's flooded atrium constrains Mara's choices, like wading through water and working by touch, directly charging the final image of surfacing with streaming water echoing truths. Sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, balancing visual algae glow with tactile indentations and auditory drips, evolving causally as water rises. Micro-setting of the catalogue drawers pressures her tactics without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering the catalogue's origins tightens through one meaningful deepening via the stamp's revelation in darkness, forcing stance crystallization under the Accumulative lens with felt cost in her dappled resolve. Agency in extinguishing the lantern and pressing the stamp drives escalation, narrowing options without coincidence resolving. Moral calculus between forgetting and remembering sharpens the peak, though secondary accents are minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of erasure versus remembrance emerges organically from particulars like bruised cards and the glyph's street map, culminating in a resonant, non-literal final image of the wrist mark reminding that knowledge begins where silence is stamped back. Subtext in implications of suppression invites reflection on governed histories without tidy morals. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through complex ambiguity in her private pressure holding false history at bay.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with character-specific perceptual signature in tranquil perceptions of stillness and neural static, modulating rhythm under pressure like shortening sentences in darkness. Prose texture is distinct in syntax and diction, with purposeful compression in realizations paying off at closure. No dialogue or head-hopping, and elisions are taught early through hypotheses, maintaining legibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with sentences advancing atmosphere and character, like "phosphorescent plankton briefly outlined the glyph," without loops or scaffold; rhythmic variety breathes with scene needs, varying paragraph lengths. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, enhancing propulsion without muddle in peak beats like the darkness revelation. Zero artifacts touch closure, with strong verbs and specific nouns driving momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sunken city lore with catalogue erasure feels inevitable through specific details like the stamp's glyph mirroring streets, transforming tropes of lost knowledge with bold risk in textural accumulations heightening stakes. Premise offers fresh angle on memory and governance without echoes, committing fully with authenticity. Emotional specificity in dappled resolve avoids generics, making the vision singular.</comment>
