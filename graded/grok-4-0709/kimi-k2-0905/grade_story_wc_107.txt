<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to craft safe zones roots deeply in her grief, shown through embodied contradictions like her unguarded laugh startling her, revealing internal conflict without therapy-speak. The emotional progression culminates in a credible tectonic shift, foreclosing isolation with felt cost in the thawing heart. Narration as micro-choices under pressure distinguishes her voice and hierarchy of values effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and deepening introspection in one continuous scene, with orientation anchored by the first sentence. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise, where leaving the dome reweights her grief with conceptual cost in the final whispered invitation and departure. One meaningful deepening suffices, though causality feels more textural than causal, slightly softening linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The thawing control room constrains choices vividly, with drip-lines and ice crashes mirroring Mara's internal melt and enabling her crafting, charging the final image of silver puddles. Sensory details like metallic scent and cardamom steam are selective, POV-biased, and evolve causally, heightening atmosphere without stalling momentum. Micro-setting of consoles and furnace integrates action tactilely, fulfilling the 9+ test by shaping the closure's reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of emotional thawing escalates texturally through narration and crafting, with one deepening in the laugh that crystallizes her stance, foreclosing guarded sorrow with felt cost. Agency via renunciation drives the ending under the lens, though pressure remains internal and subtle, lacking a sharper external complication. Coherent but could narrow options more viscerally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sheltering curiosity amid grief emerges organically from glass dome and bookmark motifs, reweighted in the final image without moralizing, offering resonant ambiguity in "Enter, wonder, argue, forgive." Subtext in thawing imagery and narration invites reflection on loss's complexity, avoiding sentimentality. Fulfills 9+ test with non-literal reconfiguration of safe zones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Close third-person POV remains stable and character-specific, with perceptual signature in metallic scents and thawing drops filtered through Mara's bias. Voice texture shines in rhythmic, purposeful syntax like "weightless yet weighty," modulating under emotional intensity without elision issues. Self-dialogue feels natural, advancing introspection with subtext, meeting the 9+ test for rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, propulsion-driven sentences like "boots splashing silver puddles," varying rhythm naturally without loops or artifacts. Figurative language coheres, enhancing momentum in peak beats like the dome's cooling, with zero scaffold and clean mechanics. Meets 9+ test fully, integrating multiple jobs per line flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of glassblowing, narration, and thawing motifs transforms grief tropes into a fresh, inevitable reconfiguration, with risk in lyric structure heightening stakes without gimmickry. Perspective feels memorable through particular details like mercury dreams, committing to the premise authentically. Close to 9+ but lacks one bolder non-obvious inflection.</comment>
