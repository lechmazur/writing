<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation for seeking psychological safety is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like planting the eye instead of burying it, revealing contradictory impulses between rationality and involuntary truthfulness. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with emotions like guilt over the sister manifesting in actions rather than labels. The final endurance earns stasis by confronting flaws with visible cost, as in offering the truffle to the ghost without apology. Voice distinction shines in the singular, poetic idiom, though secondary characters like the sister appear briefly without full status dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned shards of foraging, storms, and confessions, with legible transitions via time folds like "Days folded into weeks." Orientation anchors early in the ravine orchard post-plague, serving closure by charging the confessional reconfiguration. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost, reweighting truth as grace in the final image of harvesting eyes; one meaningful deepening via the eye's planting suffices. No causality breaks, though ellipsis is motivated by the relic's curse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The hanging orchard in the ravine is vividly specific, with sensory details like branches in mist and storm-pruned trees constraining choices, such as climbing for cures. Atmosphere builds tension through weather affecting confessions, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. The setting evolves causally, from soil-turning to eye-harvesting, charging the final image of lanterns refracting grace. Micro-setting like the glass eye functions as a tool that reweights vision and truth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of cultivating safety tightens through the curse's deepening pressure, forcing confessions during storms and narrowing options like burying versus planting the eye. One meaningful cadence shift via the blooming eyes crystallizes stance, with felt cost in blurred vision and absorbed guilt. Agency shines in the protagonist's renunciation of rationality, though coincidence of finding the eye complicates without resolving. Moral calculus between truth's wound and grace earns the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of fractured grace emerges organically from images like storm-pruned trees and refracting eyes, embracing complexity without tidy morals. Subtext in silences, such as not apologizing to the ghost, invites reflection on empathy's mutation. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by repricing truth as composted fruit, eliciting emotional aftereffect through particulars. No overt statements; ambiguity lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, filtering through rational yet poetic noticing like "fruit glowing pale as moonlit bones." Prose texture in rhythmic syntax and patterned diction teaches compression, paying off at closure without head-hopping. Elision of time is motivated and legible under the textural lens. Minimal dialogue feels natural, though sparse; no register mismatches.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like wind threading "like piano wire" to propel atmosphere without loops. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, avoiding muddle in peaks like the planting beat. Minor scaffold in repetitive storm motifs is pattern-taught and advances momentum. Clarity shines in the final line's cutoff, charging resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes post-plague isolation with a truth-forcing relic in an upside-down orchard, feeling fresh through specific inflections like planting the eye to grow confessional fruit. Risk-taking in surreal mosaic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes of curses into grace. Emotional specificity avoids generics, with the ghost's truffle-eating reprising guilt organically. Bold commitment to the vision coheres without hedging.</comment>
