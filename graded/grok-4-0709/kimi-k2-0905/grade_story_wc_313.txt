<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marisol's motivation is clear and intensifies through personal history, culminating in an earned renunciation of private grief with visible emotional cost in the final tearing of the label. Interiority is concrete and embodied, showing contradictory impulses like duty versus forbidden nostalgia in the liqueur memory. The single-POV focus excels in revealing flaws and values through micro-choices, such as pocketing the label as "evidence."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered discoveries with coherent orientation anchored by the first paragraph's wind chime and levee office. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing via the label-tearing and photographing, reweighting private scandal to shared memory with felt emotional cost in the "mirrored hush inside her chest." One meaningful deepening suffices, though the photo trail's causality feels slightly pat without stronger setup friction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The resurfacing reservoir town is vividly specific, with sensory details like "ankle-deep silt" and "slime" on the path constraining Marisol's descent and charging the final ridgeway image under stars. Atmosphere mirrors internal hush, evolving causally as water retreats to reveal structures that drive discoveries. Micro-setting of the lounge and ridgeway pressures choices, meeting the 9+ test by shaping the closure's reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of personal grief versus shared survival tightens through the photo trail's deepening revelations, forcing a stance crystallization under the Accumulative lens with emotional cost in releasing "private grief." Agency via renunciation forecloses solitary duty, though coincidence of the intact bottle slightly complicates without fully resolving. One meaningful intensification suffices, but stakes remain somewhat internal without sharper external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of resurfacing pasts as shared rather than private burdens emerges organically from images like the winking swan and torn label, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final "living text" without moralizing. Subtext in photographs and the father's note invites ambiguity about choice and duty. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars, though the ending's optimism slightly tidies complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature in selective noticing like the "anise and rain" taste biasing memories. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, image-rich syntax that modulates with emotional intensity, such as shortening in the descent. No dialogue, but purposeful compression teaches patterns paid off at closure, meeting the 9+ test without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density and propulsion with vivid, multi-job sentences like the wind chime's "metallic sigh," varying rhythm naturally without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, accelerating in peak beats like the photo trail without muddle. Zero scaffold or redundancy, with strong verbs and specific nouns enhancing clarity, though one mixed metaphor ("damp gauze") is a hairline slip not touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise of a resurfacing drowned town revealing personal secrets offers fresh ingenuity, transforming flood tropes through specific details like the photo trail and engineer's note. Risk-taking in quiet, reflective structure heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Originality shines in synthesizing memory and landscape, though it echoes familiar submerged-past motifs without full subversion.</comment>
