<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marisol's motivation to transform memories is clear and intensifies through embodied sensory experiences, with internal contradictions shown in her reversal from erasing to honoring grief; emotions are vividly embodied, as in her knees buckling under oceanic remorse, revealing character through micro-choices like pouring her own memories into the coral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds with layered sensory build-up leading to a resonant reconfiguration in the pavilion, where her gift changes with felt emotional cost; orientation anchors early in the fortress courtyard, and the single-scene descent-ascent structure delivers one meaningful deepening at the coral floor touch, earning charged poise in the dawn ascent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The desert fortress after rain is vividly sensory and purposeful, with details like crunching glass-sand and bioluminescent coral constraining Marisol's choices and charging the final image of shifting tidal pools; the setting evolves causally, mirroring her internal transformation from grief to potential sweetness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of confronting stored remorse escalates through deepening emotional contagion, culminating in her agency-driven reversal that forecloses erasure for transformation with visible cost in subsuming her own memories; one meaningful textural intensification suffices, though coincidence of dream-calling slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transforming grief into something sheltering emerges organically from images like coral shifting colors and sand rearranging, offering resonant ambiguity in the final conceptual repricing of sorrow as a "secret ingredient" without moralizing; subtext in tactile memories invites reflection on emotional balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV filters perceptions through Marisol's sensory gift, with distinct rhythmic prose modulating from descriptive immersion to intense emotional peaks; no dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets, but perceptual signature shines in taste-based metaphors like "bitter almonds" and "copper pennies."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied syntax and rhythmic control, as in the opening's evocative rain imagery advancing atmosphere without loops; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, heightening peaks like the pavilion drowning sensation, with zero artifacts obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthetic gift with geological memory transforms familiar redemption tropes into a non-obvious oceanic-human grief fusion, feeling inevitable in the pavilion reversal; risk in lyric density heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
