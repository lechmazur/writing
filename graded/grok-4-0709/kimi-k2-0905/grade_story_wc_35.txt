<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marisol's motivation to sandpaper memories is clear and rooted in her curse-like gift, intensifying through embodied emotions like drowning in oceanic sorrow; her internal conflict shows contradictory impulses in the pivotal moment of reversing her gift to pour in joy, earning the change with felt cost. The single-POV interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, with her flaws complicating choices until the resonant endurance. No other characters appear, so relationship bullets are ignored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered sensory deepenings in a single continuous shard with one transition (descent/ascent), leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Marisol's gift transforms with conceptual cost legible in the final image of polished sorrow. Orientation anchors who (Marisol), where (desert fortress), and when (post-rain night to dawn) by the first paragraph. Closure lands on-page with undeniable pressure, though one more explicit causal linkage could tighten the midpoint deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The desert fortress and coral pavilion are vividly specific, with sensory details like crunching glass-sand and bioluminescent columns filtered through Marisol's taste-based POV, constraining her choices during the submersion. Environmental evolution from wet stones to shifting tidal pools mirrors internal transformation, charging the final image of humming stones. Micro-setting of the coral floor directly enables the climax, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of cleansing memories tightens through one meaningful deepening in the pavilion, where oceanic remorse forces a stance crystallization under the Accumulative lens, with felt cost in her buckling knees and reversed gift. Agency via renunciation (not erasing but transforming) forecloses forgetting, though coincidence of the dream-call slightly complicates without resolving. Moral calculus between human and land grief sharpens the peak, but one more visible price could elevate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transforming grief emerges organically from concrete images like shifting sand patterns and amber-shifting coral, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in emotionally contagious touch invites reflection on memory's balance, with emotional honesty avoiding sentimentality. The protagonist's arc inextricable from the thematic question meets the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with character-specific perceptual signature in taste-memories, modulating rhythm from descriptive breaths to compressed intensity under stress. Prose texture distinct in sensory syntax, with purposeful compression in dream references taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue present, so ignored; no head-hopping or elision issues, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the opening droplet imagery advancing atmosphere without loops or artifacts; figurative language coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the submersion. Information propulsion strong, with every line multitasking; zero scaffold or template cadence, meeting the 9+ test fully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tasting memories and oceanic remorse in a desert setting feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric accumulations heightening stakes organically. Premise transforms familiar transformation tropes through specific details like bitter almonds and coral polyps, committing fully without hedging. The non-obvious reversal of her gift recharges the core concept, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
