<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lina's motivation to transform grief into stories is clear and intensifies through embodied internal conflict, with contradictory impulses like fear and determination clashing in her rune-drawing; the closure's endurance forecloses old superstitions with felt emotional cost. Master Jomei's presence applies subtle pressure, shifting status dynamics as he nods and pours tea, revealing her hierarchy of values. Interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing, though one diagnostic label ("crystallized breath") slightly abstracts emotion mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and deepening reflection to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final rune-sealing, with conceptual cost legible in the broken quill and exhaled weight. Orientation anchors who (Lina, Master Jomei), where (floating rock platform), and when (pre-typhoon) by the first paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs as the twelfth stroke inverts superstition into release, holding the lens without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The floating rock and tea ceremony platform constrain choices, with no railing heightening terror and the kettle's plume timing the rune; sensory details like tea-dark lake and bergamot scent are selective, POV-filtered, and evolve with the storm. Atmosphere mirrors internal states subtly, as rain's saturated hush contrasts initial crystallized tension. The recurring quill and rune paper charge the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rewriting grief tightens through the rune-drawing under storm pressure, culminating in a deepening shift where the twelfth stroke releases crystallized memories with emotional cost. Agency via Lina's deliberate revisiting of superstition forecloses trapped trauma, reweighting options. Coherent accumulative pressure forces stance crystallization without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of transforming scars into stories emerges organically through rune imagery and grief motifs, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in whether revision truly rewrites loss. Subtext in silence, the kettle's plume, and Master's minimal dialogue invites reflection on memory's weight. The final image of the rock drifting higher offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting the premise without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-specific, with perceptual signature in Lina's rune-focused noticing and stress-degraded thoughts like burning lungs. Prose texture is distinct, with rhythmic syntax modulating intensity, as in short fragments during the twelfth stroke. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and subtextual, like Master's bergamot-scented exhalation and final line advancing the release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm from flowing descriptions to clipped tension in the rune strokes, avoiding loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "storm clouds stacked like bruised shelves" is coherent and purposeful, propelling momentum without muddle. No artifacts obscure closure, with strong verbs and specific details accelerating the beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical rune-craft with grief therapy transforms familiar loss tropes through specific details like the inverted superstition and quill's lightning fracture. Risk in lyric, accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry. Core premise feels inevitable, with no close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
