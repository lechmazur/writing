<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to find unused love is clear and intensifies through embodied contradictions, like the chest fracture and synchronized breathing, compelling the closure where she shifts from searching to distributing; the man's secondary pressure reveals her values via micro-choices, such as offering the bead, with visible cost in the knitting coolness. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, though the man's traits feel slightly archetypal without deeper flaws complicating his role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of breath and petals toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the orchard step-through, with conceptual cost legible in the fracture's healing and shared breath; orientation anchors early with the viaduct and pilgrim, and one meaningful deepening via the door's appearance suffices, though causality feels more poetic than strictly motivated in the camera's vanishing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The twilight viaduct in bloom is vividly sensory, with drinkable wisteria scent and foggy lucidity mirroring internal states, constraining choices like unfolding the camera on the parapet and charging the final image of the glowing viaduct; details evolve causally, such as petals clustering around the heart, making the setting indispensable to the thematic reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake of healing unused love tightens through coherent pressure in the breathing ritual, forcing stance crystallization in the door-pushing and orchard entry under the Accumulative lens, with felt cost in the chest's cool knitting; agency drives the offering and exhaling, though coincidence in the man's arrival slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocal breath preventing love's rot emerges organically from images like the jade warming and fruit apologies, offering a resonant, non-literal answer in the final distribution without moralizing; subtext in silences and gestures invites ambiguity, though the explicit realization of storage as posture borders on statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in purple-tasting breaths and ghostly blossoms, modulating rhythm under pressure; prose texture is purposeful and lyric, teaching patterned elision early, with dialogue subtextual and goal-driven in the man's lost address line, paying off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in petal drifts and breath changes, zero loops or artifacts, and metaphors like "tears salted her tongue" advancing atmosphere without muddle; high information density integrates action and image, culminating in the final transparent breath that recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The surreal synthesis of camera obscura, jade tear, and breathing door feels inevitable and fresh, transforming pilgrimage tropes through specific emotional complexity like withheld tenderness layers; bold risk in foggy lucidity heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to the premise's implications in the orchard's fruit flesh.</comment>
