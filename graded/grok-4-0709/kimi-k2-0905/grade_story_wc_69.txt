<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to unlearn hatred through subtraction is clear and intensifies via her sacrificial singing into the rosette, revealing embodied grief and contradictory impulses in her humming and listening; interiority is concrete, with emotions like rage as a "distant drone" showing specificity without therapy-speak. The meaningful endurance of silence as the city's root tone earns stasis with felt cost of her voice. Flaw: secondary characters are absent, so relationship crucibles aren't tested, but single-POV defaults hold without penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern of syllable collection and resonance building to a Conceptual Repricing where silence reweights hatred; closure lands on-page with cost (rosette crumbling, Mara's voicelessness) in the dawn scene. Orientation anchors early in the library setting. Strength: persistent rosette constraint shapes tactics from placement to singing, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The velvet library's sensory details—cedar, candle smoke, crimson drapes—vividly anchor atmosphere and constrain choices, like the rosette drinking lamplight to create silence; autumn timeframe and moonlight through stained glass charge the closure by warming the wood to sawdust. Micro-setting of the rosette as tool recurs and charges the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unlearning hatred escalates through accumulative deepening—humming, syllable braiding, sacrificial scale—under Textural lens, forcing stance crystallization with cost (voice sacrifice) legible in the transparent sound revealing rage. One meaningful intensification suffices, with agency in Mara's renunciation charging the poise. Strength: ethical calculus between sorrow and joy sharpens the peak choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of harmony through subtraction emerges organically from images like the rosette's hole and braided syllables, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in vanishing arts waiting in negative space; final image of dust circle and humming children offers resonant, non-literal repricing of enemy as a discordant note. Subtext in silence and moth-wing syllables enriches complexity without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with perceptual signature in Mara's biased noticing of frequencies and scents; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, metaphorical syntax like "velvet turned inside out," modulating with pressure without head-hopping. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; patterned elision in lyric mode taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like the flowing sentences building to quiet cadences; no loops or artifacts, high information density in multi-job lines such as books exhaling scents. Figurative language coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the scale's diminution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of musical subtraction and library ritual transforms harmony tropes through specific details like mulberry rosette and syllable braiding; risk in abstract, lyric structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the dust circle's lingering silence.</comment>
