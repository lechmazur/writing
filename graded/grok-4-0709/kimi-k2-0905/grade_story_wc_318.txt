<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied grief, as in Ellery's heart "macerating" against ribs, revealing contradictory impulses of hope and pain; motivation intensifies compellingly to the final renunciation, earning stasis with visible emotional cost; flaws like persistent mourning complicate choices without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under accumulative/textural lens, structure builds through layered echoes and memories to a resonant reconfiguration in the tunnel's laughter, with felt cost in renewed silence; orientation anchors early via the hourglass and garage; closure lands on-page with the house's exhale reweighting absence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory details in the echo-chamber tunnel constrain choices and charge the final image, as vibrations travel through stone into bones; atmosphere mirrors internal grief, evolving causally with the blower's roar; micro-setting of the blower itself guides action tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring laughter tightens through the blower's activation, deepening via the giggle's emergence, with agency in Ellery's conducting foreclosing isolation at felt emotional cost; pressure coheres accumulatively, though coincidence of the sniffle slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of tending unspoken absence emerges organically through images like the pull-cord and echoes, culminating in a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing; subtext in silences and vibrations invites reflection on grief's complexity; final image reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with distinct perceptual signature in grief-biased noticing, like the blower's "mournfully eager" handle; prose texture modulates rhythmically with emotional intensity, teaching patterned compression early; no head-hopping, and elisions pay off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety, as in layered metaphors like "concrete throat" advancing atmosphere without loops; some dense figuratives in peak beats risk muddle but cohere purposefully; propulsion strong, with final line recharging motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief with leaf-blower "symphony" and tunnel haunting feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific sensory details; risk in lyric boldness heightens stakes organically, committing to premise without gimmickry.</comment>
