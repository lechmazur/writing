<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mireille's motivation as a noticer of creeping normality is clear and intensifies through her ritual actions, rooted in consistent traits like her sensitivity to tilts; interiority is concrete via embodied sensations like tasting violet dust, with micro-choices like embedding the orris root revealing values under pressure. Emotions are embodied and contradictory, as in her sharpened motivation amid the house's loneliness. The single-POV focus excels without needing relationship bullets, earning high marks for flawed, individual perception without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images like displacements and vibrations, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final covenant with felt conceptual cost of spreading sentience; orientation anchors early with Mireille walking the bay, and one meaningful deepening occurs via the ritual's completion. Closure lands on-page with the house settling and her wondering about the city, reweighting the premise without mechanical ties. Minor elision in house mechanics is taught and pays off, avoiding causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The quiet bay in spring anchors vividly with dew-cooled cobbles and gulls, constraining choices like her dawn approach; sensory details like ironed linen air and violet dust are selective, POV-biased, and evolve causally, charging the final image of lampposts clicking off. Micro-setting of the cottage and orris root functions as environment that shapes the ritual. Tone tensions hush with blaze, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><grade>Under Textural lens, dominant stake of understanding sentient houses escalates via density increase in displacements, culminating in ritual that reweights loneliness with cost of borrowed heartbeats; one meaningful deepening narrows options, forcing her covenant choice. Agency in renunciation (not possessing) forecloses paths with felt price in her violet ghost taste. Coherent pressure crystallizes stance without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of creeping normality in sentient spaces emerges organically from images like blooming wallpaper and hovering furniture, inviting reflection on loneliness without tidy morals; subtext in silences and implications, like the house's borrowed choreography, elicits emotional aftereffect of gentle profundity. Final image of the cottage folding hands offers resonant, non-literal repricing of aliveness. No explicit statements mar the complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in selective noticing of tilts and hushes; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, patterned diction like "shard of hush," modulating with intensity. Purposeful compression and elision taught early, paid off at closure without head-hopping. No dialogue, so those bullets ignored; voice coherent and character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in poetic sentences like "wings cutting hushed blaze trails"; no loops or artifacts, with strong verbs and specific images advancing atmosphere without overwriting. Figurative language coherent and purposeful, enhancing propulsion to closure. Read-aloud flows naturally, with zero muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of perfumer's shard and sentient house feels inevitable, transforming haunted tropes through specific, non-obvious details like Morse code displacements; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth in loneliness avoids generics, with fresh inflection in the covenant ritual. Commits fully to premise, cohering as singular vision.</comment>
