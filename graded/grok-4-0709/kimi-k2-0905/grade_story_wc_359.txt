<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to certify wonder is clear and intensifies through synesthetic perceptions, revealing contradictory impulses like discarding childhood fear; interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices like ringing bells earning the final renunciation of utility. The single-POV focus allows deep exploration of flaws without stereotypes, though secondary characters are absent, which fits scope. Climax choice feels motivated by prior causality, with visible cost in heart-stripping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through sensory shards in one continuous cavern scene, with orientation anchored by first sentence; closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing as Elian swallows the sheet, reweighting wonder with felt cost of vulnerability. One meaningful deepening at the Vein tightens pressure effectively. Minor elision in aurora mechanics doesn't break lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ice cavern is vividly specific with synesthetic details like violet ripples and crimson songs, constraining choices like navigating the Echoless Vein; atmosphere of oscillating repose mirrors internal calm, charging the final clear-walled exhale. Sensory hierarchy through Elian's bias elevates it, with the environment directly enabling the slab-moving braid. Recurring ice shapes charge closure without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of retrieving the sheet to certify wonder tightens once at the Vein, deepening via aurora stripping that narrows emotional options with visible cost; agency in renunciation crystallizes stance under textural lens. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolving. Ethical calculus between wonder and utility sharpens the peak, though secondary stake is minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wonder as essential infrastructure emerges organically through images like fossilized sunrise and swallowed harmony, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in Council's outlawing; final image offers resonant non-literal repricing of awe as renewable. Subtext in silence and colors deepens complexity without confusion. Earned insight from Olesia's memory tilts stance subtly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature in synesthetic filters, like breath as golden chords; voice texture is distinct and rhythmic, modulating with pressure via purposeful compression. No dialogue, but prose reflects focalizer's mind under stress. Patterned diction teaches lyric mode early, paying off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like the pulsing calm; figurative language coheres without muddle, advancing atmosphere in every line, e.g., aurora as rope tugging the slab. Zero loops or artifacts; high information density in peak beats like the sphere entry. Opening and final lines anchor voice masterfully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of synesthesia, acoustic amber, and sculpted hush transforms fantasy tropes into a fresh angle on wonder's utility; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes organically. Emotional specificity in discarding sour fear feels inevitable. No echoes of famous scenes; bold commitment to premise without hedging.</comment>
