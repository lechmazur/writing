<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The celestial signal interpreter's motivation is clear and intensifies through her mandate to find beginnings in endings, compelling her to discard assumptions and tune the shard, with embodied emotions like tingling fingertips and tears revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. Interiority is concrete and particular, shown through micro-choices like setting the fragment on the coil, which foreclose paths with felt cost in her lighter coat and lifetime of conclusions. A strength is the hierarchy of values revealed in her rejection of assumptions, charging the closure with genuine struggle, though flaws feel slightly abstracted in peak moments without sharper irrationality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, with density increasing through layered metaphors and a cadence shift at the tuning that reweights the stake of silence as protective, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the shard dissolves, revealing lost voices with undeniable conceptual cost in reconfigured endings. Orientation anchors who (interpreter), where (Tower 7 catwalk), and when (lunar perigee) by the first sentence, waiving any penalty. Closure lands on-page with the final image of descending stairs as a hinge to new beginnings, shaped by persistent constraints like the gorge and moon-pull.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The abandoned radio tower city over a gorge is vividly specific, with sensory details like rusted iron ringing and girders creaking under lunar gravity constraining choices, such as climbing into the transmitter room, and charging the final image of the balanced city as a bridge of absence. Atmosphere builds through purposeful selectivity, mirroring internal vacancy with dust motes and bloated moon, evolving causally as the gorge widens to birth new voices. A key moment is the tower stopping its sway, where setting directly reconfigures the closure with tactile, lived-in navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of tuning the shard before it silences transmissions escalates through accumulative deepening, with a meaningful tightening when discarding assumptions narrows options, forcing a trade-off that reweights silence as a cocoon with felt cost in tears and sublimated gold. Protagonist agency drives the intensification via her adjustments and realizations, crystallizing stance in the final Charged Poise of smiling with mercury eyes. The conceptual cost is unmistakable in the reconfiguration of every ending as a loop, though coincidence of the shard's nature slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence as protective and endings as beginnings emerges organically from images like the shard as cocoon and tape loops, inviting reflection through ambiguity in the interpreter's realization without tidy morals. Subtext in gestures like open palms and the dissolving shard offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the premise with complexity. The final image of the gorge pregnant with voices elicits emotional aftereffect through particulars, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward cosmic metaphors like antennas humming grammar, and prose texture distinct in rhythmic, patterned diction that teaches lyric compression early. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; psychic distance shifts intentionally with emotional intensity, like tingling constellations under stress. Elision of direct conflict pays off at closure without head-hopping, maintaining focalization control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, every sentence advancing atmosphere and theme through vivid images like dust motes in slow-motion waltzes, varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, accelerating momentum in peak beats like the silence expanding as snowfall, with zero artifacts obscuring closure. The opening anchors voice immediately, and the final line resolves by recharging motifs with the click of akeyboard, no overwriting issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of sci-fi elements with lyric fantasy, transforming tropes of lost signals into a non-obvious angle on silence as cocoon, feeling inevitable through specific details like the hollywood star fragment's arrogance. Risk-taking in dense, metaphorical structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, committing to the premise's implications in the final reconfiguration. A standout moment is the shard sliding like a cat to a hearth, a memorable inflection growing from prior particulars.</comment>
