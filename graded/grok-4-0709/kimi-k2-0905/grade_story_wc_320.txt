<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The celestial signal interpreter's motivation to find beginnings in endings is clear and intensifies through her actions, like discarding assumptions, revealing internal conflict via embodied metaphors such as tingling fingertips and tears; however, interiority leans abstract with stock epiphanies in the climax, like realizing the shard as a cocoon, slightly undercutting contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and realizations with a resonant reconfiguration at the end, where the shard dissolves into a conceptual repricing of silence as a seed, carrying felt cost in her lightened coat and lifetime of conclusions; orientation anchors early with the catwalk and tower, and one meaningful deepening suffices for this length without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned radio tower city over the gorge is vividly specific, constraining choices like climbing into the transmitter room, and charges the final image as a balanced bridge of absence; lunar perigee affects atmosphere and pressure, with sensory details filtered through her urgency, such as creaking girders and dust motes in moonlight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of tuning the shard before it silences transmissions escalates texturally through discarding assumptions and adjusting the dial, culminating in a deepening that reweights options with conceptual cost in the blooming broadcasts; agency via her renunciation of assumptions forecloses paths, though pressure feels more poetic than visceral, with one meaningful cadence shift sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of silence as a protective cocoon for lost voices emerges organically from images like the shard eating transmissions and blooming broadcasts, inviting reflection on endings as hinges without tidy morals; the final image of the gorge pregnant with voices offers a resonant, non-literal repricing, though some overt statements like "every quiet is merely rehearsal" border on assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, selective noticing, like antennas humming like crickets that learned grammar; prose texture modulates rhythmically with pressure, using purposeful compression and non-standard phrasing that's voice-motivated and legible, paying off in the closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, high information density in metaphors like the shard sliding like a cat to a hearth, and zero loops or scaffolds; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, accelerating in peak beats like tuning the coil without muddle, though some stacked similes in the transmitter room approach overwriting without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sci-fi elements with poetic fantasy, transforming tropes like lost signals into a fresh angle on silence as a seed, with risk-taking in lyric structure heightening stakes through inevitable realizations; the core premise feels singular, with memorable details like the Hollywood star fragment sublimating into photon, avoiding derivatives.</comment>
