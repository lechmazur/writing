<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The summoner's motivation to map silence and hush the prophecy is clear and intensifies through embodied actions like swallowing the sphere, revealing internal contradictions in his solitary endurance with a felt cost of carrying the weight. Interiority is concrete, with emotions embodied in heart-heat and copper taste, avoiding stock phrasing. The meaningful change is earned by prior causality, culminating in the cracked smile that stays, foreclosing isolation with visible emotional curvature.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images like cranes multiplying and folding into a sphere, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the summoner swallows the prophecy with a felt cost of internal rotation, reweighting his cosmic grounding. Orientation anchors who (summoner), where (brook), and when (nocturnal) by the first 120 words. Closure lands on-page with the final smile and crane release, charging the hush as mastery of blaze.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven beside the quiet brook is vividly sensory, with moonlight glazing ripples and cold gripping ankles, constraining choices like stepping into the water to lift the cranes. Details filter through POV bias, mirroring internal hush via reeds and wind whispers. The micro-setting of the brook evolves causally, polishing prophecy into pebbles, charging the final image of downstream flow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of hushing the prophecy escalates through density increase in crane murmuration and drumbeat opposition, culminating in a deepening that reweights tranquility as mastery with the cost of internal burden. One meaningful tightening occurs when the summoner speaks the inverse word, narrowing options and forcing endurance. Agency in swallowing the sphere crystallizes stance with visible price in the rotating sphere against bone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of tranquility as mastery of blaze emerges organically from images like the sphere's rotation and final crane release, inviting reflection on carrying quiet without direct moralizing. Subtext in silences and pauses builds resonance, with the ending image offering a non-literal answer by reweighting prophecy as harmless pebbles. Emotional aftereffect lingers through the summoner's cracked smile, embracing complexity in his private galaxy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with perceptual signature in cosmic-terrestrial biases like roots and nebulae in ripples. Prose texture is distinct, with rhythmic syntax modulating in hushed pauses and builds, teaching patterned elision in silence mapping. No dialogue, so policy skips; final image maintains coherence under textural lens without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, each sentence advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "tasted copper—code bleeding through the air," varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats like swallowing the sphere. Information propulsion accelerates in the climax, with zero artifacts dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes origami, silence mapping, and cosmic hush into a fresh angle on prophecy, feeling inevitable through evolving crane motifs that heighten stakes. Risk in lyric abstraction pays off without gimmickry, transforming tropes like swallowed burdens into idiosyncratic mastery of blaze. Emotional specificity in the staying smile avoids generics, committing to the vision.</comment>
