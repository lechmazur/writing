<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The seer's motivation to reclaim buried talents is clear and rooted in grief-driven traits, intensifying through embodied emotions like throat thickness and skin revelations; internal conflict shows contradictory impulses in her nightly substitutions versus the stone's refusal, culminating in an earned renunciation of her mercury-glass armor with felt cost. Strengths include character-specific blind spots, like trading belonging for safety, that compound into the climax. A minor slip is the somewhat stock "war took everything" backstory, but it anchors without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through reflective shards to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the feather writes truth, cracking the mercury glass and unfurling talents with conceptual cost of painful remembering; orientation anchors early in the bookstore's caverns, and one meaningful deepening occurs via the stone-feather convergence. The ending lands on-page with Charged Poise in the final words about home, reweighting prior grief. Minor orientation waiver applies as deliberate mythic disorientation pays off at closure, avoiding penalties.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like copper-tasting air and thrumming heartbeat constraining choices and charging the final image where corridors rearrange into lost homes; micro-setting of the feather pedestal and mountain bones mirrors internal states through action. Specificity in shelves like "Cartography of Dreams" filters through POV bias, evolving causally as the space reshapes. This environment directly shapes the climax, meeting the 9+ test by charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming buried talents signals early and tightens once through the feather's writing, forcing a stance crystallization under the Textural lens with felt cost in fracturing substitutes; agency via renunciation forecloses isolation, with moral calculus between safety and necessity. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolving it. The single deepening is sufficient, but lacks a second optional accent for higher escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of home as necessity emerges organically from images like the crumbling stone and cracking glass, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final words that reweights belonging without moralizing; subtext in whispers and thunder invites reflection on grief's complexity. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars like childhood house-speaking, avoiding abstraction. It meets the 9+ test but caps below due to slight thematic echo in the explicit "Home is not where you are safe—it is where you are necessary."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in mirrored palms and humming stone, modulating rhythm under pressure like thunderous buildup; brief dialogue feels natural and subtextual, advancing via the old man's non-question. Patterned elision in mythic phrasing is taught early and pays off at closure. Meets 9+ test with rhythmic control and no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in storm-like sentences and avoiding loops; metaphors like silver flakes as snow are coherent and propel momentum without muddle in peak beats. Minor scaffold in one paraphrase loop ("real enough to kill or cure") but no clarity harm at closure. Meets 9+ test with zero artifacts touching the ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing phoenix feather with mercury-glass skin for a fresh angle on buried talents, feeling inevitable through the bookstore's home-like reshaping; risk in lyric mosaic heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transforms fantasy tropes via specific emotional truth in grief's cost. Minor derivative echo of mythic quests, but committed vision elevates it.</comment>
