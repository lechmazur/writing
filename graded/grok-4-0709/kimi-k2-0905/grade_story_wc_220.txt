<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bloodhound Scraps shows strong motivation rooted in her past as a tracker, with intuitive descriptive traits driving micro-choices like translating scents into syntax, culminating in an earned endurance that forecloses her retirement with felt cost. Kite's internal conflict is embodied through trembling fingers and understanding the riddle, revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. The relationship between Scraps and Kite acts as a crucible, forcing choices that alter their bond by the end. Minor weakness in the brother's flat emergence, but it doesn't undermine pivotal motivations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elisions and scent motifs toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where distance kneels, with conceptual cost legible in the wasteland's humming transformation. Orientation anchors who (Scraps, Kite), where (scrapyard, wasteland), and when (post-war) by ~100 words, waiving any penalty. One meaningful deepening occurs via the cylinder-riddle interaction, fitting scope with coherent transitions across shards. Strength in the final image reweighting separation as readable grooves, though ellipsis in digging the brother feels slightly soft.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cracked wasteland and scrapyard settlement are vividly specific, with sensory details like rusted drones and orchard smoke filtered through Scraps' nose, constraining choices like scent-tracking. Atmosphere builds a wild hush that mirrors internal hush, evolving causally with events like blooming tanks. The preserved leaf as a recurring object charges the final image, constraining the riddle's resolution. Exceptional integration where environment pressures the journey and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding the brother signals early via the cylinder, tightening once through the riddle's deepening that narrows options via scent coordinates, under Accumulative lens. Pressure coheres via intuitive tugs and scent layers, forcing stance crystallization at the subway car with felt cost in digging and limping. Agency in Scraps' bark and Kite's pressing of the leaf earns the resolution without coincidence resolving it. Minor slip in low external opposition, but internal deepening carries the escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of translating distance into closeness emerges organically from scent motifs and the leaf's revelations, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the riddle's complexity. Subtext in silences and images like the wax softening invites reflection on separation's costs. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by repricing the wasteland's hush. Strength in emotional honesty avoiding sentimentality, though one overt statement in the closing line borders on moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays stable with perceptual signature biased toward Scraps' scents and Kite's observations, modulating rhythm with emotional intensity like stuttering player. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax and rhythm, teaching patterned diction early for legibility. Dialogue is sparse but natural, subtextual, and advances plot, like the brother's riddle line. No head-hopping, with purposeful compression in journey shards paying off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally and avoiding loops, though some metaphors like "spilled blood that had decided to become a sunrise" border on muddle without harming clarity. Sentences propel via strong verbs and specific images, with no artifacts in peak beats like the riddle unfolding. Opening anchors voice, final line resolves by recharging motifs. Minor overwriting in descriptive stacks, but momentum holds through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic tracking with poetic scent-riddles feels inevitable, transforming tropes like lost siblings through specific motifs like wax-preserved leaves. Risk-taking in anthropomorphic hound POV heightens stakes without gimmickry, cohering as singular vision. Fresh inflection in repricing distance via phonograph grooves avoids derivatives. Proximity check clear, with authenticity elevating the band.</comment>
