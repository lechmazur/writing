<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Scraps's motivation evolves from retired tracker to intuitive guide, rooted in scent-based traits that compel choices like nudging the leaf, with embodied contradictions in her limp and tug toward finding the living; Kite's drive feels consistent but secondary, with relationships pressuring decisions at the cylinder moment; flaws like abstract interiority slightly dilute specificity, but the hierarchy of values shines in the climax bark that reveals coordinates.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through scent and riddle shards with legible transitions, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where finding the brother reprices separation as a groove to read, with felt cost in Scraps's limp and the wasteland's hush; orientation anchors early via the scrapyard and hound; one meaningful deepening at the cylinder kiss tightens to closure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The cracked wasteland and scrapyard constrain choices, like digging the subway car, with sensory details filtered through Scraps's nose (copper, iron, ozone) mirroring internal longing; the preserved leaf as micro-setting charges the final image of orchard smoke, evolving causally from relic to talisman; tone tensions wild hush with revelations, heightening atmosphere without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><grade>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of translating distance into closeness tightens through the riddle's deepening at the cylinder, forcing stance crystallization with visible cost in bare-handed digging and Scraps's limp; agency via intuitive actions like pressing the leaf drives escalation without coincidence resolving; one meaningful cadence shift reweights options at the brother's emergence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of preserved closeness amid ruin emerges organically from leaf and riddle motifs, reweighting separation through the final non-literal image of wind as orchard smoke, inviting ambiguity without confusion; subtext in silences and scents elicits emotional aftereffect of hope's cost; avoids moralizing, with the brother's words repricing the premise subtly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person focalization through Scraps and Kite stays stable with perceptual signature in scent-syntax translation, no head-hopping; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, patterned diction like "wild hush" that teaches lyric compression early and pays off at closure; dialogue sparse but subtextual, advancing via riddle; rhythmic control heightens under pressure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose propels with high density, varying syntax and rhythm in phrases like "distance preserved yet closeness promised" that advance atmosphere and character; zero loops or scaffolds, clean grammar, and purposeful fragments enhance momentum; figurative language coherent without muddle, charging closure with "groove waiting for the right nose."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of anthropomorphic hound and riddle-cylinder in post-war scrapyard transforms familiar lost-family trope through scent-as-syntax ingenuity, feeling inevitable at the leaf's softening; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; avoids derivatives, committing to premise with authentic vision.</comment>
