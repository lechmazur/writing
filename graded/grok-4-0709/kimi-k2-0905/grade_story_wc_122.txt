<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to overcome grief-driven numbness is clear and intensifies through embodied choices like repairing the needle and crafting the drum, revealing contradictory impulses in her silent world; Temen's secondary pressure heightens her internal conflict effectively. Interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions layered contradictorily without therapy-speak. The final renunciation of numbness feels earned, foreclosing emotional isolation with visible cost in raw pain. Voice distinction shines in Mara's perceptual bias toward vibrations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increasing through sensory buildup to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final drumbeat, reweighting grief with felt cost; orientation anchors who (Mara, Temen), where (cavern), and when (turning seasons) by line 3. Single continuous scene fits defaults with one meaningful deepening via the backward lullaby. Closure lands on-page with undeniable emotional repricing; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The drum maker's cavern is vividly anchored with sensory details like cedar dust and frost, filtered through Mara's tactile bias; it constrains choices by providing tools and echoes that charge the final image at the cavern mouth. Atmosphere mirrors her muted grief, evolving causally with vibrations. Micro-setting of the phonograph and drum directly shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of defeating numbness signals early and deepens texturally through the repair and drum-making, crystallizing in a charged poise with felt cost of raw pain; one meaningful intensification via merged vibrations narrows emotional options. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving. Agency in endurance forecloses numbness with legible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of reversing silence into resonant grief emerges organically from images like the backward lullaby and filament, inviting reflection on loss without moralizing; subtext in gestures and vibrations adds complexity. Final image offers non-literal repricing of numbness as "silence waiting to be spun backward." Emotional aftereffect lingers through honest ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with Mara's tactile perceptual signature, modulating rhythm under emotional pressure; signed dialogue feels natural and advances subtext without tags. Prose texture is distinct, with purposeful lyric compression taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally; metaphors like "filament of hush" cohere without muddle, propelling momentum. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; final line recharges motifs effectively. Information advances atmosphere and character seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deafness, grief, and reversed sound transforms familiar loss tropes through specific cavern tactics and vibrational motifs; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional complexity feels inevitable, avoiding generics. Bold perceptual angle coheres as singular vision.</comment>
