<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to overcome emotional numbness is clear and intensifies through concrete actions like repairing the needle, revealing contradictory impulses in her grief; interiority is embodied in vibrations felt through bones, with flaws like persistent numbness complicating choices. Temen's presence applies relevant pressure, forcing shared motion that alters their dynamic. The meaningful endurance earns closure by foreclosing numbness with felt cost in raw pain. Voice distinction shines in signed communication and perceptual specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increasing through sensory buildup to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final drumbeat, reweighting grief with undeniable emotional cost; orientation anchors early in the cavern with Mara and Temen. One continuous scene fits defaults, with motivated ellipsis in memory unwinding. Closure lands on-page with the needle as persistent constraint shaping tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cavern setting is vivid and purposeful, with cedar dust and frost constraining choices like the pedal lathe use; sensory details like vibrating floorboards reflect Mara's POV bias and urgency, mirroring internal hush. Micro-setting of the phonograph and drum charges the final image with snowflakes. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, evolving causally with actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of defeating numbness signals early and deepens through the backward melody peeling numbness, forcing stance crystallization under textural lens; one meaningful deepening suffices, with visible cost in raw grief. Agency in repairing and feeling vibrations forecloses numbness path. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reversing silence into resonant grief emerges organically from images like the backward lullaby and drumhead, inviting reflection through ambiguity in felt seasons; final image offers non-literal answer reweighting numbness as waiting song without moralizing. Subtext in gestures and vibrations enriches complexity. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality via concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in vibration-focused noticing biased by deafness; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, sensory diction modulating with intensity. Signed "dialogue" feels natural, advancing plot via subtext in nods and taps. No head-hopping; elision in memory payoff teaches pattern legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like "the cavern seemed to inhale; even the cedar dust paused mid-air" propelling momentum; no loops or artifacts, metaphors coherent without muddle. Information advances atmosphere and character; final line recharges filament motif effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deafness, backward music, and drum-making transforms grief tropes through specific sensory reversals; non-obvious angle in feeling sound backward heightens stakes organically. Bold lyric structure risks heighten meaning without gimmickry. Authenticity coheres in singular vision.</comment>
