<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to understand story magnetization is clear and intensifies through embodied emotions like the borrowed heart's acceleration, revealing contradictory impulses in moments like lunging for the wing. Interiority is concrete, with flaws like vertigo of memory complicating choices, leading to an earned stasis in accepting the donor's legacy. The single-POV focus excels without needing secondary characters, though minor stock phrasing in emotional summaries slightly flattens peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through motif accrual like sun trails and runes, with orientation anchored by the first paragraph in the tea house. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing via Kael's realization about story hollows, with felt cost in the heart's surging pulse and narrative saturation. One meaningful deepening suffices, though the abrupt cutoff mid-sentence risks minor lens ambiguity at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house and valley-mist setting are vivid and purposeful, constraining choices like climbing to the roof for sunrise runes and pressuring the bridge lunge. Sensory details, biased through Kael's dye-master perception, evolve causally with mist applause and grinding sky-isles, charging the final image of mica stars. Environment directly shapes the closure by dislodging the pebble, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of integrating the donor's essence tightens through textural density increases, like the wing's flutter revealing a vision that forces emotional cost in stumbling pulse. Agency via micro-choices like holding the wing aloft forecloses paths with visible price, though coincidence in the pebble fall complicates without resolving. Escalation drives to stance crystallization under the lens, with cost unmistakable in the heart's rhythm shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of magnetizing stories emerges organically from images like the wing drinking voices, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in silences and implications, like iridescent caution, invites reflection on visibility and legacy. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through complex tenderness-terror blend, though one overt statement in the realization slightly risks abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in color-shifting details and rhythmic prose modulating with pressure, like trembling ribbons. Brief dialogue from the proprietor feels natural and subtextual, advancing the quest. Patterned diction teaches lyric compression early, paying off at closure without head-hopping, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose density is high with multi-job sentences and varied rhythm, like steam curling like pale silk advancing atmosphere and momentum. Figurative language is coherent without muddle, though occasional stacked metaphors in peak beats risk minor overwriting. Zero loops or artifacts, with strong propulsion to the glowing wing's closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fantasy elements like sun trails and story-magnetizing hearts feels inevitable, transforming quest tropes through specific dye-master worldview and bold risks in textural structure. Non-obvious angle on legacy heightens stakes without gimmickry, with the wing's narrative saturation recharging motifs. Risk-taking elevates coherence, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
