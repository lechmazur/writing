<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ghost's motivation to seek applause for memory cohesion is clear and intensifies through synesthetic interiority, with embodied emotions like tasting iron or feeling frost; internal conflict shows in his confession to Lila, revealing contradictory longing for past and present. Lila's presence as a crucible forces choices that alter their spectral relationship. Strengths include character-specific perceptions degrading under existential stress, with flaws like eternal despair complicating his renunciation of isolation. The hierarchy of values shines in tying the thread to the quince tree, foreclosing oblivion with felt nostalgic cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increases via layered echoes and sensory ribbons building to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure, where the timeline seals into a continuous present with conceptual cost of perpetual performance. Orientation anchors who (ghost), where (theater to maze/orchard), and when (post-closing night) by ~50 words. Structure fits Track A defaults with one continuous shard-like sequence and one meaningful deepening at the coin flip. The final image of carrying an endless encore reweights options with undeniable pressure, shaped by persistent synesthetic constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mystic orchard garden constrains choices, supplying resources like the quince tree for threading that charge the final image of blooming backward; sensory details are vivid and purposeful, with night-blooming nicotia releasing violin-like perfumes reflecting the ghost's urgency. Micro-setting of the stage and hedges guides action through tactile navigation. Tone tensions regret with nostalgic brightness, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from alley to orchard, evolving causally with the maze rearranging itself.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of luring possibility from despair signals early and tightens once through the threaded coin's echoes layering into a heartbeat, narrowing options to a crystallized stance under Accumulative lens; agency via endurance forecloses isolation with visible cost in Lila's flickering departure. Pressure coheres via sensory intensification, forcing stance crystallization without coincidence resolving. Moral calculus between craving and acceptance sharpens the peak at lifting the coin together. The quince blooming backward tests commitment, altering tactics with nostalgic thickening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of time as a rememberable song emerges organically from images like fractured ribbons and threaded echoes, inviting reflection on memory's fragility without tidy morals; subtext in Lila's baton-like thimble implies conducting possibility amid despair. Emotional aftereffect arises from the applause-rainfall bow, eliciting honest nostalgia over sentimentality. Dramatic irony in the ghost's sharpened outline reweights the premise with conceptual cost. The final image of the dimming orchard offers a resonant, non-literal answer to longing's brink.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person limited is stable, with perceptual signature in synesthetic biases like tasting starlight or seeing gold spirals; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, sensory diction that modulates with intensity. Dialogue in Lila's lilting question carries subtext and advances plot via advice on luring possibility. Purposeful compression in timeline folding teaches pattern early, paying off at closure without head-hopping. Syntax reflects the ghost's fractured state, with non-standard punctuation in echoes enhancing legibility under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose propels with high density, varying rhythm in sensory cascades like "citrine applause, indigo silence, rose regret" advancing atmosphere without loops; clarity shines in concise, multi-job sentences free of scaffold or redundancy. Figurative language coheres without muddle, as in threads weaving a curtain of years. No artifacts obscure closure, with strong verbs and specific nouns dominating. The final line resolves by recharging the ghost-light motif with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthetic tarot and timeline weaving transforms ghost tropes through specific sensory details like humming forbidden flavors, feeling inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in lyric accumulations heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on spectral longing via mourners' collective memory creating the orchard. Emotional specificity avoids generics, with authenticity in the thimble's spin. Bold structural compression commits to implications, elevating coherence.</comment>
