<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to evolve tradition is clear and intensifies through her caution versus conspiracy rush, with embodied interiority via plant whispers; the pledge moment reveals her value hierarchy with felt cost. Strengths include contradictory impulses in the cave, earning the final renunciation of thrones. Minor slip in stock grandmotherly caution phrasing, but it doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages from kite discovery to unsealing; closure is a Decisive Change with Resonant Reconfiguration, cost legible in the pledge echoing through roots. Orientation anchors early in the caldera. Strength in motivated ellipsis at the cave mouth, shaping tactics without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Volcanic hot springs are vivid and purposeful, constraining choices like raft-weaving and cooling ferns; the sinter cave charges the final image by enabling the unsealing. Sensory details filtered through Liora's bias, evolving causally with steam and heat. Environment directly shapes the climax, meeting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of evolving tradition tightens causally from kite decoding to cocoon wrapping, with agency in Liora's pledge foreclosing thrones; cost is felt in marrow vibrations and responsibility. One meaningful deepening at the seal suffices, driven by protagonist choice. Minor abstraction in stakes early, but escalation lands under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of intentional evolution emerges organically from plant telepathy and the child's first thought, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final image of growing leaves. Subtext in moss suggestions and root echoes enriches complexity without moralizing. Ending reweights prior insurgency with ambiguity, meeting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in plant whispers and steam comet; rhythmic control heightens pressure in cave beats without elision issues. No dialogue, so policy skips; prose texture purposeful and lyric, taught early. Minor filter verb in "she sensed," but consistent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense with propulsion, varying rhythm in steam paddling and cocoon cracking; no loops or artifacts obscure closure. Figurative language like "comet's tail" integrates without muddle, doing double duty. Minor synonym churn in "whispers of insurgency," but doesn't touch peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of plant telepathy and grafted embryo transforms insurgency trope into eco-rebellion; risk in lyric causality heightens stakes without gimmickry. Child's thought "teach me how to rebel kindly" feels inevitable, recharging premise. Fresh angle on tradition evolves organically, meeting 9+ test.</comment>
