<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maris's motivation is clear and rooted in her grandfather's riddle, intensifying to compel her cathedral visit and mural creation; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like tears of continuation charging the closure. Internal conflict shows through her quiet drive clashing with emotional inheritance, revealed in micro-choices like accepting the key and mixing paints. The final renunciation of sorrow for peace forecloses isolation with felt cost, earning the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, motifs of hush, light, and blooming build density to a resonant reconfiguration in the mural's awakening, with conceptual cost in inherited curiosity reweighted as communion. Orientation anchors early in the pavilion, serving the lyric pattern without disorientation. Closure lands on-page via the final image of sprouting questions, charging prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cathedral's hidden etched glass constrains Maris's discovery, directly charging the final mural image by providing the cipher that reweights her understanding. Sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, with autumn pavilion and nocturnal gardens mirroring internal states through action. Environment evolves causally, from pavilion shade to chamber prisms, guiding choices without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reckoning with the riddle tightens under time pressure from melting snow, deepening via cathedral discovery that narrows options and changes knowledge, consistent with textural lens. Agency in painting the mural crystallizes stance with visible cost in emotional continuation. One meaningful deepening suffices, but lacks a sharper trade-off for higher band entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of nocturnal blooming as communion emerges organically from postcards, glass etchings, and mural, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in inherited curiosity. Subtext in silences and images like yawning petals invites reflection, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer that reweights the premise. Epiphany earned through dramatized struggle, avoiding platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with distinct perceptual signature in color and hush motifs biased by Maris's artist worldview. Prose texture is purposeful and rhythmic, modulating with intensity; brief dialogue feels natural and subtextual, like Brother Ellion's murmur advancing the key moment. No head-hopping or register mismatch, with patterned diction taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and high information density in metaphors like "ice dripped like slow clocks" advancing atmosphere without loops. Some figurative stacking in peak beats risks muddle, but clarity holds at closure; no artifacts obscure cause-effect. Strong verbs and specific nouns dominate, with clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mural art, ancestral riddles, and cathedral secrets feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific etched-glass mechanics and phosphorescent paints. Risk in lyric structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on curiosity's inheritance, cohering as singular vision.</comment>
