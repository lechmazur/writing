<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marrow's moral ambiguity drives her actions, creating contradictory impulses in Ithica's perception of her as saint or swindler, which layers his grief with uncertainty; Ithica's motivation to hide sorrow under the mandate is embodied in his painted smile and panic at inspectors, leading to an earned endurance with felt cost in the remade hush. Strengths include concrete interiority through his heartbeat matching her hands, but secondary character pressure feels slightly stock without deeper status shifts. The final choice to accept the lamp's light forecloses open sorrow, charged by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned narration and imagery to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the remade hush, with conceptual cost of acknowledging grief's weight; orientation anchors early with the farmhouse and turbines. Closure lands on-page with the hush becoming space for grief to float, reweighting the emotional void. Minor slip in ellipsis between supper and whittling, but it holds without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The farmhouse and turbines constrain choices, casting perpetual shadow that mirrors Ithica's grief and pressures his compliance; sensory details like rain tapping and blades groaning evolve causally, charging the final image of the hush amid restarting turbines. Micro-setting of the hearth and lamp integrates action, with weather affecting the inspectors' arrival. Environment charges the closure by funneling invisible light against the mandate's shadow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of cultivating lightness in grief escalates through Accumulative/Textural density in narration and whittling, tightening to the lamp's glow that forces stance crystallization against inspectors; one meaningful deepening occurs when the lamp projects halos, narrowing options with the cost of potential fines legible in Ithica's panic. Agency in Marrow's blowing and Ithica's acceptance forecloses open sorrow. Coincidence of sirens complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of lightness within grief's weight emerges through images like the bouquet and lamp, resisting tidy morals by embracing ambiguity in Marrow's role; subtext in silence and narration invites reflection on mandated happiness. Final image of the remade hush offers resonant, non-literal repricing of emotional voids. Earned through particulars like the cedar channels funneling light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV stays stable, with perceptual signature in poetic filtering like clouds as obedient ribbons; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, metaphorical prose that modulates with pressure, teaching patterned elision early. Dialogue is subtextual, like Marrow's intonations pursuing comfort through indirection. No head-hopping, and elision in transitions pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in metaphors like blades slicing clouds; no major loops or artifacts, though some figurative density in narration borders overwriting without muddling clarity. Propulsion advances through images, with strong verbs and specific details like cedar curls. Final line resolves by recharging the hush motif cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dystopian mandate with a blank-faced performer whittling grief into light feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific moral ambiguity and turbine-shadowed setting; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in the lamp's glow avoids generics. Core premise commits fully, with non-obvious angle on forced happiness.</comment>
