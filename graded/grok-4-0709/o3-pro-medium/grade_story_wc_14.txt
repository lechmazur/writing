<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Calix's motivation as a time-smith is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in studious traits that drive high-stakes choices like speaking the town's doom, with embodied emotions like staggering under sorrow showing contradictory impulses in scene. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, as seen in his heartbeat sounding like distant shovels, which reveals values under pressure. The single-POV scope fits, with endurance earning a felt cost of absorbed grief, though the lack of a second character limits relational crucibles. Overall strong, but minor safety-hedging in his flawless restraint slightly tempers the flaw-driven mistakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through patterned images of silence and refraction, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where history becomes a loom with the cost of future sorrow undeniably felt in the final hiding of the notepad. Orientation anchors early with the mountain mist and Calix's desk, teaching the poetic pattern without disorientation. Causality holds via textural linkages, with the hum's mapping escalating to a resonant reconfiguration, though one micro-turn (prism pulsing hungrily) feels slightly under-motivated by prior beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The blooming bonsai labyrinth on the mountaintop is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like cedar scents and splitting trunks constraining choices and charging the closure as seasons pirouette and petals scatter like torn ledgers. Atmosphere supports the theme through mist and hush, mirroring Calix's restraint, and the micro-setting of the desk and antennae evolves causally, pressuring the time-refraction. A recurring object (bonsai) charges the final image of trembling leaves with unspoken stories, meeting the 9+ test exceptionally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of collecting time textures signals early and deepens once through the prism's hunger, forcing Calix to confront future grief with a felt cost of staggering absorption, consistent with Accumulative/Textural escalation via cadence shift. Pressure coheres, narrowing options as the lamp brightens and bonsai split, crystallizing his archival stance. Agency in renunciation (not avoiding the avalanche) forecloses paths with legible cost, though coincidence of the hum's timing slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of time as textured loom emerges organically from images like the chronal prism and gathered threads, with subtext in silences and bonsai changes inviting reflection on courage amid sorrow. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—history bottled beside vows—reweighting the premise without moralizing, meeting the 9+ test. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through honest complexity, though one abstract statement ("history was not a river but a loom") borders on directness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward auditory textures like the filament's prayer, and rhythmic control in flowing syntax heightens pressure without obscurity. Purposeful compression in lyric descriptions teaches patterns early, paying off at closure with legible reconfiguration. No dialogue, so policy applies; elision of town details serves voice modesty, avoiding unwarranted certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in sentences like "lines intersected, parted, recollected" advancing atmosphere and character without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, though heavy in peak beats like the prism unfolding risks minor overwriting without muddle. High information density shines in multi-job lines, such as the lamp's buzz as "filament's prayer," and zero artifacts in closure secure the score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise of auricular alchemy via lamp hum transforms familiar time-travel tropes into a fresh synthesis of stationer as time-smith, feeling inevitable with risk-taking in poetic refraction that heightens stakes organically. Originality in details like copper antennae grazing moss and bonsai as time witnesses avoids echoes, committing to the vision without hedging. The non-obvious angle on archival courage, with bold lyric structure, elevates coherence and meets the 9+ test.</comment>
