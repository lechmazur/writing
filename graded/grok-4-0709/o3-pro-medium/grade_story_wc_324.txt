<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to protect vulnerable voices is clear and intensifies through persistent curiosity, driving higher-stakes choices like descending into darkness; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses of fear and curiosity acting simultaneously, as when she halts with tight lungs but whispers her promise. The reflection on incidental heroism feels slightly summary-like, bordering on unearned epiphany, but it tilts her final stance without derailing causality. No second character, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant. Overall strong, with the hierarchy of values revealed in her micro-choice to synchronize the aid despite the boy's impossible giggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure follows clear because/therefore linkages from the whispering call to investigation, pulse-tracking, discovery, and revival, with one meaningful tightening as pulses crescendo into coordinates; orientation anchors who (Mira), where (atrium), and when (twilight) within the first sentence, serving closure. Closure is a Decisive Change with Resonant Reconfiguration as she revives the voices, transforming the hush with felt conceptual cost in remembrance and the boy's archived pulse. Persistent constraint of the hearing aid shapes tactics throughout. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is vividly specific, with sensory details like seeping mist, cracked glass, and wet stone filtered through Mira's urgency, narrowing perception during crisis; the environment constrains choices, as the chained door and slick ladders pressure her descent, and charges the final image as mist vibrates with revived sounds. Tone tensions the eerie hush intentionally, mirroring her nerves. Micro-setting of the fountain and vault evolves causally, guiding action without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of protecting vulnerable voices signals early and tightens once through the quickening pulses forcing descent and entry, narrowing options under Causal lens pressure; agency drives escalation via her adjustments and synchronization, with visible cost as she bleeds lantern power, foreclosing isolation but crystallizing stance. Coincidence of the call complicates without resolving. Moral calculus between curiosity and fear sharpens the peak, but the cost feels more conceptual than viscerally layered, limiting to strong rather than exceptional.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of incidental heroism and remembering the unheard emerges organically from Mira's actions and the bioacoustics discovery, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the boy's non-rescue call; subtext in images like the torn airplane and preserved seeds reweights remembrance without direct statement. The final image of vibrating mist and vigilant hush offers a resonant, non-literal answer to protecting voices, eliciting emotional aftereffect through complexity. Internal arc inextricable from thematic question of hearing the dead.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward auditory details like ticks and giggles, modulating rhythm under stress without register drift; prose texture distinct in poetic syntax and purposeful compression, teaching patterns like reeling hush early for legibility at closure. No dialogue, so those bullets ignored. No head-hopping or elision issues; psychic distance shifts intentionally serve emotional beats like the shy giggle.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, each sentence advancing atmosphere or action, as in the rhythmic ticks resolving from static; syntactic variety supports propulsion, varying rhythms from hushed thuds to cascading laughter without loops or scaffold. No artifacts like synonym churn or filter-verb stacks; final line recharges motifs with vigilant hush. Exceptional control, with purposeful non-standard phrasing like "twang along her nerves" heightening without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of contact tracing with heart echoes and bioacoustics offers fresh angle on remembrance, transforming ghost story tropes through specific details like seed-linked speakers; risk-taking in lyric hush motif heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry. Core premise commits fully, with emotional specificity avoiding generics. Bold conceptual integrity in the non-rescue call elevates coherence.</comment>
