<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's watchful dreamer traits drive consistent, quietly proactive motivations that intensify toward grafting meaning, with embodied interiority in tracing condensation and mapping dots; Rowan's secondary pressure forces her micro-choices, like proffering the pendant, revealing value hierarchies with felt cost in his tears; the pendant exchange exemplifies contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, earning the stasis of shared roots.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of moss, amber, and hush toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final sleeping image, reweighting stakes with conceptual cost of accepted vulnerability; orientation anchors early at the rusted door; closure lands on-page with felt cost in Rowan's tears and the garden's salt acceptance, though one minor elision in Rowan's arrival slightly softens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned data center turned moss garden is vividly specific, with sensory details like electrolyte and loam smells filtering through Mara's bias; the setting constrains choices, such as harvesting resin from panels, and charges the final image under fern-fronded cables; micro-details like icicle patterns guide actions and mirror internal healing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grafting meaning onto confession wounds tightens with Rowan's arrival and deepens through joint resin-harvesting, narrowing options under textural lens; agency in Mara's proactive mapping and proffering forecloses isolation with visible emotional cost in tears; one meaningful cadence shift suffices, though stakes remain somewhat abstract until the pendant moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of quiet growth amid digital ruin emerges organically from motifs like trapped gnat and mossy servers, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in Rowan's brave-yet-threatened state; subtext in silences and gestures, like proffering without ceremony, invites reflection; final image of dew rehearsing constellations offers resonant, non-literal repricing of vulnerability without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stays stable with Mara's perceptual signature in honeyed hush and constellation mapping; voice texture is distinctively poetic, with rhythmic control in phrases like "honeyed hush" modulating under pressure; sparse dialogue carries subtext, as in Rowan's thick-voiced question, advancing plot naturally; patterned compression teaches early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in sentences like "The garden accepted the salt as another mineral in its slow circuitry" advancing atmosphere and theme; no loops or artifacts, high information density without overwriting; figurative language coheres, as in gauze over bruise, enhancing clarity at peak beats like the pendant exchange.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of whistleblower aftermath in a moss-reclaimed data center transforms eco-tropes through specific details like resin-harvesting for seedlings; non-obvious angle on protected vulnerability heightens stakes via the gnat's perseverance; risk in lyric accumulations feels inevitable, charging the shared roots image without gimmickry.</comment>
