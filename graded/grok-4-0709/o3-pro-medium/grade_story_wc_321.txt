<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Milo's motivation to merge timelines is clear and rooted in his resilient positivity, intensifying to compel the climax choice with the hourglass; interiority is concrete through knot-tying instincts, but emotions lean metaphorical rather than deeply embodied, with limited contradictory impulses in scene. The final renunciation of ignorance carries a felt conceptual cost, earning stasis via acceptance. Relationships with Rowan apply pressure, but secondary characters feel somewhat archetypal without full status dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, patterns of stars, ripples, and sand build density to a resonant reconfiguration at the hourglass turn, with conceptual cost in merged impermanence; orientation anchors early in the harbor fog, and one meaningful cadence shift suffices. Closure lands as Charged Poise in Milo's compass-resetting heart, reweighting options without decisive physical act. Minor ellipsis in vanishing feels motivated but could tighter link to prior causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like luminous moss and rearranged constellations filter through Milo's patient bias, mirroring internal weaving; the spectral grotto constrains choices by trapping the ferry, charging the final reappearance image. Tone tensions poetic promise with dread effectively. Spatial choreography tracks coherently from deck to bow without impossibilities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of not being lost in vanishing tightens via the grotto's pressure, forcing Milo's instinctual alignment with conceptual cost in timeline merging; one deepening suffices, narrowing options through sparking sand. Agency crystallizes in turning the hourglass, but stakes feel somewhat abstract without visceral internal-external interweave. Coincidence of the grotto complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence as woven arrival emerges from recurring images like knots and sand grains, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in passengers' flickering; final image of the hourglass as tide clock offers resonant, non-literal repricing without statement. Subtext in voices as motes enriches complexity. Emotional aftereffect lingers through honest transience, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stays stable with Milo's perceptual signature in pattern-deciphering bias; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax that modulates with vanishing intensity. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying subtext in Rowan's dread-joke. No head-hopping or unmotivated elision; psychic distance serves emotional beats cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose density is high with purposeful metaphors advancing atmosphere, but occasional overwriting in peak beats like "darkness folded open" muddles without full payoff; rhythm varies naturally, and sentences propel via image accumulation. No major loops or artifacts, though some synonym churn in ripple descriptions dulls momentum slightly. Clarity holds at closure with strong verbs and concise integration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vanishing ferry with timeline-merging via patterns feels inevitable, transforming trope through Milo's knot-instinct; risk in poetic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in transient resolve avoids generics. Core premise commits fully without retreat, offering non-obvious angle on loss.</comment>
