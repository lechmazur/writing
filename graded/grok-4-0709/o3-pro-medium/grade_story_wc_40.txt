<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orrin's motivation to decode growth is clear and rooted in curiosity, intensifying through his actions like arranging folios and using the crystal, with interiority concrete via embodied impressions like "weathered innocence coat his tongue." Internal conflict shows in his reticence versus the need to address the tribunal, earning the endurance at closure with felt cost of uncertainty. Strength lies in micro-choices under pressure, such as lifting the crystal to project sequences, revealing values with visible trade-offs. No major flaws, but emotional embodiment leans poetic over contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through layered impressions and pattern breaks like the hush snapping with footsteps, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure where the council retreats, reweighting language's stake with conceptual cost of uncertainty. Orientation anchors early in the library at dawn with Orrin on the floor. Strengths include coherent density increase to the final image of moving roots on the ceiling, with one meaningful cadence shift sufficient. No causality breaks, and closure lands on-page with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The shadowed library at dawn is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like pale light and dust motes filtering through Orrin's bias, constraining choices like touching the crystal to floorboards. Environment charges the final image of light painting roots on the ceiling, mirroring internal growth. Strengths in integration with action, evolving causally as dawn widens. Meets 9+ test by charging closure without slips.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><grade>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, dominant stake of mapping language's botany escalates via density increase when tribunal enters, forcing stance crystallization with cost of potential sabotage rumor. One meaningful deepening suffices, as impressions layer to reweight options at closure. Strength in coherent pressure from hush to echoes, with agency in Orrin's renunciation of prose for rings. Coincidence of arrival complicates without resolving, but cost is legible in council's fear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of language as living growth emerges organically from images like syllables splitting and words as seedlings, with subtext in fractured sequences inviting reflection on change. Final image of hush as breathing futures offers resonant, non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Strength in complexity avoiding tidy binaries, tied to Orrin's arc. Meets 9+ test through conceptual repricing with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic impressions like "dust motes hovered like stalled comets," modulating rhythm under pressure without head-hopping. Purposeful compression in fractured sequences is taught early and paid off at closure. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, like Orrin's gentle address pursuing persuasion. Meets 9+ test with rhythmic control and no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like "the hush tightened, as if the air inhaled," advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled, though some density in peak beats borders on overwriting without muddle. Strength in high information density and clarity at closure, with no artifacts touching the final image. Minor register elevation in poetic diction fits voice but slightly drifts in tribunal scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing language evolution with botany via sonically reflective crystal, transforming tropes through specific details like chimes in facets and fractured sequences. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable at closure. Strength in fresh angle on finalized dictionaries, with authenticity avoiding derivatives. Meets 9+ test with non-obvious synthesis and bold choices.</comment>
