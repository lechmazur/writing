<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to weave truth from rusted lies is clear and intensifies through her trance navigation, compelling the high-stakes choice to confront the monks' denial; interiority is concrete via embodied actions like breath fogging the shrine, with contradictory impulses in her quiet vigilance versus bold instruction. The keeper's flaw of loneliness complicates his release, shown through frostbitten hands pleading, aligning with Earned Stasis in acceptance. Relationships with monks serve as crucible, forcing status shifts when some recoil but others agree, altering the glacier's state. No diagnostic labels mar the emotional progression, which layers realistically in the thawing air's sigh.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through recurring ice and light motifs, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the keeper's departure reweights the glacier's silence with conceptual cost of exposed frailty; orientation anchors early with Mara surfacing beside the Glacier of Bells. Closure lands on-page with felt cost in the glacier's trembling and crying, foreclosing denial's path. One meaningful cadence shift in the final vigil suffices, with no causality breaks despite poetic elision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like resinous smoke and frozen petals mirroring Mara's internal navigation; the setting constrains choices, as the ice wall's translucence reveals trapped memories, charging the final image of blinking air pockets. Micro-setting of the snow globe functions as environment, evolving to refract light and enable the keeper's release. Tone tensions beauty with frailty, supporting theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of exposing truth to free the restless spirit signals early and deepens through dream analysis, narrowing options when monks recoil, forcing Mara's instruction with visible cost in the glacier's tremor; under Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern break in thawing air reweights loneliness to connection. One meaningful intensification suffices, with agency in Mara's vigil crystallizing stance. No coincidental resolutions; pressure coheres to Charged Poise in the lighter silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging truth from wreckage emerges organically through images like the melted globe and frozen petals, inviting reflection on denial's cost without tidy morals; subtext in the keeper's pleading and glacier's cry elicits emotional aftereffect of liberated space. Final image of pilgrims' widened eyes offers resonant, non-literal repricing of beauty's frailty. No thematic statements or false equivalence mar the complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-bound, with perceptual signature in Mara's selective noticing of shimmering breath and runoff sounds; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax that modulates with trance depth, teaching patterned elision early for legibility. Dialogue is natural and subtextual, as in Mara's declarative "Your glacier is a tomb wearing a halo," pursuing exposure without declaration. No head-hopping or register drifts; psychic distance shifts intentionally in the vigil.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in lines like "frozen petals tumbled through the shrine as gentle rain," advancing atmosphere without loops; figurative language is controlled, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the translucent walls. No scaffold or synonym churn; information density high, as glitter drifting recharges motifs. Minor overwriting in descriptive stacks, but clarity holds at closure with strong verbs and clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wreck-diving with glacial ghost whispering transforms tropes through specific details like the Lumen's snow globe fusing with the keeper's memory; ingenuity in dream cameo analysis feels inevitable, heightening stakes without gimmickry. Bold risk in lyric accumulations coheres as singular vision, with no derivative echoes. Core premise commits fully, resisting abstraction via tactile ice and light.</comment>
