<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in curiosity about deleted files, leading to high-stakes defiance against her supervisor; interiority is concrete through embodied actions like her hardening eyes and pounding heart. However, emotions occasionally lean toward stock phrasing, such as "heart pounded," without deeper contradiction in peak moments. The final embrace of liberation earns a meaningful change with felt cost, foreclosing her corporate safety.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong causal linkage drives the plot from investigation to broadcast, with motivated ellipsis in following numbers; orientation anchors early in the archive aisles. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with visible cost in impending punishment, holding under the inferred Causal lens. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length, though the ending's flood of memories feels slightly rushed without fuller causal buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The social network archive is vividly specific, with flickering shelves and humming files constraining Lyra's choices and charging the final image of singing absences; sensory details like glowing gloves and quivering hum integrate into action. Micro-setting of the evidence box and patch evolves causally, mirroring her internal absence. Tone tensions the sci-fi atmosphere purposefully without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding deleted files escalates causally through defiance and broadcast, narrowing options with corporate warnings; one meaningful tightening at the supervisor ping forces stance crystallization under pressure. Cost is legible in jeopardized patents and personal punishment, charging the final image. Coincidence of numbers complicates but does not resolve, fitting the Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of recoverable memories emerges organically from events like unlocking memos and the broadcast, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in corporate suppression; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of deletion as "home." Subtext in absences and songs enriches without direct statement. Emotional aftereffect lingers through the astronauts' thanks, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-bound, with perceptual bias in noticing absences; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax like "brightly attentive gaze." Some register drift into elevated diction, such as "ghostly breadcrumbs," feels slightly unmotivated in stress moments. Dialogue is minimal but natural, advancing plot in transmissions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the opening hum; metaphors like "ants under torn bark" are purposeful without muddle. Minor paraphrase loops, such as repeating "sensed absence," dull momentum slightly in the middle. Clarity and propulsion hold through closure, with no major artifacts touching the ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi archive and data-trapped consciousness transforms missing persons trope through specific details like neural streams and recurring numbers; the premise feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in broadcasting heightens stakes organically without gimmickry. Avoids derivative echoes, committing to implications of sentient metadata.</comment>
