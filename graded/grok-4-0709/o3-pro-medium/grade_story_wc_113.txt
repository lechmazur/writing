<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to unravel the ghost's code is clear and intensifies through her actions, rooted in her exile as a musician, with embodied emotions like soggy resolve during the crank turn; interiority is concrete, showing contradictory impulses in her obsession amid disaster, culminating in an earned renunciation of the building's stasis with felt cost in the upheaval.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images like blotches and ripples, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final silence blossoming with cost of physical fracture; orientation anchors early in the brackish water pit; causality holds via deepening revelations, with the crank turn as a meaningful tightening that reweights the stake without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The flooded opera house is vividly specific, with sensory details like hammering rain and flickering lanterns constraining Mira's choices, such as wading to the crank; the setting evolves causally with the trapdoor opening, charging the final mosaic image and mirroring internal discovery, fulfilling the 9+ test by constraining the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling the code escalates texturally through blotch patterns and harmonic playing, with one meaningful deepening in the trapdoor disruption that narrows options and forces conceptual cost in the building's doom; agency drives the crank push, reweighting silence, though cost is more implied than visceral in the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of music in silence emerges organically from images like unstruck chords and the mosaic credo, offering resonant ambiguity in echoes housing the living without moralizing; subtext in wordless conversation deepens complexity, with the final blank program reweighting the premise non-literally, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Mira's biased noticing of musical patterns in blotches; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, lyric diction like "ripples set the walls shimmering," holding under pressure without elision issues; no dialogue, so policy skips those bullets, fulfilling 9+ with rhythmic control charging the spectral conversation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in phrases like "water quivered like skin under sound" advancing atmosphere without loops; no artifacts obscure closure, with strong verbs and specific images propelling to the rich silence; meets 9+ with zero scaffold and propulsion heightening the mosaic reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghostly code in flood-damaged program transforms opera tropes through specific musical cryptology and disruption, feeling inevitable in the crank turn; risk in lyric, spectral elements heightens stakes without gimmickry, though premise echoes haunted venue archetypes with solid personalization.</comment>
