<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ira's motivation to conquer her self-labyrinth is clear and intensifies through honest acknowledgments, with embodied guilt in the helix descent revealing contradictory impulses. Interiority is concrete via pulse-speeding runes and ozone-scented memories, avoiding stock phrasing. The final choice to diffuse power and concentrate love earns a meaningful reconfiguration with visible cost of extinguished alternate selves. Flaws complicate without hedging, though some emotional progression feels slightly abstracted in the rainlake editing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and deepening recognitions, with causality in motif shifts like shifting runes and splintering timelines. Orientation anchors early in the viaduct's silver puddles and Ira's presence. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration via the rippling rainlake, reweighting identity with felt cost of guilt and extinct Iras, evident in the howling behind brickwork. One meaningful deepening suffices, though ellipsis in timeline branches feels slightly under-motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glowing viaduct after rain is vividly sensory with petrichor, ozone, and prismatic shadows, filtered through Ira's bias and constraining choices like the unfolding arches. Atmosphere tensions the darkening brightness, mirroring internal oscillation. Setting evolves causally, with bricks rearranging into a helix, and the suspended rainlake charges the final image by enabling timeline editing. Micro-details like dripping arches guide action without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of self-conquest signals early and deepens via corridor choices, narrowing options with procedural regeneration under Accumulative lens. Agency in selecting Silence and wiping tyrant-droplets forecloses paths with legible cost of guilt and mass extinction. One meaningful tightening in the helix acknowledgment suffices, though coincidence in rune whispers slightly complicates without resolving. Moral calculus sharpens in choosing love over power, with visible price altering the reorganized world.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of reconstructible identity emerges organically from rune shifts and droplet choices, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in extinguished selves. Subtext in whispers and oscillating glow invites reflection on self-fragmentation. Final image of breathing arches offers resonant, non-literal repricing of gravity and brightness without stating a moral. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through crystalline guilt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in weightless boots and pulse-tied runes, modulating rhythm under pressure like the helix descent. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax and patterned diction, teaching compression early and paying off at rippling closure. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; free indirect style is clean without filter stacks. Elision in timeline howls is purposeful and legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm in unfolding arches and rippling rainlake, avoiding loops or scaffold through concise, multi-job sentences. Figurative language like darkening brightness is coherent without muddle, though some metaphors stack densely in the editors' room. Clarity holds with strong verbs and specific details like petrichor-static taste. Final line recharges motifs effectively, with no artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of timeline fracturing and procedural self-generation feels inevitable through Ira's gravity defiance, transforming tropes with specific costs like howling alternate selves. Bold poetic risks heighten stakes in the rainlake hinge without gimmickry. Authenticity coheres in singular vision of cyclical recognitions. One non-obvious inflection in brightness wounding elevates resonance.</comment>
