<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ashraf's motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly from survival to sacrificial choice, rooted in loss with embodied emotions like "bleak exhilaration" and contradictory impulses at the climax where he hesitates over the bride's memory before acting. Interiority is concrete and particular, showing flaws in his phantom-like persistence without stock epiphanies. Sanaa's secondary pressure forces his condition on non-weaponization, altering their dynamic with mirthless laughter revealing status shifts. The final renunciation earns stasis with visible emotional cost, though some reactions border on poetic abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Structure follows a causal lens with strong because/therefore linkages from blast to journey to descent and closure, where Ashraf's decisive act of surrendering the geode reverses the energy drain, creating a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost in extinguishing his bride's light. Orientation anchors early in the wedding tremor and holds through shards with one transition to the observatory and skiff. One meaningful tightening at the crater deepens knowledge, narrowing options without redundancy. Minor elision in rumors guiding him pays off in arrival, holding the lens without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ravaged plains and floating observatory constrain choices, with the geode as a recurring object charging the final image by dissolving into light, while sensory details like humming crystal and whispering weeds are vivid, POV-filtered, and purposeful, mirroring Ashraf's internal bruises. Atmosphere builds bleak tone through acid clouds and violet dust, evolving causally with events like ground cracking. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from courtyard to crater. The micro-setting of the crystal guides action tactilely, heightening specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of hunting unused potential without weaponization escalates causally through the descent and crater anchoring, with one meaningful tightening at the node's pulse forcing the sacrificial choice, narrowing options and crystallizing stance with legible emotional cost. Pressure coheres under hybrid lens, interweaving internal loss with external threat, though coincidence in the crystal's shielding complicates without resolving. Agency in Ashraf's agreement and final act earns the reconfiguration. Moral calculus sharpens at the hesitation, trading memory for continental safety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of energy's destructive promise emerges organically from events like the blast and reversal, resisting tidy morals through ambiguity in whether Ashraf saved or delayed war, with the final image offering a resonant, non-literal repricing of potential as "less heavy" equilibrium. Subtext in the crystal's hum and Sanaa's laugh invites reflection on invention as ordnance without confusion. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality via bleak exhilaration. Insights arise from concrete struggle, reweighting the premise without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature in Ashraf's biased noticing of energies like rotor hymns, and purposeful compression in journey elision taught early and paid off at closure. Voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, image-rich prose modulating with intensity, like shortened syntax at the ground cracking. Dialogue in Sanaa's murmurs carries subtext and advances plot naturally, distinguishing her academic idiom from Ashraf's scarred reticence. No head-hopping or register mismatch; elision heightens pressure legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing through vivid images like "lavender core" and varied rhythm, though occasional paraphrase loops in energy descriptions slightly dull momentum without obscuring closure. Syntax propels with strong verbs and purposeful fragments, clear in sequence like footfalls triggering thunder. Figurative language integrates without muddle, but minor register drift in phrases like "perturbation theory" feels academic yet voice-motivated. Final line recharges motifs effectively, with zero typos and clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sci-fi elements like quantum cartography with personal loss transforms tropes of survival and energy hunts through specific details like the geode's bridal tie, feeling inevitable in the sacrificial reversal. Risk in poetic compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, offering a fresh angle on war's remnants via "intangibly tangible" promise. Core premise commits to implications of unfiltered awakening without retreat. Emotional complexity avoids generics, with the crater's absent body silhouette a memorable inflection.</comment>
