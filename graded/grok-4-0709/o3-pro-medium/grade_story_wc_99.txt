<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters like Yun and Mara show some interiority through actions like pruning and tracing lace, revealing traits under pressure, but motivations feel abstract and collective rather than individual, with no strong contradictory impulses in scene; the group endurance at the end lacks a visible personal cost, trending mid-range despite coherent flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and a single deepening in the cavern, landing a Conceptual Repricing closure with conceptual cost in softened memories; orientation anchors early via the islet and characters, but causality is loose with elisions like the stair's appearance, holding in strong mid-band without tighter linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The breezy islet after rain vividly anchors atmosphere with cerulean tones and mist, constraining choices like descending the spiral stair and charging the final clear sky image; sensory details like rain beads on pine needles mirror regret, evolving causally without overreach, though occupational depth is absent but unneeded.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding the apology color signals early but escalates minimally via one textural deepening in the cavern under Accumulative lens, with agency in collective actions like planting the bonsai; cost is conceptual but oblique, lacking a sharper trade-off or foreclosure, keeping it functional yet replaceable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken apologies emerges organically through images like lace patterns and diffused mist, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via memories curling into bark without moralizing; subtext in silences and scents enriches complexity, though ambiguity lingers purposefully without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Omniscient POV is stable with clean focalization shifts among characters, teaching a lyric pattern early; voice has distinct rhythmic texture in slow, pruned phrasing, with purposeful elision paid off at closure, but sparse dialogue lacks subtext depth when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose density is high with vivid, multi-job sentences like "the hush that followed seemed to diffuse across the island," varying rhythm without loops; figurative language coheres without muddle, though some metaphors like "cerulean regret" border on overwriting but serve momentum in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of bonsai pruning, lace instructions, and ghostly compass transforms familiar regret tropes into a fresh conceptual quest; risk in abstract lyric form heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable via the cavern reconfiguration.</comment>
