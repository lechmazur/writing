<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Selene's motivation to learn the rhythm of repair is clear and intensifies through her climb and assembly, rooted in consistent traits like her locksmith identity; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions in tears thawing frost at the climax. Internal conflict shows in her apology to reflections, revealing flaws and micro-choices under pressure. No second character, so relationship bullets ignored; the emotional progression layers contradictions realistically, earning the final renunciation of old mistakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural, holding through patterned imagery building to cadence shift in the assembly and descent; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the rhythm reweights repair as invitation, with felt emotional cost in tears and thawed frost. Orientation anchors early in the climb; structure fits two shards (ascent/hall/chamber) with one transition, and causality via motif accumulation feels coherent without breaks. Minor elision in corridor folding is taught and pays off at mirrors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The frozen library and hall of mirrors are vivid, sensory-rich settings that constrain choices, like stepping through rippling mirrors to access books; details filter through Selene's POV, with icicles and milky radiance mirroring her internal thaw. Environment evolves causally, charging the final image of descending with pink horizons; micro-setting of gears and pendulum directly shapes the closure assembly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of learning repair's rhythm tightens through the mirror apology and assembly, deepening via textural pattern break in the ticking rose; under Accumulative lens, this reweights options with emotional cost in tears, though escalation feels more poetic than narrowing. Agency in pressing the mirror and whispering apology drives the heart's reveal; one meaningful deepening suffices, but lacks a sharper trade-off for higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of repair as rhythmic invitation emerges organically from images like the unfurling rose and thawed tears, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in "promises waiting for dawn's gentle knock." Subtext in mirrors confessing failures invites reflection on flaws without confusion; final image offers resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting prior struggles. Earned from particulars, avoiding platitudes, though some metaphors border on overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in lunar-eclipse bias noticing shadows and shimmers; voice texture is distinct, poetic with rhythmic syntax modulating under pressure, like breath ghosting in the climb. Patterned elision in corridors is taught early and legible at closure; no dialogue, so those bullets ignored. Psychic distance shifts intentionally for emotional beats, without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with vivid metaphors like "breath ghosting like pale ribbons" advancing atmosphere; syntactic variety supports rhythm, varying paragraph lengths for visual flow. Minor paraphrase loops in mirror descriptions dull momentum slightly, but no major artifacts obscure closure; information density high, with lines multitasking image and theme. Read-aloud ear test passes, though some stacked figuratives in the chamber border on overwriting without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lunar locksmith and mirror prophecies feels fresh, transforming fantasy tropes through specific details like the crystal pendulum as frozen tear; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, making the conceptual repricing inevitable. Emotional truth in flaw confession avoids generics; core premise offers non-obvious angle on repair, committing fully without retreat.</comment>
