<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ash's motivation to return the ember is clear and rooted in her flawed past as an arsonist, intensifying through embodied emotions like "volcanic tenderness" that compel her choices; interior contradictions shine in her shift from destructive fire to gentle redemption, with micro-choices like tracing stitches revealing values at cost. However, emotional progression occasionally leans on abstract labels rather than pure embodiment, slightly softening peak authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, patterns of clues and motifs build density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the archive, with closure's emotional cost legible in Ash's weeping and the archive's forgiveness; orientation anchors early with Ash's backstory and desert journey. One meaningful deepening suffices, but minor ellipsis in the trail feels more poetic than pressured.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The desert canyons and lost archive are vivid with purposeful sensory details like "dust lifted" and "obsidian doors," constraining choices and charging the final image of living fire; micro-setting of the ember amulet evolves to mirror internal states without overt symbolism. Spatial coherence holds, but some environmental details repeat statically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rescuing the promise tightens through accumulating clues, forcing stance crystallization in returning the ember with felt emotional cost; under Textural lens, pattern breaks like the vandalized portrait deepen pressure effectively. Coincidence in clues complicates without resolving, but agency feels slightly passive in the journey's flow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of redemption through fire and art emerges organically from motifs like intertwined quills and flames, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in stitched eyes and smoke signals invites ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect lands honestly, avoiding sentimentality in the weeping scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual bias in Ash's fire-tinged noticing, like "heat bloom like memory"; poetic voice has distinct rhythm, but occasional register drift into elevated diction feels unmotivated under stress. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision in journey is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density in images like "flames blossomed not outward but inward," propelling momentum; rhythm varies, but some paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated tenderness motifs) and mixed metaphors in peak beats dull clarity slightly. No major artifacts touch closure, but template cadence in descriptive runs triggers minor deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arsonist redemption via artistic clues and a living archive transforms tropes with specific details like the ember amulet; risk in poetic structure heightens stakes organically. Core premise feels inevitable, with no close echoes of familiar scenes.</comment>
