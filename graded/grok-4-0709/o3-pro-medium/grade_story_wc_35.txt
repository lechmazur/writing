<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kilor's motivation to sandpaper memories evolves credibly from professional to personal, shown through micro-choices like pressing Sel's hand to the coral, revealing a hierarchy of values with felt cost in his self-sacrifice. Sel's internal conflict embodies contradictory impulses, as his shame leads to nodding acceptance despite balking at water. However, emotions sometimes lean toward abstract labels like "remorse flowed out like cold ink" without fully contradictory embodiment under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered sensory images and pattern breaks, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Kilor's vigil reweights remorse with conceptual cost, legible in the fortress sighing and Sel breathing without armor. Orientation anchors early with the fortress and drawbridge. Closure lands on-page with felt cost, though some ellipsis in emotional contagion feels slightly unmotivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The desert fortress after rain is vividly specific, with rainwater hissing and forming mirrors that constrain choices and charge the final image of skeletal walls, mirroring internal brittleness. Sensory details like ozone and rust evolve causally, pressuring actions like the pavilion's thawing. Environment guides the emotional contagion through tactile elements, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of redistributing remorse escalates through textural density, tightening in the hand-press moment that narrows options and forces Kilor's sacrifice with visible cost. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens, with one meaningful deepening when sorrow ricochets, crystallizing Sel's stance. However, coincidence in the pavilion cracking slightly complicates without fully resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of remorse as redistributable yet feral emerges organically from images like charred dates and melting brine, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer where humming churns grief into scatterable music. Subtext in silences and implications, like the melody's ambiguous judgment, invites reflection on regret's inescapability. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through complexity, though some ambiguity borders on oblique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person voice maintains consistent perceptual signature through flavor-infused bias, with rhythmic control in dense, poetic syntax that heightens pressure without obscurity. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying subtext in Sel's rasp and whisper. No head-hopping; purposeful compression in elisions like unspoken dreams is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, multi-job sentences like "water still clung to the ramparts like reluctant tears," varying rhythm purposefully without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled, though occasional mixed metaphors like "ants bearing coals" slightly muddle in peak beats. Clarity and propulsion strong, with final line recharging motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of tasting memories and coral-stored remorse transforms familiar regret tropes through specific, ingenious details like tidal pool maps and humming tides, feeling inevitable in Kilor's vigil. Risk-taking in poetic structure heightens stakes organically, committing to the premise without retreat. Fresh angle on emotional contagion avoids generics, with the pavilion's demand as a non-obvious intensification.</comment>
