<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rook and Mira's motivations are rooted in consistent traits like hunger for beauty and resistance, intensifying through choices like reshelving books and scattering word seeds; interiority is concrete via embodied actions, but emotions feel somewhat performed in poetic declarations rather than contradictory impulses in scene, as in Rook's stability line.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned imagery and elision toward a resonant reconfiguration at dawn with conceptual cost of ongoing risk; orientation anchors early in the library under stars, but causality feels loose with magical transformations lacking strict linkage, though the final bloom reweights stakes legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars anchors vividly with purposeful sensory details like creaking roof and silver light, constraining choices like climbing ladders; recurring cracks and beams charge the final image of blooming resistance, evolving causally as rust flakes to reveal steel.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rebuilding via words escalates through accumulative density of metaphors and actions like scattering seeds, with one meaningful deepening as people arrive to heal the building; cost is felt in sirens' threat, but pressure remains somewhat abstract without a sharper trade-off narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of blooming resistance emerges organically from images like word seeds rooting and fractures turning to vines, offering resonant ambiguity in poetry's power without tidy morals; final image of architects smiling at the bloom reweights anarchy into beauty non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient voice is stable with poetic texture in syntax and rhythm, teaching patterned metaphors early; perceptual bias filters through Rook's cartographer lens, but dialogue like "Fear is an obedient architect" feels slightly declarative over subtextual, though it advances the plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose has high density with vivid metaphors like "glittered like broken glass," but overwriting in peak beats creates muddle, such as stacked similes in the opening; minor loops like repeated rattling tin dull momentum slightly, though rhythm varies and clarity holds at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vagrant poet rebuilding library with words transforms trope of artistic resistance through specific details like seed packets of words; risk-taking in magical realism heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in the bloom's reconfiguration.</comment>
