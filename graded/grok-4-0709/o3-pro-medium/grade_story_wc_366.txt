<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ellis's reticence is embodied through micro-choices like pocketing the pebble and naming the shard "Anchor," revealing contradictory impulses between silence and protection that earn the final wary peace with visible cost in his lingering until dawn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through patterned images like stacked stones and glowing glass to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the lamp rekindles, reweighting the dread with conceptual cost in the anchored hush; orientation anchors early with the tide and breakwater, holding without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The skeletal lighthouse and haunted lantern room constrain choices, supplying the pedestal for the shard and stones that charge the final beacon's greenened promise, with sensory details like paraffin and lavender mirroring internal ache.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of protecting the tower from haunting dread tightens through the cairn's message and shard's glow, culminating in agency-driven reconfiguration via the stone reply that rekindles light with felt cost in the cradled silence under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of quiet guardianship emerges through recurring images of chains and stacks, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final braided beacon that reweights superstition as networked protection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Close third-person POV stays stable with Ellis's perceptual signature in selective noticing of wakes and glows; rhythmic prose modulates under pressure, like the gust's citrus scent, with dialogue subtext advancing the chain's pursuit naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid metaphors like "flame buttered the walls" advancing atmosphere without loops or muddle, though some stacked images in the climax approach overwriting but maintain propulsion and clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of haunted lighthouse with stone-code messages and sea-glass chains transforms tropes through Ellis's reticent worldview, heightening stakes in the reply stack without gimmickry.</comment>
