<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to learn building languages is clear and intensifies through choices like renting the attic and accepting Selin's legacy, with embodied contradictions in half-truths and ignorance; Selin's ghostly traits and Polina's guilt create crucible relationships that force the climax revelation. Interiority is concrete via sensory ties to bricks and meteors, though some emotions lean toward poetic summary rather than raw embodiment. The final acceptance forecloses ignorance with felt cost of loss, earning endurance through prior lies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered revelations from tea sessions to seal cracking, culminating in Charged Poise closure where the protagonist owes stories to rooftops with conceptual cost of bound obligation. Orientation anchors early in the rooftop garden during the meteor shower. Causality holds via patterned elisions like unspoken lies, with one meaningful deepening at the murder reveal tightening stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rooftop garden during a meteor shower is vividly specific, with basil pots, old bricks, and thyme constraining choices like seal pressing in rainwater; sensory details like thrummed bricks and rustling chrysanthemums mirror internal loneliness, charging the final image of sorrowful masonry. Micro-setting of the seal and teacups evolves causally, pressuring the climax. Tone tensions mystery with familiarity, supporting thematic half-truths.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of learning building languages escalates through one meaningful deepening at the seal's crack and murder reveal, narrowing options under textural pressure and forcing stance crystallization with felt cost of Selin's dissolution. Agency in accepting the promise forecloses paths via trade-off of secrets. Coherent pressure from lies and meteors complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of resonant half-truths emerges from particulars like agreed lies and building loneliness, culminating in non-literal final image of scattered letters reweighting secrecy without moralizing. Subtext in silences and gestures invites ambiguity on guilt and legacy. Emotional aftereffect lingers through sorrowful rehearsal, avoiding sentiment via complex murderer-student bond.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, sensory noticing of sky syllables and brick words; rhythmic control heightens in pressured beats like the thundercloud lesson without obscurity. Dialogue carries subtext, as in Selin's waterlogged voice and Polina's tearful limestone vowels, advancing revelations naturally. Patterned elision of unspoken squeaks is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like silver syllables stitching between pots, advancing atmosphere without loops; however, some figurative stacking in peak beats like flickering film and steam from pipes risks muddle, though clarity holds at closure. Information density high, with lines multitasking image and theme. No major artifacts obscure cause-effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of anthropomorphic buildings, ghostly tutors, and meteor grammar transforms tropes through specific half-truths and seal's cuneiform, feeling inevitable at the expectant rooftops; risk in lyric compression heightens mysterious familiarity without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on language and lies, committing fully with emotional complexity.</comment>
