<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to decode inscriptions is clear and intensifies through her grief-fueled vigil, with embodied emotions like tears and steadying breath revealing contradictory impulses in the alignment moment. Interiority is concrete, showing her healing trait via micro-choices like broadcasting the verse, earning the endurance of shared burdens with felt cost. No second character on-page, so relationship bullets ignored; single flaw is slight therapy-speak in recalling Ariston's claim, but it doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, density builds through layered images like the daylily telegram and star pulses, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where shared burdens reweight isolation into companionship with conceptual cost of Ariston's despair. Orientation anchors early in the observatory midnight; one meaningful deepening via overlay alignment tightens knowledge without causality breaks. Minor slip in elliptical mentor backstory, but it pays off at closure without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The celestial observatory setting constrains choices, with the telescope and dome slit enabling the pivotal alignment that charges the final image of lingering in midnight solace. Sensory details like red chart lamps and ticking clock are selective, POV-filtered, and evolve with action, mirroring Mira's internal shift. Environment pressures the decoding, supplying resources like the phosphor screen that affect outcome without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding inscriptions to prevent misuse tightens once through the star-glyph alignment, deepening knowledge and forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative/Textural lens, with felt cost in tears and communal invitation. Pressure coheres via internal grief and external star pulses, narrowing options without coincidence resolving. Minor issue: stakes feel somewhat abstract until the broadcast, but closure reweights with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of shared burdens emerges organically from star alignments and decoded ode, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in burden's direction (anchor or propel), inviting reflection through Mira's realization. Subtext in the telegram's fragrance and firefly replies builds resonance without direct statements. Final image offers non-literal answer, reweighting solitude into communal endurance without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Mira's astronomical bias noticing star pulses as Morse; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, lyric diction that modulates with emotional intensity. No dialogue, so those bullets ignored; purposeful compression in reflections teaches pattern and pays off at closure. Minor register drift in elevated metaphors like "spectral ink," but consistent and legible under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid images like "sunset trapped in fiber," varying rhythm purposefully, but occasional paraphrase loops (e.g., repeating "shared burdens" phrasing) and stacked metaphors in the alignment beat dull momentum slightly without obscuring closure. Clarity high, no major artifacts; information density strong as lines advance atmosphere and character. Final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lucid dreaming, variable stars, and ancient glyphs transforms tropes through Mira's specific grief-motivated decoding, feeling inevitable with risk in bold lyric structure that heightens thematic stakes. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on communal healing without gimmickry. Minor hedging in ambiguous burden direction, but authenticity coheres.</comment>
