<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Velasco's motivation to orchestrate serendipity is clear and consistent, driving his actions with analytical precision; secondary characters like the fisher and sculptor reveal traits through tailored coincidences, though their depth remains functional rather than deeply contradictory. Interiority is concrete but limited to Velasco's calculations, avoiding stock phrasing. The final renunciation of the bishop piece earns stasis with a felt cost of trust in chance. Flaws are minor, with no diagnostic label-speak harming peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern breaks in each volunteer's serendipity building to a resonant reconfiguration; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing via the bishop's uncharted float, reweighting randomness with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors early in the tidal arcade under stars. Mosaic structure fits Track B with taught pattern and legible transitions; one meaningful deepening suffices, though causality is more textural than strict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tidal arcade under stars constrains choices vividly, with barnacle-encrusted pillars and tide-puddles shaping actions like dice rolls and walks; sensory details like neon reflections and wave sighs are selective and POV-biased toward Velasco's algorithms. Micro-setting of the table and bishop charges the final image. Tone tensions wonder with calculation purposefully; spatial choreography tracks cleanly across volunteers' moves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of orchestrating serendipity tightens accumulatively through volunteer outcomes, culminating in a cadence shift at fireworks; one meaningful deepening via the bishop's tap forces stance crystallization without coincidental resolution. Agency in Velasco's instructions forecloses monotony with felt costs like the fisher's grief. Pressure coheres under textural lens, though lacks multiple reversals (not required).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of guided randomness emerges organically from events and images like the floating bishop, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in skeptics' notes; subtext in silences and gestures invites reflection on coincidence versus orchestration. Final image offers resonant, non-literal repricing without statement. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete astonishments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable and close to Velasco, with perceptual signature in mathematical noticing like vectors and tempos; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax that modulates with wonder. Dialogue is sparse but natural, like the teenager's shout advancing the anthem turn. No head-hopping; purposeful compression in mosaic shards is taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in lines like "waves sighed against distant bulkheads like a patient audience"; no loops or scaffold, strong verbs propel momentum. Figurative language like "orchestrated serendipity" is coherent without muddle in peaks. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors, but clarity holds at closure; read-aloud flows naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic, math, and serendipity feels organic, transforming street performer trope through tidal setting and volunteer vignettes; risk in mosaic structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in tailored coincidences avoids generics. Core premise commits fully, with bold ambiguity in "calculated wilderness."</comment>
