<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silva's motivation to preserve her agency while unraveling echoes is clear and intensifies through embodied choices, like descending the steps despite fear, revealing contradictory impulses in her pact acceptance. Interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions like "reed-blown melancholy" embodied without stock phrasing. The meaningful endurance in the pact forecloses pure individuality with a felt cost, shown in her sternum ache and final note of grief/release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered echoes and imagery to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the pact, with conceptual cost legible in the melancholy price and grateful silence. Orientation anchors early with Silva as canyon echo singer in desert canyons at dusk. Closure lands on-page with Charged Poise, reweighting her role as mediator, though one minor elision in the merchant's vanishing slightly softens causality without harming the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The desert canyons and serpentine nexus are vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like moon-bleached flats and quivering harmonics constraining Silva's journey and charging the final rim ascent. Micro-setting of the shell and chamber slabs mirrors internal states, evolving causally to reveal steps and luminous threads. Environment pressures choices, such as testing the path with a note, heightening atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of personal agency vs. involuntary echoes tightens through the countdown and descent, deepening in the chamber negotiation where options narrow to a pact with felt cost. Under textural lens, pattern of returning voices intensifies pressure, forcing stance crystallization in acceptance. One meaningful cadence shift suffices, though coincidence of the fissure opening complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of echoes as seeking memories emerges organically from images like vibrating sand and luminous threads, inviting reflection on agency without tidy morals. Subtext in silences and the pact's stillness elicits emotional aftereffect of release amid melancholy. Final image of grateful silence offers resonant, non-literal repricing of communal voices.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward auditory harmonics and echoes, modulating rhythmically under pressure like the sustained note on steps. Prose texture is distinct, with purposeful compression in lyric descriptions taught early and paid off in closure. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in phrases like "moon-bleached flats" advancing atmosphere without loops, though one mixed metaphor ("webs of intrigue from whispered secrets") slightly muddles in a non-peak beat. Clarity holds at closure, with strong verbs and specific nouns; no artifacts touch the final image. Information density high, as lines layer sound, memory, and action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of echoes as memory repositories transforms folklore tropes through Silva's perceptual trait and the shell's countdown, feeling inevitable in the pact's risk-taking that heightens agency stakes. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on lost voices, committed fully without hedging. Bold lyric structure coheres as singular vision, with the chamber's loom a memorable inflection.</comment>
