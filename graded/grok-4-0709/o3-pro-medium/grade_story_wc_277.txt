<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amelia's motivation as a devoted observer drives her curiosity-led choices, with embodied internal conflict between loyalty and truth evident in her gripping the pen nib and weighing ancestral portraits; Felix applies secondary pressure effectively in their dialogue, forcing her stance crystallization; the final renunciation of family denial earns its cost through her visible fear and estate sacrifice, though interiority occasionally slips into stock phrasing like "flared brighter."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure advances through motivated linkages from the call to the observatory meeting and decision, with orientation anchored early via the telephone in Calder House; closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt costs like lawsuits and estate sale, though the orrery's symbolic backward spin feels like a micro turn rather than a full reversal; one meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The echoing observatory setting constrains choices by magnifying footfalls and providing the orrery as a tool that charges the closure, with sensory details like altitude breeze and lightning integrated into action; POV-filtered specifics, such as headlines on spheres mirroring conscience, evolve causally and charge the final image under stars; micro-setting of the pen nib and orrery enhances atmospheric specificity without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of exposing family truth escalates causally from the call to Felix's proof, tightening meaningfully when Amelia weighs loyalty against intervention, foreclosing denial with costs like reputations and estate sale; agency drives the decision, though coincidence of the journalist's call complicates without resolving; one deepening shift suffices, charging the climax effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of responsibility orbiting regret emerges organically through the orrery's headlines and Amelia's scratched groove, reweighting the premise in the final image without moralizing; subtext in Felix's proof by contradiction invites reflection on institutional denial; resonant reconfiguration avoids tidy binaries, though some metaphors like "presses of destiny" border on overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual signature in Amelia's catalogued sensations, and dialogue carries subtext like Felix's mischievous reverence; prose texture is distinct with rhythmic metaphors, but occasional register drift into academic terms like "proof by contradiction" feels unmotivated for her lexicon; no head-hopping, though elision of dirigible ascent compresses without teaching a pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose advances with high density in metaphors like "headlines' reflected light flicker over her conscience," but paraphrase loops appear in repetitive hush and dust motifs, and mixed metaphors like "orbits of regret" with "scratch them open" muddle clarity in peak beats; rhythm varies, yet template cadence in lightning flashes dulls propulsion; no major artifacts touch closure, but overwriting in the final paragraph reduces momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes journalism scandal with steampunk observatory and proof by contradiction in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming tropes through Amelia's observational flaw complicating her intervention; risk-taking in the orrery's symbolic scratch heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in hindsight; avoids derivative templates with specific emotional complexity in her vow.</comment>
