<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amber's motivation to weave continuity through chaos is clear and intensifies her choices, rooted in pacifist traits that compel high-stakes endurance; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like sensing pressure shifts, and her micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost in scarred palms. Cullin's regrets and shift to forgiveness feel earned through their relationship as crucible, forcing a status dynamic change. The father-daughter reunion beat exemplifies contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern breaks in imagery building to Charged Poise closure, where planting seeds reconfigures continuity with conceptual cost of ongoing chaos; orientation anchors early in the dome farm post-tower fall. Causality is motivated through elisions that change knowledge, with one meaningful deepening at the convoy arrival tightening options. The final image of Cullin staying to learn charges the reconfiguration without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glass-domed desert rose farm anchors vividly early, with sensory details like arid wind and petal scents filtered through Amber's perceptive bias, constraining choices like closing vents; environment evolves causally, mirroring internal calm, and charges the final image of planting outside. Micro-setting of rose pots as shields integrates into action, guiding the peaceful negotiation. Tone tensions chaos with tranquility purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving the dome via engraved quiet signals early and deepens once at dusk reunion, narrowing options through council threat; pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens, with cadence shift forcing stance crystallization in rose display, earning reconfiguration with felt cost of potential loss. Agency in Amber's renunciation of weapons forecloses violent paths. Coincidence of sandbag complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of continuity through peaceful roots emerges organically from rose engravings and father-daughter arc, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in Cullin's grief; subtext in gestures like pinching the forgiveness stem invites reflection. Final image of planting outside offers resonant, non-literal repricing of values without statement. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars like scarred palms.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV on Amber with clean shifts, perceptual signature biased toward sensory hush and virtues; voice texture in rhythmic, image-rich prose modulates with intensity, teaching patterned diction early. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, advancing plot with distinct idioms like Cullin's hoarse rust versus Amber's steady lava. No head-hopping or elision issues; syntax reflects focalizer's calm under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel momentum, like in the dusk blaze description; no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle, with strong verbs and specific nouns enhancing clarity. Final line recharges motifs effectively. Zero artifacts in peak beats, passing read-aloud test with natural flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pacifism and engraved plants transforms bounty hunter trope through specific dome setting and virtue cuttings, feeling inevitable with risk in non-violent climax heightening stakes.
