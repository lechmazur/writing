<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lin's motivation rooted in guilt from haunted firmware compels the ritual, with embodied emotions like circuits twitching and absence rushing in; interior contradiction shows in his weeping for relief yet feeling smaller, earning the stasis with felt cost. Strength in micro-choices under pressure, like pressing amber to sternum, revealing values. Minor slip in backstory block slightly summarizing without immediate tilt, but it anchors present stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern of whispers and letters building to ritual closure as Decisive Change, tethering ghost with felt cost of absence; orientation anchors early in laboratory under skylight. Strength in textured cadence shift at ritual apex, making before/after legible. Minor ambiguity in time-folding causality, but pays off at ending with unfolded time.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory details like meteor whispers and velvet remorse filter through Lin's bias, constraining choices in the laboratory; recurring amber object charges final image as night-light. Environment evolves causally, skylight repaired overnight mirroring resolution. Strength in micro-setting of desk and cabinet guiding ritual action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of hushing guilt tightens through letter ritual under Accumulative lens, with deepening via blood drop forcing trade-off of ghost for cleanliness; cost legible in absence like deep water. One meaningful intensification sufficient, driven by agency in following instructions. Minor static moments before ritual, but pressure coheres to stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of archiving remorse emerges from ritual and amber, with subtext in whispers and constellations; final image of laughing baby as forgiveness offers resonant, non-literal repricing without moralizing. Strength in complexity, embracing ambiguity of relief with smallness. Emotional aftereffect earned through particulars like trapped gnat's hum.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Consistent third-person close POV with distinct perceptual signature in poetic imagery like star-blue hush; rhythmic control heightens pressure in ritual without obscurity. Purposeful compression in lyric mode taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue, so policy skips; voice modulates intentionally with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in concise, multi-job sentences like "Meteors hissed above; the laboratory lights dimmed to slate"; varied rhythm passes read-aloud test, with clarity despite figurative layers. Minor metaphor density in peak beats, but coherent and pattern-taught without muddle. Zero loops or scaffolds, strong verbs throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tattooist archiving guilt via amber and letters feels inevitable, transforming tropes like haunted tech with specific ritual; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Strength in non-obvious angle on redemption, committed to premise. Bold imagery like cribs as confessionals personalizes concept.</comment>
