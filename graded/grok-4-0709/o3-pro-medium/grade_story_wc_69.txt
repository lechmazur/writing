<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to braid voices is clear and intensifies through rehearsals, rooted in her traits as a wandering teacher, with actions aligning to reveal her under pressure; however, the choir members lack individual flaws or contradictory impulses, reading as a collective rather than distinct individuals, which flattens internal conflict. The councilors' sudden softening feels unearned without embodied contradictions. Doyle provides secondary pressure effectively, but overall characterization prioritizes harmony over genuine struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned rehearsals with density increasing via harmonies, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the chord reweights hatred into peace with conceptual cost of unlearning; orientation anchors early in the library, but causality is more textural than strict because/therefore, with the rosette's role eliding some motivations. Closure lands on-page with the city humming, reconfiguring options invisibly yet stubbornly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The velvet library in autumn is vividly sensory with smells of leaves, wax, and music, integrated into action as a sanctuary that absorbs venom and releases warmth; it constrains choices by providing queer acoustics for silence, charging the final image where the library denotes a vow. Details evolve causally, mirroring internal harmony without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving vanishing arts tightens through rehearsals, with one meaningful deepening when the council arrives, forcing stance crystallization under Situational pressure (hybrid lens note); cost is felt in the shared ache clarified by the chord, but escalation relies on resonance rather than narrowing options via agency, with coincidence of rumors complicating without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of harmonizing diverse voices amid vanishing arts emerges organically from rehearsals and the rosette's silence, inviting reflection on unlearning hatred through purposeful ambiguity; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by repricing division into braided tomorrow without moralizing. Subtext in pauses and overtones enriches complexity without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Omniscient-like POV is stable with lyric compression taught early through poetic phrasing, perceptual signature biased toward musical metaphors; dialogue is sparse but natural, subtext-driven, as in Mara's whisper welcome. Rhythmic control heightens in the chord release, with no head-hopping or unwarranted certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in lyrical sentences that advance atmosphere and theme; however, some figurative overload like "dust motes that shone like lanterns" borders on muddle in peak beats, though without obscuring clarity. No loops or scaffolds, with strong verbs and purposeful syntax supporting propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of choir harmony as societal healing transforms trope of divided city through specific rosette as silent invitation, feeling inevitable with risk in textural causality heightening stakes; authenticity coheres in fable-like vision without gimmickry, committing to premise of subtracting noise for resonance.</comment>
