<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to interpret celestial signals and repurpose endings is clear and intensifies through her actions, rooted in mentor-taught traits; interiority is concrete with embodied serenity amid cold, though internal conflict lacks strong contradictory impulses in scene. The final renunciation of the fragment's charge earns stasis with felt cost, but flaws feel somewhat archetypal without bold moral ambiguity. Key moment: placing the fragment atop the pylon reveals value hierarchy through sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and hush shards toward a Resonant Reconfiguration, with the fragment's repurposing creating a legible before/after in the revived landscape; closure lands with conceptual cost as the spent artifact signals ongoing cycles. Orientation anchors early in the tower city over the gorge. Persistent constraint of time and powerless lifts shapes tactics, though some elisions feel more poetic than pressured.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned radio tower city and gorge setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like struck quartz smell and fog pulsing in squares mirroring internal states; the environment constrains choices, as the glider launch and fissure glitter charge the retrieval and final image. Micro-setting of the pylon and fragment directly enables the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding beginnings in endings tightens through the perigee hush, deepening via the glider descent and repurposing; under Accumulative lens, pattern shifts reweight cost with the fragment's glow and spent warmth. Agency drives the renunciation, foreclosing silence with visible revival, though coincidence of the signal complicates without resolving. Pivotal moment: dismantling the receiver narrows options with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of repurposing endings into beginnings emerges organically from hush shards and fragment ritual, with subtext in images like the silver ribbon river; the final image offers resonant repricing without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through ambiguity of new questions, avoiding sentimentality. Strength in particulars like the glowing coils charging the conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, selective noticing like moonlight sliding and hush as glass; rhythmic control heightens pressure in beats like the launch, with patterned elision taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue present, so not evaluated. Prose texture modulates serenely under stress without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, vivid metaphors like "fog pulsed in squares" advancing atmosphere without loops; syntactic variety supports rhythm, though some figurative stacks in peak beats like the hush refraction border on muddle without harming clarity. No artifacts obscure closure; final line resolves with charged image. Strength in propulsion during glider descent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of celestial interpretation and Hollywood fragment in a fantasy-practical tone transforms tropes through specific choices like discarding assumptions; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with non-obvious angle on silence and revival. Key ingenuity: repurposing the artifact as a stage light for photons.</comment>
