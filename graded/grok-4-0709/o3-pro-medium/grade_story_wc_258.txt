<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strength in Mirelle's consistent traits as a cartomancer rooted in craft, with motivations intensifying through the reading to compel her advisory reply; Jonas's curiosity drives his confession, revealing values with visible cost in his cracked steadiness. Interiority is concrete via perceptual details like rainlight on cheeks, though emotions lean slightly toward summary in the votive lantern metaphor. Flaws complicate choices authentically, as Jonas owns catastrophe by placing zero at his heart, earning the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned imagery and revelations in one continuous loft scene, with orientation anchored early via rain and skylight; closure lands as Charged Poise in Jonas's skylight stare reconfiguring rain as threads, with felt cost of shared responsibility confessed on-page. Causality holds via textural density increase from shuffling to spiral expansion, though one minor ellipsis in card shimmering feels unmotivated. Persistent constraint of the tape shapes tactics toward convergence on rituals.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere vividly selective with rain-beaded skylight and wet plaster smell mirroring bewilderment, constraining choices like aligning the tape; recurring tape object charges final image by evolving from relic to timeline, with thunder stitching streets to keep secrets alone. Sensory details filtered through Mirelle's bias, evolving causally with events. Micro-setting of table and cards guides the reading's intimacy without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, dominant stake of mapping patterns escalates via density increase in card-tape interplay, deepening to reweight trust and heat as currencies with one meaningful cadence shift at the spiral expansion; cost legible in Jonas's gasp and confession, foreclosing solitary paths. Pressure coherent but coincidence of shimmering glyphs slightly complicates without fully resolving. Agency in Mirelle's urging and Jonas's pointing crystallizes stance with ethical sharpening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of shared mystery and belonging emerges organically from tape's coordinates and cards' revelations, resisting tidy morals via ambiguity in following alone or with others; final image of rain as threads offers resonant, non-literal repricing of isolation without stated thesis. Subtext in gestures like unspooling the tape and leaving the wallet elicits lingering reflection on communal regrowth. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars like the coinless wallet.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stable with perceptual signature in Mirelle's craft-biased noticing, like tape intriguing more than statistics; voice texture distinct in rhythmic, image-rich prose modulating with intensity, as in thunder's hush. Dialogue natural and subtextual, pursuing goals like Jonas's whisper echoing as key, distinguishing idioms without convergence. Patterned elision in lyric descriptions taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose dense with purposeful rhythm in varying sentences, advancing atmosphere via images like silver needles, but minor scaffold in paraphrase loops around "multiplying paths" echoing dulls propulsion slightly. Figurative language controlled without muddle, though one mixed metaphor in "stitched the city" borders contradictory. Clarity high with strong verbs, no major artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartomancy and data archeology in post-crash world transforms tropes through specific tape runes and volcanic pigments, feeling inevitable in hindsight; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, as in tape as timeline repricing collapse. Originality in conceptual integrity of reverse engineering futures for belonging, avoiding stock echoes.</comment>
