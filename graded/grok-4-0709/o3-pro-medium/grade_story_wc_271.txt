<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Anisa's motivation to anchor optimism in realism is clear and intensifies through embodied choices, like leading the tour despite freezing, revealing contradictory impulses in her trauma response. Interiority is concrete, with emotions embodied in physical cues like chest tightening, avoiding stock phrasing. Malik's secondary presence applies pressure via their relationship, forcing her stance crystallization with felt cost in shared stillness. The 9+ test is met through on-page contradictory impulses and earned endurance, though minor therapy-speak in interiority slightly hedges emotional rawness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through recurring images like the pearl and stillness, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final balcony moment where options reconfigure with conceptual cost of refracting light through ruins. Orientation anchors early in the arboretum setting by dawn, with no disorientation debt. Closure lands on-page with felt cost in the horizon's cobalt thread stitching tomorrow, and a persistent constraint of trauma shapes tactics throughout. The cost proof test is satisfied in the absurd physics image that reweights grief without pretending ruins are gone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The arboretum on a seaside cliff is vividly anchored early, with sensory details like salt wind and brine scent filtered through Anisa's POV, constraining choices like designing somatic stations amid palms. Environment charges the final image, as the balcony overlooks black water and gulls become silhouettes, reweighting stakes. Micro-setting of glass walls trembling with wind mirrors internal states, guiding the tour's calm-mapping exercise. The 9+ test is met as the setting directly constrains the climax tour and charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of anchoring optimism tightens through the tour's somatic exercises, deepening via Anisa's freeze moment that forces stance crystallization with visible cost in Malik's pulse-guiding touch. Under Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates via motif density, with one meaningful cadence shift in the pearl nested in the lens reweighting hope. Agency in her decision to lead onward despite thunder echoes embodies endurance with felt price. The 9+ test falls short as agency drives deepening but cost, while unmistakable, could be more viscerally layered in the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of trauma rerouted toward unexpected blossoms emerges organically from horticultural metaphors and somatic practices, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in absurd physics refracting light through ruins. Subtext in silences, like Malik's scaffold-like quiet, and the pearl motif invites reflection on stillness without direct statements. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to anchoring hope, reweighting prior wreckage via the horizon's thread. The 9+ test is met, though a hairline slip in explicit "anchor optimism in realism" echoes thematic statement slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Anisa's selective noticing of sick leaves and salt air, modulating rhythm under pressure like shortened breaths during thunder. Dialogue is natural, subtext-laden, and advances plot, as in her "I almost froze" revealing trauma without declaration. Prose texture is distinct in lyrical syntax, teaching patterned elision early and paying off at closure. The 9+ test is satisfied with rhythmic control and no elision issues or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like "salt wind skated" accelerating atmosphere without loops or scaffold; no paraphrase churn or template cadence appears. Figurative language is controlled, with metaphors like vines rerouting sap enhancing momentum in peak beats. Clarity shines in the closure image of the horizon's cobalt thread, with zero artifacts dulling it. The 9+ test is met through propulsion and clean craft, though one mixed metaphor in "gulls wheeling like loose gears" is a hairline slip.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing trauma recovery with horticultural neuroscience, transforming tropes like survivor guilt via fresh somatic markers and pearl motif that feels inevitable in the lighthouse lens image. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to conceptual integrity. No derivative echoes, with emotional specificity in "panic ordered her muscles to freeze" avoiding generics. A non-obvious synthesis elevates, though familiarity in seaside healing archetype caps at hairline from perfection.</comment>
