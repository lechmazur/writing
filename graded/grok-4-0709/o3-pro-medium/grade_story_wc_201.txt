<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to discover the mathematics of mercy is clear and intensifies through embodied trauma responses, with contradictory impulses like despair versus bracing shown in scene, culminating in an earned conceptual renunciation with felt cost. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, as in the line where suffering plots a curve. No second character is on-page, so relationship bullets are ignored; the single-POV interior contradiction and micro-choices under pressure are strong but lack a visible hierarchy of values in the peak moment, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned sensory and reflective elisions to a Conceptual Repricing closure where mercy is reweighted as a transformation, with conceptual cost legible in the displaced yet rooted hymn of absolution. Orientation anchors who (survivor), where (ultraviolet forest), and when (post-anesthesia) by ~120 words, waiving any penalty. The pattern of trauma-triggered memory and ultraviolet convergence holds coherently, with one meaningful deepening at the formula recalculation shaping the final image; no causality breaks, but the ending's open recursion feels slightly undercharged for full resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like flickering violet and radiating lichen filtered through the enhanced POV, constraining choices like triangulating toward convergence and charging the final image of the whispering proofs. Micro-setting elements, such as the damp moss and cedar root, embody urgency and mirror internal states without overt symbolism. Environment evolves causally, affecting action as drones hesitate at the clearing's edge, with tone supporting the thematic penance; a recurring object (mask strap) further charges closure, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of discovering mercy's mathematics signals early and deepens through a pattern break at the formula recalculation, reweighting options with the cost of infinite intolerance inverted to vulnerability. One meaningful intensification via the ozone smell igniting synapses forces stance crystallization, with agency in renunciation driving the resonant shift. Cost is unmistakable in the luminous, unfinished bloodstream carry; however, coincidence in the forest's sanctuary slightly complicates without fully resolving, holding back from higher bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of mercy as transformation emerges organically from concrete events like the strap's conductivity and formula projection, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights cruelty as a negative exponent without stated moral, satisfying the 9+ test. Subtext operates in ultraviolet imagery and trauma responses, inviting reflection through ambiguity in the recursive ending. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars, embracing complexity without false equivalence; the core concept integrates tightly, avoiding thematic echo in the final whisper.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The first-person POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in ultraviolet-tasting lichen and proprioceptive rhythms, modulating rhythm under pressure like short, firing steps in pain. Patterned elision in trauma jerks is taught early and paid off at recalculation, with diction and syntax reflecting the focalizer's mathematical mindset. No dialogue present, so those bullets are ignored; purposeful compression heightens emotional beats without head-hopping or register drift, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density in lines like "suffering, too, plots a curve" advancing atmosphere and theme without loops. Figurative language is controlled, but occasional overwriting in stacked metaphors like "luminous as confessionals" slightly muddles clarity in the peak beat, triggering a -0.4 deduction. Rhythm varies naturally, sentences propel with strong verbs, and no artifacts touch closure; however, some synonym churn in "violet... ultraviolet" repeats without taught pattern, limiting to strong but not exceptional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes sci-fi enhancement with mathematical mercy in a non-obvious way, feeling inevitable through trauma responses and forest penance, with risk-taking in lyric structure heightening stakes via conceptual cost. Tropes like survivor escape are transformed by ultraviolet specifics and thematic inversion, offering fresh emotional truth in the reciprocal formula. Authenticity coheres as a singular vision, with the strap's evolving use providing a bold, organic inflection; proximity check clears, as no close echoes mar originality.</comment>
