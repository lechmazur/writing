<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to discover memory textures through fragment collection is clear and intensifies via micro-choices like pocketing the label, revealing contradictory impulses of reclamation versus erasure; interiority is concrete and embodied, with flaws like perceptual tilting driving genuine struggle without stock phrasing. The earned stasis of remaining nameless forecloses visible paths with felt cost in the final pocket-warming moment. No second character interacts on-page, so relationship bullets are ignored, but single-POV depth excels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through layered fragments toward a resonant reconfiguration in the ending's charged poise, with conceptual cost of enduring namelessness made legible via the tide's sigh and label's pulse; orientation anchors early in the misty port labyrinth. Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis, foreclosing identity reclamation with undeniable pressure, though one ellipsis in footsteps' pursuit feels slightly undermotivated without sharper linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The port city's container labyrinth is vividly specific, with sensory details like rusted doors and turquoise paint trails constraining choices and charging the final image of rearranging walls; atmosphere mirrors the protagonist's erased state through tidal rhythms and sodium lights, evolving causally without static repetition. Micro-setting of the refrigerated container deepens the thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, dominant stake of surviving erasure escalates via density increase in layered gleanings and pattern break with the label's discovery, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost of potential discovery; one meaningful deepening suffices, though coincidence of the burst crate slightly complicates without fully resolving. Agency in slipping the label forecloses options authentically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of erased histories emerges organically from collected fragments and taped confessions, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the final image of the label's seep and tide's agreement, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost without moralizing; subtext in ghosts and murmurs invites lingering ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect feels honest and complex.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person voice is distinct and perceptual, with rhythmic control in poetic syntax like "erasing footprints before they harden" holding under pressure; purposeful compression teaches patterns early, paying off at closure without opacity. No dialogue present, so those bullets ignored; elision of names fits the nameless tone legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in lines like "Gulls eat the discarded ledgers" advancing atmosphere and theme without loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak moments like the footsteps' pursuit. High information density layers multiple jobs per sentence cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of bureaucratic ghost and memory collection feels inevitable, transforming tropes like poison survival into fresh ingenuity via textured layering; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, as in the label's quiet pulse agreeing with the plan. Bold commitment to nameless perspective coheres as singular vision.</comment>
