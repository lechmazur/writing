<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Emil's motivation to discover the color of sound is rooted in a specific childhood lullaby, driving concrete choices like boarding the Narwhal, with internal conflict shown through his hiding behind truth; emotions are embodied in his heart hammering as colorless static, leading to an earned vow that forecloses his gray footsteps with visible cost. Strengths include character-specific interiority avoiding stock phrasing, but minor abstraction in emotional progression slightly dilutes embodiment at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of lanterns and hues toward a resonant reconfiguration in the vow, with conceptual cost legible in the shift from hidden to honest sound; orientation anchors early with Emil on the pier, and causality holds via motivated ellipsis like the door swinging open. Closure lands on-page as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting sound's promise with undeniable hope, though one soft ellipsis (Narwhal surfacing) mildly undercuts pressure buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The harbor and sunken library settings constrain choices, with the low tide enabling access and kelp-webbed shelves charging the discovery; sensory details like brine vapor and koi-shaped shadows are vivid, POV-filtered, and evolve causally, mirroring Emil's internal hues. The library as micro-setting directly charges the final aurora image, meeting the 9+ test by shaping the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering sound's color escalates texturally through deepening images, tightening in the library with the cobalt ledger forcing stance crystallization; agency drives the vow as renunciation of hiding, with felt cost in his prior colorless static. Under Accumulative lens, one cadence shift suffices, but coincidence of the door opening slightly complicates without fully resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of sound's color as honest promise emerges from particulars like the indigo lullaby and resonant vows, culminating in a non-literal final image of oar-splashes painting notes; subtext in silences and implications avoids direct statements, inviting reflection on hidden truths. Resonance arises organically without moralizing, though one abstract realization ("resonance possessed hue because it possessed hope") borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in synesthetic images like footsteps blooming in color; prose texture uses rhythmic, purposeful compression taught early, paying off in closure without head-hopping. Elision in transitions like descending the hatch is motivated and legible; minimal dialogue is natural and subtextual in the vow declaration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in lantern ascents and aurora bursts; no loops or scaffolds, strong verbs like "gnawed" and "cascaded" propel without overwriting. Figurative language coheres without muddle, but one mixed metaphor ("meteor hush cloaking the tide with ash-soft silence") slightly strains in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia and maritime folklore transforms tropes through specific details like the number seven tag and indigo lullaby, feeling inevitable with risk in the poetic vow heightening stakes; originality in conceptualizing sound's color as honest promise avoids generics. Bold lyric structure coheres without gimmickry, though premise echoes familiar quest narratives mildly.</comment>
