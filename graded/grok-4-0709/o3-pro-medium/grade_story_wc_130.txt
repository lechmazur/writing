<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Eridian's motivation to mathematize emotion is rooted in his loss of Lio, shown through embodied actions like pacing and kneeling, with contradictory impulses in persisting despite blurred numbers; the final renunciation of closure for rhythm feels earned with the visible cost of a contracted yet describable ache, foreclosing full resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and elisions to a Conceptual Repricing closure where loss is reweighted as a continuing function with felt cost in the measurable curve of pain; orientation anchors early in the cavern orchard, but minor ambiguity in the mosaic's sudden coherence slightly softens causality without breaking the pattern's payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The cavern orchard with dripping stalactites and pulsing pomegranates is vividly specific, filtering through Eridian's perceptual bias; it constrains choices by providing the mosaic and drips that enable the realization, charging the final image of mist curling upward with thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resolving ambiguous loss tightens through the mosaic discovery and lute-plucking test, deepening via a cadence shift that reweights grief with the cost of enduring pain; under the Accumulative lens, this single intensification forces stance crystallization without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of loss as a hovering influence emerges organically from images like blurred ink and pulsing fruit, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer in the final orchard rhythm that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in silences and implications invites lingering ambiguity on grief's rhythm versus closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The third-person close POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature in mathematical and sensory noticing, like equations on robes; rhythmic prose modulates with emotional intensity, teaching patterned elision early and paying it off in the looping translations to stabilize patterns, with no head-hopping or unwarranted certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the dripping metronomes without loops or scaffold; figurative language dovetails coherently, as in fruit pulsing like pocket hearths, propelling toward closure, though one mixed metaphor in "pocket hearths" slightly muddles but doesn't obscure the peak realization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief as mathematical rhythm in a magical orchard transforms familiar loss tropes through specific details like Hope Fractions and glass eyes completing mosaics; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the whispered theorem that thanks silence.</comment>
