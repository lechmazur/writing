<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to understand healing through another's story is clear and intensifies via micro-choices like agreeing to write and composing aloud, with embodied emotions in scents and breaths; Selene's contradictory impulses between projection and visibility drive her request authentically. Status dynamics shine in her urgent eyes and thread handover, pressuring his craft. However, some interiority veers toward diagnostic self-awareness, like "geography of healing," slightly abstracting the crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of absence and projection to a resonant Conceptual Repricing at the end, where the narrator's healing finds its "first coordinate" with conceptual cost in unfinished stars and absent ships. Orientation anchors early in the garden and autumn setting. Closure lands on-page with felt reconfiguration, though one ellipsis in her departure feels mildly unmotivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The shadowed garden in autumn constrains choices, with frost-stiff rose and skeletal oak mirroring inner bruises and scribbling constellations that charge the final image of unfinished stars. Sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, like copper bars and scuttling leaves sounding like applause, evolving causally to frost-filmed bench. Environment pressures the intimate exchange, heightening urgency before winter erases paths.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping inner healing escalates texturally through deepening anecdotes and thread handover, tightening to a cadence shift where her words reweight his motive with felt cost in paired ghosts and lonesome splendor. One meaningful deepening suffices, driven by agency in listening and composing. Coincidence of summons complicates without resolving; cost is legible in her vanishing and his stirred embers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of explained absences as healing geography emerges organically from images like bruised petals and carpet thread, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer: obituary as compass, reweighting sorrow bordering hope without moralizing. Subtext in silences and projections invites reflection on disappearance. Emotional aftereffect lingers through unfinished stories, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, traveler's idiom, like scents matching profession; rhythmic control heightens under moonlight with purposeful compression in her whispered request. Dialogue carries subtext, pursuing intimacy via thread and corrections, distinguishing voices—his reflective, hers urgent. No head-hopping; elision in her projection is taught and paid off at departure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid metaphors like branches scribbling constellations, varying rhythm from slanted daylight to midnight toll; high information density advances atmosphere without loops. Some figurative muddle in "pulse without seeing my face" slightly clutters, but no artifacts obscure closure. Clarity shines in final line's warm thread and unsung pulse.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of living obituaries and projected presence transforms absence tropes into a fresh geography of healing, with risk in lyric structure heightening stakes via thread as pulse. Non-obvious angle on disappearance feels inevitable, committing to premise without hedging. Bold intimacy in composing aloud recharges motifs organically.</comment>
