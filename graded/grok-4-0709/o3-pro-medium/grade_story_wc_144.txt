<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as a blind artisan is rooted in consistent traits like sensory intuition, intensifying through repair choices that reveal her faith under pressure; Rowan's interiority is concrete, with embodied admiration in lines like "feeling the drone straighten like a spine freed from pain." Strengths include micro-choices showing value hierarchies, such as prioritizing tungsten grains, but minor weakness in lacking contradictory impulses during tests, though the calm endurance earns stasis with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned sensory details like ripple sounds and light refractions, leading to a Charged Poise closure where the drone's return reconfigures harmony with undeniable calm; orientation anchors early in the depot setting by ~50 words. Strength in density increase via basin sequences tightening toward release, with felt cost in the depot's deepened hush; no causality breaks, though ellipsis in relay feels motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mist-coated rail depot anchors vividly with sensory details like steam whistles and harbor mist, constraining choices through water basins that charge the repair beats and final image; micro-setting of basins mirrors internal calm, evolving causally with ripples. Strength in POV-filtered specificity, such as "lattice sunlight," reflecting Mara's bias; environment pressures tactics, like the anchor's rumble setting the clock.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of syncing schedules escalates via accumulative basin tests, deepening with each ripple diagnosis that narrows repair options and raises time pressure from the anchor lift; one meaningful intensification suffices, with visible cost in potential timetable splintering. Strength in agency through Mara's renunciation of sight for auditory faith, crystallizing stance; coincidence of dawn light complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of decoding hidden patterns emerges from repair images and motifs like ripples speaking truths, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via Mara's line "Direction is only hidden until we decode the feedback we already carry," reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in silences and gestures, like the drone's humble chirr, invites reflection on faith amid noise; emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete vibrations as scripture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person POV from Rowan is stable, with perceptual signature in tactile details like "fingers that memorized every dented hinge"; voice texture distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax modulating with calm, such as short sentences during tests. Dialogue natural and subtextual, like Mara's murmurs advancing plot; no head-hopping, elision taught in sensory compressions paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere like "Dawn seeped through the iron lattice" without loops; rhythm varies naturally, though minor figurative muddle in "magnetic calm anchored in her chest" slightly obscures in a peak beat. No artifacts touch closure, with strong verbs and specificity; final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of blind repair via water refraction transforms trope of artisan wisdom into non-obvious calm amid industrial chaos, feeling inevitable through basin patterns; risk in lyric sensory dominance heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh angle on faith through mechanical drone, with authenticity in voice avoiding stock morals.</comment>
