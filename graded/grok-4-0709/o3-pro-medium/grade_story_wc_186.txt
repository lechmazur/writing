<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lioh's motivation to rekindle the beacon is clear and intensifies through retrocognitive visions, compelling higher-stakes choices like aligning the shard despite warnings; interiority is concrete and embodied, with emotions like longing and fear contradicting in moments such as cupping the tremor. The final endurance earns a reconfiguration with felt cost in exhaustion and the prism's further cracking. Strengths shine in micro-choices revealing values, but slight stock phrasing in emotional summaries like "weary irony" limits the high band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned visions and alignments to a Conceptual Repricing where coincidences gain meaning, with on-page closure in the beacon's glow and world's tilt carrying conceptual cost of lost civilization's weight. Orientation anchors early in the ruined coast and pavilion. Strengths in density increase via recurring shards and star paths, but minor causality softness in vision floods lacks a sharper persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The glass humming pavilion constrains choices through its trembling panes and machinery, charging the final image as light blossoms; sensory details are vivid and purposeful, with salted winds and gull feathers mirroring isolation and hope. Micro-setting like the astrolabe and prism evolves causally, guiding action under POV bias. Exceptional integration where environment pressures the climax alignment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving coincidences' meaning tightens through the seventy-third evening's alignment, deepening via visions that narrow options and reweight knowledge with conceptual cost in the prism's cracks. Under Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates via shard slivers embedding, driven by agency in singing the melody. Strength in moral calculus between hush's risk and hope's filament, but coincidence-driven resolution slightly undercuts full agency at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of coincidences as meaningful emerges organically from visions and shards, culminating in a resonant final image where the world's lean reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in images like thistle-blown hope and reversed rivers invites reflection on purpose amid ruin. Exceptional emotional aftereffect through sea-folk's weeping, embracing complexity in errant gestures proving deliberate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in poetic noticing of salted air and star paths, modulating rhythm under pressure like trembling glass. Prose texture distinct in syntax and imagery, teaching patterned elision in visions that pay off at closure. No dialogue, so policy skips; elision purposeful and legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and theme through vivid images like "ribs of fallen towers like flutes carved from bone"; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops or scaffold. Figurative language coherent without muddle, as in "hush deeper than silence washed through," propelling to closure. Minor register elevation in peak beats like "reciprocal longing" is voice-motivated in lyric mode.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic custodian with retrocognition and hush shards transforms tropes through specific visions like the boy's coin tilting the axis, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes via accumulative patterns without gimmickry. Authenticity in vision of coincidences as lost gods' messages commits fully, avoiding safety hedging.</comment>
