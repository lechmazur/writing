<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Neris's motivation to mend the mask and ground the spirit is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like threading the needle and unraveling knots, revealing embodied contradictions in her cautious whispers amid unrest. Interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions layered through sensory details like the metallic taste, avoiding stock phrasing. However, internal conflict alternates more than acts simultaneously in key beats, slightly softening the hierarchy of values at the climax bow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through knot-unraveling beats that deepen knowledge of the spirit's backstory, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the spirit descends into the mask with a felt cost of redirected applause and accumulated silence. Orientation anchors who (Neris), where (prism sanctuary), and when (under starlight) by the first sentence, with no disorientation debt. Closure lands on-page with conceptual repricing of hush as gentle rather than cold, though one more explicit cost tie-in could elevate it further.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is vividly specific, with fractured reflections and rattling prisms constraining Neris's actions and charging the final image of hanging the mask in the eastern apse facing dawn. Sensory details like salt-smelling net and hissing gull cries are purposeful, filtered through POV bias, and evolve causally as silence cracks. Environment mirrors internal hush accumulation, and the micro-setting of the net and needle directly shapes the ritual's outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grounding the restless spirit tightens through accumulating revelations from unraveled knots, deepening pressure via fishermen's memories and the actor's fusion, under the Accumulative/Textural lens. One meaningful cadence shift occurs at the final knot pause, narrowing options and forcing recognition with visible cost in the spirit's snarls and sanctuary's trembling. Agency drives the ritual, but coincidence in the spirits gathering complicates without resolving, keeping escalation coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of recognition and mercy emerges organically from knot-unraveling and applause redirection, with subtext in images like frost on glass and sighing stars inviting reflection on silence's dual nature. The final image of the mask facing dawn offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of hush as building rather than choking, embracing complexity without tidy morals. Emotional aftereffect lingers through the vast sea inside undone knots, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward metallic tastes and humming fragments, modulating rhythm from restless to gentle hush. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax and patterned elision, like "across sharing a secret," taught early and paid off at closure without obscurity. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; no head-hopping or register drift under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "petals of white and gold" without loops or scaffold, though some metaphors stack densely in the ritual beat without muddle. Rhythm varies naturally, with syntactic variety accelerating in unraveling sequences and breathing at the pause. No artifacts obscure closure, but one mixed metaphor ("snarled from the rafters" amid sea imagery) slightly frays coherence, deducted here only.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mask restoration with spirit-grounding via star-bleeding net feels inevitable, transforming tropes like haunted objects through specific details like lighthouse-iron needle and drowned applause. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, offering a fresh angle on recognition's cost. No derivative echoes; authenticity coheres in singular fantastical vision.</comment>
