<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Celeste's motivation to map probabilities through graffiti is clear and rooted in her gambler-father scars, with embodied emotions like the "stab" of memory compelling her choices; internal contradictions shine in her rebellion against syllabi while clinging to patterns. The final renunciation of taming odds feels earned with visible emotional cost in tears and shards, but secondary characters like the boy are underdeveloped, applying minimal pressure. Quick test passed via simultaneous impulses in the library climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, graffiti and lantern motifs accumulate density toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where breaking the pane reweights chaos as forgivable, with felt cost in tears and uncertainty's friendship; orientation anchors early in the library and subway. One meaningful deepening suffices, but ellipsis in father's note arrival feels coincidental, slightly weakening causality without breaking the pattern. Cost is legible in the cracked glass sound like shuffled decks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rainwashed library and subway settings constrain choices, with damp carriages and glistening walls mirroring Celeste's melancholy and pressuring her quest; sensory details like asphalt-clover smell and squeaking shoes are vivid, POV-filtered, and evolve causally. The lantern as recurring object charges the final image, constraining her heel-lift action. Quick test passed as environment shapes the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of forgiving chaos escalates texturally through graffiti patterns and memories, deepening to a stance crystallization when she breaks the pane, foreclosing control with emotional cost; one tightening via the note's discovery suffices under the lens. Agency drives the heel-crack, but coincidence in the lantern's placement complicates without fully resolving. Quick test passed with unmistakable cost in the shards.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of embracing lucid contradictions emerges organically from graffiti datasets and lantern motifs, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the broken pane's honest light, reweighting loss and bloom without moralizing. Subtext in silences and implications, like the father's note, invites reflection on forgiveness. Quick test passed, though some direct statements like "uncertainty... like a quiet friend" border on assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in statistical ledgers and graffiti interpretations biasing notice; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, image-dense syntax like "afternoon light dripped like diluted jade." Brief dialogue with the boy feels natural and subtextual, advancing her reflection. Quick test passed with rhythmic control under pressure in the climax, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere via vivid images like "silver drops streaked... into migrating constellations"; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops except minor synonym churn in probability descriptions. Figurative language coheres without muddle, propelling to the closure crack sound. Quick test passed with zero major artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of probability, graffiti divination, and lantern symbolism transforms gambler tropes into a non-obvious quest for forgiving chaos, with risk in lyric accumulation heightening stakes organically. The premise commits fully, avoiding generics, but echoes familiar redemption arcs slightly hedge boldness. Quick test passed with inevitable hindsight in the pane-breaking.</comment>
