<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation as a neutral witness is clear and intensifies compellingly, with internal conflict shown through contradictory impulses like the tug of conscience against the oath, embodied in the moment of watching the rising water. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, as seen in "neutrality feel like treason." The final endurance forecloses intervention with a felt cost of unspoken heart, earning credibility without safety-hedging. Flaws complicate choices authentically, though emotional progression layers subtly without overt hypocrisy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of folding/unfolding and silence, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise on the boat, where the internalized silence reweights the oath with conceptual cost evident in "learning to stand on shards." Orientation anchors early in the library catacombs, serving closure by contrasting the refuge's hush. One meaningful deepening occurs as corridors unfold with the swan, tightening knowledge without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting details are vivid and purposeful, with the catacombs' moss and mushrooms filtering through POV bias, while the obsidian refuge constrains choices by yielding to touch and charging the final riverbank image with rising floodwater mirroring internal fractures. Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure, like mistaking hush for roaring water, and spatial choreography tracks coherently from library to river. The micro-setting of the origami swan functions as a tool that evolves and charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of witnessing without judgment signals early and deepens via the rising water, forcing stance crystallization under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with a meaningful tightening as the oath tugs against intervention, narrowing options with felt cost in enduring the unspoken heart. Agency manifests in renunciation, foreclosing ascent with legible price that charges the final image. Moral calculus sharpens the peak choice between neutrality and mending fractures.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of regenerative silence amid crumbling peace emerges organically from images like the swan's folds and obsidian mirrors, inviting reflection through ambiguity without confusion, as the final boat drift offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of neutrality's cost. Subtext operates in implications of mirrors showing surrender, earning wisdom from particulars like blank journals. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality, embracing complexity in the oath's tug.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward poetic noticing, like "reality slip" matching the loose grip trait, and rhythmic control heightens pressure in unfolding corridors without obscurity. Patterned elision in lyric mode is taught early via metaphors and pays off at closure. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; prose texture is distinct and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with syntactic variety and strong verbs advancing atmosphere, as in "hallway mouths yawning like patient graves," though heavy figurative language in peak beats like the refuge entry borders on muddle without harming clarity. No loops or scaffold, high information density, and read-aloud rhythm varies naturally. Final line resolves by recharging the swan's motif with momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of origami swan as travel method and regenerative silence as conceptual refuge, feeling inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in lyric structure heightening stakes without gimmickry. Premise transforms familiar lost-knowledge tropes through specific details like blank-eyed replicas, committing fully without retreat. Fresh inflection in refolding the swan into a boat reconfigures the journey organically.</comment>
