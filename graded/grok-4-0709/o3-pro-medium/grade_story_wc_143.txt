<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Halina's motivation as a purposefully curious inspector is clear and intensifies through embodied emotions like nervous condensation on her visor, compelling her to outlast the wind for the photograph; interior conflict shows in her whispered benediction amid tremors, revealing contradictory impulses of reverence and duty. The final renunciation of the natural eruptions is earned with felt emotional cost in the clinging melancholy, foreclosing unmanufactured mornings. Strengths include character-specific perceptions under stress, with no stock phrasing; a minor slip in over-articulated sorrow at the end slightly hedges ambiguity but doesn't undermine the hierarchy of values shown in her micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elision of seismic songs and flares, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final descent where melancholy residue reweights the stake with conceptual cost of lost natural silence. Orientation anchors early with Halina on Mons Vesper's summit, and causality holds via textural density increase without breaks. Closure lands on-page with felt cost in carrying the mountain's goodbye, though the drones' arrival feels slightly coincidental without complicating pressure. One meaningful deepening suffices, with the plume's eruption as a pattern break that charges the ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The moonlit summit constrains choices through bitter wind and tremors, charging the final image of vanishing steam with rose-gold tint; sensory details like mineral smell and static on the tongue are selective, POV-biased, and evolve causally with the eruption. Micro-setting of the vial and flares integrates into action, mirroring internal melancholy without overt symbolism. Environment affects tactics, as Earthlight and dawn pressure the timing; this elevates to 9+ as the summit directly shapes the closure's reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of photographing the last plume tightens through textural escalation of flares illuminating phases, narrowing options as dawn approaches and drones buzz in; one meaningful deepening via the vial's trigger forces stance crystallization with felt cost of sensorial sorrow. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with the plume's thinning as a cadence shift reweighting stakes. Agency in endurance forecloses natural eruptions' path; minor deduction for abstract 9+ quick test passed, but coincidence of drones complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of preserving memory against engineered forgetfulness emerges organically from images like the cracked vial and thinning wisps, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the clinging frost-like residue without moralizing. Subtext in silence and hush invites ambiguity about progress's cost, earned through Halina's struggle. Final image reweights the premise with conceptual repricing of unmanufactured mornings; strong emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality, though slight thematic echo in "shining longer through memory" trends toward assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Halina's geologic reverence and sensory bias toward crystals and isotopes; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, lyric compression that teaches patterned elision early and pays off at closure. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; diction modulates with pressure, like soft cracks and hisses under stress, maintaining coherence. 9+ test met with no elision obscuring clarity, though minor register drift in "dawning hush folding" feels slightly elevated for POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like dragon-scale shadows without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the eruption beat. Figurative language is controlled, with no muddle in peak moments like the plume's unfurling. Minor artifact in repetitive "hush" phrasing touches momentum but doesn't dull closure; overall propulsion strong, passing 9+ test but capped for slight template cadence in setup lines.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi elegy transforms volcano trope through specific vial legend and chemical flares, feeling inevitable with risk in quiet, accumulative structure heightening melancholy stakes. Emotional specificity in sensorial sorrow avoids generics; core premise offers non-obvious angle on preservation amid progress. Bold lyric compression coheres without gimmickry, earning risk bonus; no derivative echoes, though museum theft motif borders familiar but is personalized.</comment>
