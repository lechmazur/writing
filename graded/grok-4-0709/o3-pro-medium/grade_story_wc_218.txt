<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to foster interspecies respect is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in her terminal diagnosis, leading to higher-stakes choices like wiring the orchard. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses of calm acceptance and urgent action shown in her "brazen calm" during climbs and soldering. The final endurance forecloses her life path with felt cost, evident in her lying among roots as dawn seeps through, earning the resonant close without stock epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered actions and images, with orientation anchored early in the atoll and temple orchard. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing via the revealed diagrams showing shared branching math, reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost of Mara's impending death. Persistent constraint of her six-month timeline shapes tactics, like matching breaths to breakers, though one minor ellipsis in village reactions slightly softens causality mid-story.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The temple orchard setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like roots ribbing colonnades and vines through slits constraining Mara's wiring actions and charging the final image of glowing pillars. Environment mirrors her internal state, evolving causally as sea completes circuits, and spatial choreography tracks cleanly, such as her climb up the breadfruit trunk. This micro-setting directly pressures choices, like using tidal tables for tasks, elevating specificity without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of fostering respect before death signals early and tightens accumulatively through her experiment, with one meaningful deepening when dolphins synchronize, narrowing options as time collapses. Pressure coheres under Textural lens, forcing stance crystallization in the final listening, with legible cost of her shrinking months felt in translucent sleep slivers. Agency via renunciation earns the close, though coincidence of wreckage oaks slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of interspecies interconnectedness emerges organically from images like copper lattices translating sap to chords, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer via shared branching diagrams without moralizing. Subtext in gestures, like the priest's tingle and echo, invites reflection on respect's complexity, with emotional aftereffect honest and unsentimental in Mara's satisfied exhale. Final image reweights prior material, embracing ambiguity as trees converse in a braided language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature selective to Mara's botanical bias, like sketching stamens amid death's deadline. Voice texture distinct in looping tide-like syntax and rhythmic control, modulating with pressure in salt-sweet fugue without register drift. Patterned elision taught early pays off at closure, with no head-hopping or unwarranted certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in sentences like "roots ribbed its colonnades, and vines chimneyed through clerestory slits" advancing atmosphere and character without loops or scaffold. Information density high, every line multitasking, as in the chord blossoming to shake memory yet cradle it, free of artifacts or muddle in peak beats. Clarity and concision shine in the final hush, grafting her pulse outward with strong verbs and specific nouns.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of terminal illness with eco-wiring experiment transforms familiar deathbed tropes through specific details like crab-pollinated blossoms and nautilus-spiral copper. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable as roots speak across saline distances. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on respect, committing fully without hedging.</comment>
