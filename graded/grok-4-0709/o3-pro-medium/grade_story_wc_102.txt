<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysander's motivation is clear and intensifies through spiritual curiosity, compelling choices like using the Tear and breathing rituals; interiority is concrete with embodied emotions in breaths and sparks, showing contradictory impulses in welcoming ache while seeking healing. The final renunciation of regrets earns a meaningful change with felt cost, as regrets leave as sparks. No second character, so relationship bullets ignored; backstory anchors via meditation cue, tilting present stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and realizations to a Conceptual Repricing closure where unused love is reweighted as seeded light, with conceptual cost in confronting withheld expression; orientation anchors early with Lysander under the viaduct. Pattern of elision in visions pays off at ending; one meaningful deepening suffices, with cost legible in the tremor and sparks departing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The twilight viaduct with mist and wisteria is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices by providing a ritual space and charging the final image as open arms; sensory details like mauve snow and glowing arches reflect POV bias and evolve with events. Micro-setting of the camera tent integrates action; environment mirrors internal states subtly through brightening vines.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding unused love tightens through breathing and visions, with one deepening in the doorway revelation forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative lens; cost is felt in the ache and released regrets, narrowing options to release rather than store. Agency in renunciation forecloses withholding; no multiple reversals required.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of releasing unused love emerges from images like sparks and bamboo tubes, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in inverted projections and regrets adds complexity. Emotional aftereffect lingers through ambiguity of healed present; insights earned via specific visions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, longing-filtered noticing; voice texture in rhythmic, image-dense prose modulates with intensity, teaching patterned diction early. No dialogue; elision in visions is purposeful and paid off at closure without confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purposeful rhythm and varied syntax, advancing atmosphere through metaphors like "mauve snow"; some figurative density in visions borders on muddle but pays off without obscuring closure. No loops or artifacts in peak beats; final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of camera obscura, past lives, and mercy gem transforms spiritual journey tropes through specific visions and breathing method; risk in lyric density heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the seeded dusk revelation.</comment>
