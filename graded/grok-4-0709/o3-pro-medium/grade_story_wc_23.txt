<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marrow's motivation to navigate loss is clear and intensifies through her building and final renunciation, rooted in her patchwork traits with embodied emotion in moments like tears blurring projections. Interior conflict shows in her trembling hands and recalled memories, culminating in earned stasis with felt cost of permanence. Strengths include concrete interiority avoiding stock phrasing, though some emotions lean toward poetic abstraction rather than raw contradiction in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images of migration and grief, leading to resonant reconfiguration in Marrow's decision to stay, with conceptual cost of her fluctuating self made legible in the final image. Orientation anchors early in the starlit station post-failure. Closure lands as Earned Stasis with undeniable pressure, though some elliptical jumps slightly soften causal traceability without breaking the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the signal station's failing hydraulics and receiver dish constraining choices, while micro-details like cooling metal and fluttering charts mirror internal grief. Environment charges the final image as the station drifts in orbital dusk, glowing with returned light. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, evolving causally to support theme without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reversing sorrows tightens through building the tower, deepening via phone lessons and memories, forcing stance crystallization in her refusal to leave with visible cost of collapse. Under Textural lens, pattern shift reweights grief with raw solace. One meaningful deepening suffices, but coincidence of the ringing phone slightly complicates without fully resolving pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of navigating loss through reverse migration emerges organically from images and actions, culminating in a resonant final image of forgiven footsteps without stated moral. Subtext in silences and projections invites reflection on grief's geography. Emotional aftereffect is concrete via unsaid farewells, embracing complexity without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in lunar-tinged sensations and patchwork skin tingles, modulating rhythm under pressure like whirring tower beats. Voice is poetic and consistent, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. Dialogue in phone calls carries subtext and advances knowledge naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like the humming station and whirring tower, advancing atmosphere without loops. Figurative language is controlled, though some stacked metaphors in memory spills risk muddle but pay off in closure. High information density shines in lines like "raw solace pooled in her copper joints," with zero artifacts touching the ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sci-fi elements with grief elegy feels inevitable, transforming migration trope through Marrow's seams as compass lines. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, as in the tower's blood-powered motors. Fresh angle on loss avoids generics, committing fully to premise with bold, specific imagery.</comment>
