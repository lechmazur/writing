<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marietta's motivation to reinvent herself and rebuild trust is clear and rooted in her traits as a former pigeon trainer, intensifying through micro-choices like sketching dust patterns and releasing the bird; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in her hesitation before the skylight. Emotions are layered with credible irrationality, avoiding therapy-speak, as seen in her realization that trust is "the moment you release the bird anyway." Flaws complicate choices without hedging, leading to an earned stasis with felt cost in the final exhale.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, patterns of dust motes and paper trails build density toward a cadence shift in the bird's release, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost legible in the ash settling like "gray snow" and her balanced bloom/wither. Orientation anchors who (Marietta), where (attic), and when (late spring, dawn) by line 3, serving closure without debt. Causality holds through motif accumulation rather than strict therefore links, with one meaningful deepening in the decision to send the meteorite.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The vintage bookshop attic is vividly anchored with purposeful sensory details like cracked skylight and lavender straw, filtered through Marietta's biased perception; it constrains choices by providing the aerodrome rafters and skylight for pigeon flights, charging the final image as wind scatters papers. Micro-setting of dust motes under the skylight evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Tone tensions blooming/withering beauty supports theme organically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rebuilding trust signals early and deepens through accumulative pressure of motifs, culminating in one meaningful tightening when hesitation gives way to release, foreclosing safety with felt cost of potential interception. Agency in renunciation drives the Charged Poise ending under textural lens, with moral calculus between preserving songs and risking betrayal sharpening the choice. Coincidence (graduate's delivery) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of trust as fragile release emerges organically from dust patterns, pigeon flights, and meteorite's melody, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the blooming/withering balance; final image offers resonant, non-literal repricing of her exile without stated epiphany. Subtext in gestures like palms up and paper burning invites reflection on reinvention's cost. Emotional aftereffect lingers through concrete particulars like ash as "gray snow," avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Marietta's biased noticing of dust as musical notes; prose texture is distinct with rhythmic, patterned diction that teaches lyric compression early and pays off at closure. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; free indirect style is clean, with psychic distance shifting intentionally for emotional beats like the hesitation. Elision of present action into reflection tilts stance via micro-choices, fitting BRR allowance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "dust danced" and "ash settled like gray snow," but minor paraphrase loops (e.g., repeating "paper trails" motifs without fresh pressure) and mixed metaphors (blooming/withering in adjacent lines) slightly dull momentum in reflective blocks. Rhythm varies naturally, with syntactic variety supporting propulsion; no major artifacts touch closure, though elevated diction like "lodestone" feels tonally consistent. Opening anchors voice; final line resolves with resonant image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of pigeon training, Mars meteorite, and dust-mapping as musical notation feels inevitable, transforming tropes of exile and trust through specific, grounded choices like the aerodrome in rafters. Bold risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, offering fresh angle on preservation amid suspicion. No close echoes of famous scenes; authenticity coheres as singular vision.</comment>
