<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as a contemplative glassblower is clear and intensifies through her stubborn purpose amid isolation, with embodied emotions like exhaled breath and gloved palm measurements revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. Interiority is concrete, showing internal conflict from past silence thawing without stock phrasing. The final renunciation of abandonment earns its cost through prior causality, foreclosing retreat with felt hope. However, flaws feel slightly balanced rather than complicating choices with raw ambiguity, capping at high band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned imagery of thawing and glassblowing, with orientation anchored early in the polar control room during spring melt. Closure lands as Charged Poise in the final step into the day, reconfiguring options with conceptual cost of thawed regret legible in the shimmering reflection. One meaningful deepening tightens via the dome's creation and bookmark clue, holding the lens without contradiction. Minor elision in backstory pays off by tilting present stance, but lacks a persistent constraint shaping tactics for top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned polar control room anchors vividly with rusted doorway, faded monitors, and hissing rivulets, constraining choices like furnace placement on a console. Sensory details like fogged breath and ice sighs are selective, POV-biased, and evolve causally with the thaw mirroring Mira's internal state. Environment charges the final image as sunlight christens the dome, with micro-setting of glass and bookmark directly shaping closure. Idiom matches the isolated, philosophical locale without caricature, elevating to high band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of crafting safe zones signals early and deepens once through dome creation, narrowing options amid thawing pressures under Accumulative/Textural lens. Agency via renunciation of abandonment forecloses isolation with felt cost in the lightened responsibility. Moral calculus between inquiry and bureaucracy sharpens the choice, but coincidence of bookmark discovery complicates without fully resolving, holding back from higher escalation. One tightening suffices for length, with visible price in the thawed heart.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of thawing hearts emerges organically from images of melting ice and glassblowing, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in isolation's cost. Subtext in narration and bookmark implies unspoken questions, eliciting emotional aftereffect through Mira's alight face. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer to inquiry's safety without stating it, reweighting premise via conceptual repricing. Coherent without false equivalence, but slightly overt symbolism in "thawing heart" echoes thesis, preventing perfect integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Mira's dramatic narration and biased noticing of aurora and rivulets. Prose texture distinct in rhythmic, metaphorical syntax that modulates with isolation's weight, teaching patterned elision early for legibility. Dialogue (self-narration) feels natural, goal-driven to steady nerves, carrying subtext of lightness amid gravity. No head-hopping, but minor register drift in elevated diction under stress slightly jars voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like "molten glass bloomed like sunrise" advancing atmosphere without loops. Figurative language is purposeful but dense in peak beats, with mixed metaphors like "weighty lightness" occasionally muddling clarity without payoff. No major artifacts, but template cadence in narration sequences ("Behold the noble...") repeats stems, dulling propulsion slightly. Opening anchors voice strongly, final line resolves with resonant image, but overwriting in descriptions touches momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glassblowing in polar thaw transforms solitude trope through specific details like cobalt sand and bookmark coordinates, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes via philosophical echoes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on inquiry amid abandonment, with emotional specificity avoiding generics. Minor echo of famous thawing motifs lacks full transformation, but bold commitment elevates.</comment>
