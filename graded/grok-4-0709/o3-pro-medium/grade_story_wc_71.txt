<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to understand living houses is clear and intensifies through her actions, rooted in her gift as a creeping normality noticer, with interiority concrete via embodied perceptions like pulse slowing. Emotions are embodied in contradictory ways, such as inadvertent profundity startling her, and micro-choices like placing the orris root reveal values with felt cost in the house's response. The final realization earns endurance by prior causality, foreclosing isolation with warmth seeping from walls. No second character, so relationship bullets ignored; strengths in flawed, individual traits without stereotypes support the score, though some epiphanies border on stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images and elisions to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Mara reweights house aliveness via object placement, with felt cost in the mute house's translated hush and quickening breath. Orientation anchors who (Mara), where (quiet bay, cottage), and when (threshold hour) by ~100 words, serving closure without penalty. One meaningful deepening tightens via the swan's tilt and wishbone, reconfiguring options with undeniable pressure. Strengths in held lens and on-page cost at "warmth seeped from the walls" justify the score, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting anchors early in the quiet bay in spring, with vivid, selective sensory details like rattling bus and watery sand filtered through Mara's bias, constraining choices as the sea-green door tugs her. Atmosphere evolves causally, with streetlight daydream mirroring threshold light and charging the final image where gulls scream and tide reclaims sand. Micro-setting of the cottage interior, like rut worn by chair legs, pressures actions and mirrors loneliness, charging closure with paint chips aligning. Environment constrains and charges the final reconfiguration, meeting 9+ test without anachronisms or generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding house aliveness signals early and deepens via one meaningful cadence shift when the orris root releases scent, narrowing options and forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative/Textural lens. Pressure coheres through coherent situational elements like displaced objects, with agency in Mara's renunciation of loneliness via sanctification, foreclosing mute silence with visible cost in the tremor's heartbeat echo. Coincidence like swan's tilt complicates but does not resolve; moral calculus between wound and warning sharpens the peak. Score reflects earned escalation with unmistakable on-page cost, though no multiple reversals expected at length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of objects holding histories and houses awakening through true placement emerges organically from events like the orris root and swan displacement, inviting reflection on loneliness without tidy morals. Subtext in images like charred wishbone implies complexity, with the final image offering a resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting premise via warmth seeping and paint scales. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars, though some insights like "loneliness can carve deeper than knives" border on platitude. No thematic echo or moralizing penalizes; resonance from particulars supports score without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Mara's biased noticing of thresholds and hushes, and rhythmic control in poetic syntax that heightens pressure without obscurity. Purposeful compression and patterned diction like "threshold-taste" are taught early and paid off at closure, with no head-hopping or register drift. Limited dialogue ("I am here to sanctify") feels natural, subtextual, and advances plot via walls exhaling. Distinct texture in word choice and prose as character meet 9+ test, with elision legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "paint peeled in scrolls" without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in actions like placing the swan. No artifacts obscure closure, with clean grammar and purposeful syntax supporting propulsion, though some metaphors like "hushed blaze" risk muddle but cohere. Information density high in multi-job lines, and final line recharges motifs effectively. Zero loops and clear propulsion in peak beats support score, with no overwriting penalties applied.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mystical object displacement awakening houses feels inevitable through Mara's gift, transforming tropes like haunted cottages via specific details like orris root remembering rooms. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, with fresh angle on aliveness emerging from grounded choices. No derivative echoes or hedging; authenticity coheres as singular vision. Specific non-obvious inflection at wishbone offering charges closure, meeting 9+ test with organic ingenuity.</comment>
