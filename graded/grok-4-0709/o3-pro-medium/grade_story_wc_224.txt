<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to understand home is clear and intensifies through embodied choices like etching symbols, revealing contradictory impulses between fear and rediscovery; interiority is concrete via sensory metaphors like "ground glass behind the eyes." The seer's status as guide applies pressure, forcing the journey's start. Flaws complicate choices, as buried talents stir with regret's weight, leading to an earned reconfiguration without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elisions and deepening images, with orientation anchored early in the valley and mountain; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via the spoken word that reweights home as portable, with conceptual cost in ongoing planting. Persistent constraint of the reorganizing bookstore shapes tactics, culminating in the linear path reveal. One meaningful deepening suffices, paid off with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices like following the feather-map through phosphorescent corridors; sensory details like "quiet thunder" and "breathing biographies" reflect POV bias and mirror internal blurring. Environment evolves causally, charging the final sunlit entrance with reconfiguration. A recurring object (lost language stone) constrains the climax, elevating specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rediscovering home signals early and deepens via textural cadence shift during the tremor, narrowing options and forcing the seeding action with felt cost in risking entombment. Protagonist agency drives escalation through etching and speaking, reweighting the stake without coincidence resolving it. Moral calculus between pain and belonging sharpens the peak, with one tightening sufficient under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of home as portable direction emerges organically from images like the pulsing stone and seeded talents, inviting reflection through ambiguity in unfinished visions without confusion. Subtext in silences and implications, like the seer's mirror eyes, elicits emotional aftereffect of grateful exhale. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer to belonging, reweighting premise with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with perceptual signature in textured metaphors like "softness pulsed like distant thunder," modulating rhythm under pressure without head-hopping. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances plot, as the seer's whisper urges entry. Patterned diction teaches compression, paid off at closure with legible effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like spiraling shelves and quivering maps advancing atmosphere; metaphors are coherent, though occasional density in peak beats like the tremor risks muddle without harming clarity. No loops or scaffolds obscure cause; information density high, with final line recharging motifs effectively. Minor figurative stacking in vault description deducts slightly but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bookstore-mountain and language stone transforms journey tropes through specific, inevitable metaphors like word-doors and seeded talents, heightening stakes organically. Risk in lyric compression elevates coherence without gimmickry, committing to premise with non-obvious reconfiguration. Emotional specificity avoids generics, feeling singular.</comment>
