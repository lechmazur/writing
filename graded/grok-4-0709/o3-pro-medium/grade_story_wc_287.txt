<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Milo's wistfully pragmatic motivation drives consistent choices, like polishing the tooth and repairing the prism, with embodied emotions in his chest-shift and purpose-instilling; interior conflict shows through his risk for Nara, earning the endurance in stewardship; the relationship with Nara acts as a crucible, forcing the descent despite her frailty, with visible cost in her trembling hands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, patterned images like oars' rhythm and light reflections accumulate to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final image of the glowing rosebush, with conceptual cost of permanent stewardship; orientation anchors early with the balcony and harbor; closure lands on-page with reconfiguration of hope, though causality feels more poetic than strict linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The luminous harbor and floodgate chamber constrain choices, like the algae-slick ladder and mirrored walls shaping Milo's descent and repair; sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, with moonlight varnishing the current mirroring internal hope; the setting charges the final image, as the tower becomes the heart of light-nursing, elevating resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reflecting light into Nara's darkness tightens through the prism repair and her descent, with a meaningful deepening as the fissure widens, forcing stewardship; under textural lens, cadence shifts reweight cost in vulnerability; agency in Milo's choices drives escalation, with felt cost in risk, though coincidence of the tooth's fit complicates slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of nurturing light amid decay emerges through images like the dropped petal and sealed prism, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in ongoing stewardship; subtext in protected vulnerability invites reflection on hope's cost; the final image of the glowing rosebush offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration of dawn without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent third-person close POV with poetic texture in syntax and rhythm, like recurring oar phrases, taught early and paid off; perceptual signature biases toward luminous, wistful details; minor register drift in elevated diction under pressure, but no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose has high density with purposeful metaphors like "quivering hush" advancing atmosphere, but occasional paraphrase loops, such as repeated "rhythm of oars in water," dull momentum slightly; rhythm varies, yet dense figuratives in peak beats like the chamber repair risk muddle without full payoff; no major artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of urban magical realism with the lockmaster's tooth and sunken chamber transforming familiar hope tropes through specific harbor stewardship; risk in poetic structure heightens stakes organically; core premise feels inevitable, avoiding stock echoes.</comment>
