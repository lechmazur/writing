<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to preserve the carnival while shielding her family is clear and intensifies through high-stakes choices like stealing the chip, revealing contradictory impulses in her dual allegiance that act simultaneously during the heist. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like exhaling a held breath at the end, and her orderly intuitive trait constrains actions with visible costs, such as reorganizing into committees. The meaningful change—evolving dual allegiance into "dual lungs"—is earned by causality, foreclosing betrayal with felt relational costs. Flaws like hopeful desperation complicate choices without hedging, elevating the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages, like drafting graffiti leading to the distraction and theft, culminating in a decisive change where the mayor concedes public trust with the chip embedded, carrying visible costs of ongoing vigilance. Orientation anchors who (Mira), where (floating carnival city), and when (equatorial current, pre-privatization) by the first 120 words. Structure fits Mosaic Track B with legible shards over weeks, taught early via rumor-mapping, and one meaningful tightening at the heist. Closure lands on-page with resonant reconfiguration, though minor ellipsis in hearings slightly softens traceability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating raft city setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like calliope smoke and brine filtering through Mira's biased perception, constraining choices such as loosening bridge boards for distraction. Atmosphere of perpetual carnival mirrors internal hopeful desperation, evolving causally with events like glowing graffiti at dusk. A recurring object—the foundation stone chip—charges the final image by being set into the dais, reweighting ownership. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, with environment affecting actions like slipping through the skylight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of navigating gentrification is signaled early and escalates causally through one meaningful tightening—the heist amid parade distraction—that narrows options and raises costs like potential panic. Pressure coheres under causal lens, forcing stance crystallization in reorganizing committees, with visible prices like delayed vote buying time but breeding chaos. Agency drives resolution via Mira's decisions, foreclosing privatization with felt costs of constant patrolling. Coincidence (crowd following breadcrumbs) complicates but does not resolve, though stakes occasionally feel abstract amid poetic density.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of balancing tradition and change emerges organically from events like graffiti encoding revolution, inviting reflection through ambiguity in dual allegiance without confusion. Subtext in images like puckered bunting and dual lungs offers resonant, non-literal answer to gentrification, reweighting premise with conceptual cost of shared mosaic ownership. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars, avoiding sentimentality, with final image of deciphering tourists charging complexity. Insights are earned via struggle, though thematic echo in "hopeful desperation" slightly overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature selective to Mira's orderly intuition, noticing chaos like sheet music and modulating rhythm under pressure, such as terse whispers during the parade. Voice texture is distinct in poetic syntax and word choice, like "calliope smoke and brine," consistent without head-hopping. Patterned elision in shard transitions is taught early and pays off at closure, with prose reflecting focalizer's state. No dialogue present, so ignored; purposeful compression heightens emotional beats without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in sentences like the opening's clacking Ferris wheels, advancing atmosphere and character without loops or scaffold. Information density is high, lines multitasking via metaphors like "puckered like a held breath" that integrate action; no figurative muddle or register drift. Clarity shines in sequence, with strong verbs and specific nouns; final line recharges motifs effectively. Minor synonym churn in "hopeful, desperate" repeats but doesn't dull closure, keeping propulsion intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the floating carnival premise, synthesizing gentrification with ancestral legends and graffiti encoding for a fresh angle on community preservation, feeling inevitable via Mira's specific choices. Tropes like heist are transformed through ultraviolet hieroglyphs and raft-city logic, with bold risk in mosaic structure heightening stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generics, committing to hopeful desperation's implications. A non-obvious synthesis in embedding the chip reconfigures ownership, elevating via risk that coheres closure.</comment>
