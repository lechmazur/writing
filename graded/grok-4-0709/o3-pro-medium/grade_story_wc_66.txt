<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mila's motivation to resurrect stories is clear and rooted in her copyist traits, intensifying through persistent actions like tuning her throat to match the antenna, revealing a hierarchy of values with the cost of exhaustion. Interiority is concrete via rosin-scented fingers and humming, showing embodied emotion under pressure without stock phrasing. However, internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in key scenes, trending toward poetic resolve rather than raw hypocrisy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through patterned images like dust and glow, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where stories embed in the city with conceptual cost of regime threat, making before/after legible. Orientation anchors early in the ember alcove, and one meaningful cadence shift at the antenna crackle tightens the stake. Closure lands on-page with the dust forming a new epic, charged by prior elisions paid off in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ember alcove and mist anchor early, with sensory details like salt crystals and seawater trickle constraining choices, such as aligning vellum to complete the score, charging the final image of dust swirling into shapes. Micro-setting of the antenna as a recurring object evolves causally, mirroring internal resurrection and pressuring the climax without static repetition. Tone of thistled calm supports the post-famine theme through purposeful contrasts like smoldering spires.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resurrecting stories signals early and deepens via the lyric directions, narrowing options with the broadcast's fade forcing a cloak in everyday clatter, under Accumulative/Textural lens where cadence shift reweights cost. One meaningful intensification at humming to match pitch forecloses silence with visible price of exhaustion. However, pressure feels more poetic than viscerally escalating, with no sharp reversal testing commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of language's survival emerges organically from dust as burned books and pirate fragments, culminating in a resonant final image of silence humming without stated moral, reweighting the famine's premise with conceptual cost. Subtext in implications like dust listening invites reflection on censorship's ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars like children peering at paragraphs, avoiding sentimentality through complex endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable with perceptual signature in Mila's musical bias, like vowels soft as moss, and rhythmic control in lyric compression that teaches patterns early, paying off at closure without obscurity. Voice modulates with pressure via wobbling syllables, and brief dialogue feels natural, subtextual in the pirate's raspy kindness advancing the resurrection. Patterned elision, like elusive lyrics, is voice-motivated and legible under the lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose density is high with sentences like "dust was listening" advancing atmosphere and theme without loops or scaffold, propulsion varying rhythm in static pours and hush releases. Figurative language coheres without muddle, even in peaks, with no template cadence or register drift. Final line resolves by recharging motifs like thistled calm with fertile dawn, zero artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic storytelling via musical copyist and dust as narrative spores feels inevitable, with risk-taking in metaphorical boldness heightening stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes like pirate radio into embedding stories in coughs. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on censorship, committing fully with authenticity in voice and implications. The antenna alignment turn arises from established patterns, not late changes.</comment>
