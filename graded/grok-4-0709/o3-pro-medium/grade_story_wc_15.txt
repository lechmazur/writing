<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Wren's motivation to weave new patterns from broken precedents is clear and intensifies through her optimistic heart, compelling choices like sewing shards into instruments; interiority is concrete via embodied actions like pricking her finger, revealing contradictory impulses in her haunting optimism amid ruins. However, emotions lean toward poetic abstraction rather than raw embodiment, with some stock phrasing in her gull-wing heartbeat. The final renunciation of old precedents earns a meaningful change with felt cost in her blood drop, but flaws feel somewhat performative under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned motifs like orchids and weaving, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Wren's weaving creates a new path, with conceptual cost in transforming ruins to reverence legible in the final breeze. Orientation anchors early at the canyon mouth after tide pools empty. Causality holds via motif accumulation rather than strict linkage, with one meaningful deepening at the loom; however, some elisions feel unmotivated, like sudden ink revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The labyrinth setting is vivid and purposeful, with iron dust, evaporated brine, and fossilized knots constraining Wren's choices and mirroring her weaving craft, charging the final spindle chamber under starlight. Sensory details are selective and POV-biased, evolving causally as walls shift and pulse with orchid light. The recurring tide pool basins function as micro-setting that directly enables her sewing of shards, heightening thematic resonance without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of carving a path from ruin to reverence signals early and tightens once through the shifting labyrinth, forcing Wren's agency in sewing hybrid instruments, with a visible cost in her blood drop under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Pressure coheres via motif density increase, but escalation feels somewhat static, with turns like the downdraft more coincidental than protagonist-driven. One meaningful deepening at the loom narrows options effectively, though moral calculus remains abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of transforming broken precedents into reverence emerges organically from Wren's weaving and the loom's revival, with subtext in phantom orchids and fossilized knots implying solace amid ruin without direct statements. The final image of the new corridor offers a resonant, non-literal answer to navigating loss, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. Emotional aftereffect is honest, avoiding sentimentality through her optimistic yet haunting spirit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with rhythmic control in phrases like "barnacle shells crack like distant clocks," maintaining perceptual signature through Wren's weaver's bias; no dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets. POV is stable single-focalizer, with purposeful compression in dream-paths taught early and paid off at closure. However, dense diction occasionally drifts into overwrought register, muddling clarity under pressure at the spindle.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid images like "petals of phantom orchids," varying rhythm purposefully, but occasional paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated ruin-to-reverence motifs) and mixed metaphors (e.g., gull's wing above silence) dull momentum without payoff. Information density is high, with lines multitasking atmosphere and advancement, and no major artifacts obscure closure. Syntactic variety supports beats, though some template cadence in corridor descriptions repeats stems like "she [verb]s."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise of a poetic weaver mapping a labyrinth with a storybook plate offers fresh synthesis of folklore and optimism, transforming quest tropes through specific motifs like blood-soaked thread and orchid solace, feeling inevitable at the loom revival. Risk-taking in lyric density heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to the vision. However, echoes of mythic journeys feel familiar, though grounded in Wren's craft.</comment>
