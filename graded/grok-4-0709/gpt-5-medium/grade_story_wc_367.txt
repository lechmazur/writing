<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows is clear and intensifies through prophetic laughs and storm interactions, rooted in consistent traits like shadowed elation; interiority is concrete and embodied in moments like sleeping on the stair with ear to optics. The child's presence as a secondary character applies pressure, forcing teaching and protection that alters the narrator's routine with felt cost. However, internal conflicts are more summarized than shown in simultaneous contradictory impulses during key beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images of light, storms, and laughter, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where shadowed elation vows to tomorrow, with conceptual cost of enduring melancholy legible in the final image. Orientation anchors early in the lighthouse post-newspaper era. Closure lands on-page with felt cost, but lacks a more decisive tightening beyond cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse under stars constrains choices, with green glass foundation and lamp room shaping prophetic actions and dreams; recurring objects like the wick and prisms charge the final image of burning absence into direction. Sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, mirroring internal states through tactile coolness and roaring beams.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of steering light amid post-newspaper silence escalates via textural density of storm dialogues and child's arrival, with one meaningful deepening when the ocean delivers the prophetic child, narrowing options to protection and teaching. Cost is felt in weighted joy foreclosing melancholy, but pressure remains more atmospheric than a sharp reversal forcing stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of reshaping information through shadowed elation emerges organically from images like fused silica wicks and storm laughs, offering a resonant non-literal answer to loss of print via lighthouse beams. Subtext in laughter as ballast and final vow invites reflection on endurance without tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, biased noticing of shadows and light; rhythmic control heightens pressure through patterned elision like storm breaths as memory, taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation there.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, high information in metaphors like "thunder grins" advancing atmosphere without loops; figurative language coheres without muddle, even in peak beats like child's arrival. Minor scaffold in repetitive laughter motifs, but they serve pattern without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse as post-print newsroom with prophetic laughs and total internal reflection transforms tropes into non-obvious angle on information's endurance; risk in lyric density heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight via emerald vow.</comment>
