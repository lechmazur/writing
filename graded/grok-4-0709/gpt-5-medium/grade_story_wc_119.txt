<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to transpose life into a new key is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like pocketing the envelope and collaborating with the keeper, revealing contradictory impulses in embracing prophecy while directing flow. Interiority is concrete and embodied in moments like the envelope sweating against ribs, though some phrasing veers toward abstract epiphanies. The keeper's secondary pressure sharpens the narrator's flaws, with status dynamics legible in their shared cigarette-shadow intimacy. Flaws complicate choices without artificial balance, culminating in an earned stasis with felt cost in the unfolding town.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elisions of fortunes and secrets, with orientation anchored early in the harbor after last orders. Causality holds via textural density increases, like the microdots blooming into light-scattered messages, leading to a resonant reconfiguration in the final image of listening to "see what you have done." Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with conceptual cost in the town's unfolded secrets and the agent's ricocheting report. One meaningful cadence shift suffices, though minor ellipsis in the agent's discovery feels slightly unmotivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The harbor and lighthouse settings are vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like neon fizzing out and salt-white boots filtered through the narrator's prophetic bias, constraining choices like walking the causeway at tide-turn. Atmosphere supports the familiar enigma tone, mirroring internal states in the patient lighthouse that grumbles and keeps lists. The rocky island environment charges the final image by evolving causally with the light scattering fortunes, making it indispensable. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, with weather affecting action like the tide thinking things over.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of making open secrets visible escalates through a cadence shift when fortunes are fed to the lighthouse, narrowing options and reweighting cost in the town's unfolding. One meaningful deepening suffices, with agency in the narrator's orchestration forcing stance crystallization without coincidence resolving. Stakes feel visceral in the mercy of "You already know," with a felt price in sticky hands and changed routes. Moral calculus sharpens the choice between hiding and teaching light a new trick, though secondary accents are minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of open secrets emerges organically from images like the envelope and scattered light, inviting reflection on fear quieting without direct statements. Subtext in gestures like the keeper's soundless laugh and sugar-sticky hands enriches complexity, with the final image offering a resonant, non-literal answer by repricing secrecy's cost. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through honest ambiguity, tied to the protagonist's arc of accidental prophecy. No overt moralizing, though one abstract line on orchestrating weather borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature in selective biases like gulls in crosswinds and fortunes blowing back. Voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax that modulates with intensity, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances plot, like the keeper's "Got your fortune" pursuing goals with indirection. No head-hopping or register mismatch, with prose as character reflecting the cryptic mind under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere in lines like "the envelope sweating against ribs" without loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies naturally, with syntactic variety accelerating in the lighthouse scene; metaphors are coherent and purposeful, like "neon fizzed out like a tired constellation." No artifacts obscure closure, though one mixed vehicle ("smudge that looked like a gull or a fingerprint trying to fly") is slightly strained. Opening anchors voice, final line resolves by recharging motifs with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of a prophetic fortune writer using spycraft to illuminate open secrets offers a fresh synthesis of espionage and small-town enigma, feeling inevitable through grounded choices like boiling sugar for microdots. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes like the haunted lighthouse into a patient entity. Originality shines in non-obvious inflections, like fortunes teaching light a new trick, with authenticity avoiding middle-ground hedging. Core elements cohere as a singular vision, elevated by the bold final reconfiguration.</comment>
