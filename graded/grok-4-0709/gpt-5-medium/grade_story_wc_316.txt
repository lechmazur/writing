<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to defeat emotional numbness is concretely embodied through sensory echoes from the jar, culminating in the felt thaw at the joint custody decision; Neri and Rae's distinct traits (soothing vs. sharp) create crucible pressure that reveals the narrator's values. Internal contradictions shine in the narrator's role as witness and decider, with micro-choices like questioning the jar at night showing hierarchy of values. Flaws feel genuine, avoiding stereotypes, though Master Lin remains somewhat archetypal without deeper contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned shards of training and reflection, with legible transitions via motifs like clouds and bells; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration in the joint custody announcement, reweighting the stake with felt cost in the narrator's emotional thaw. Orientation anchors early in the floating rock dojo, avoiding penalties. One meaningful deepening suffices, as the final morning's role-trading tightens to the jar's vibration as consent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo is vividly specific, with clouds passing under and bells tolling from the sky constraining choices in the windroom spar; it charges the final image as statues rearrange into the future, mirroring the reconfiguration. Sensory details like gusts of static to teeth and taste of river stones are purposeful and POV-filtered. Atmosphere supports the theme of rewriting history without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><grade>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of clone custody escalates through pattern breaks in training shards, deepening to the role-trading that forces stance crystallization with the jar's consent as cost. Narrator's agency in announcing joint custody forecloses individual claims, with visible price in unified opposites. Coincidence like history rewriting complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of complementary opposites emerges organically from sparring and the jar's revival, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer at the joint custody that reweights identity without moralizing. Subtext in images like the river child conveys complexity in fear and joy. Avoids thematic echo or sermonizing, inviting reflection through ambiguity in the vivified future.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, sensory-biased noticing, like aches of distant songs; rhythmic control heightens under pressure without elision issues. No head-hopping, and purposeful compression in lyric mode is taught early and pays off at closure. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, free of loops or artifacts; lines like "clouds pass under the sparring floor like slow rivers of breath" advance atmosphere and character simultaneously. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the final announcement. High information density integrates action and image seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ego death, cloning vats, and complementary opposites in a floating dojo feels inevitable, with risk-taking in poetic structure heightening stakes without gimmickry. Transforms sci-fi tropes through specific emotional truth in the narrator's numbness arc. Fresh inflection in the jar's sensory replies reconfigures identity motifs boldly.</comment>
