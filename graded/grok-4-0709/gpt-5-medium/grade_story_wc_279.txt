<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's social perceptiveness drives micro-choices like interjecting with the bearded man, revealing embodied emotion in the "chest veer" and a hierarchy of values with felt cost in the lingering assignment. Interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions layered contradictorily through metaphors like belief as a finger finding seams, avoiding stock phrasing. However, internal conflict feels more accumulative than simultaneous impulses clashing in peak moments, limiting depth under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and deepening hush, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the emergent hush reweights unlearning with undeniable conceptual cost in the final breathing line. Orientation anchors early in the mist-licked grotto, and causality holds via textural density increases like the tile's warming and mandala's distortion. One meaningful cadence shift suffices, but the closure's cost feels more implied than viscerally dramatized on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The grotto setting constrains choices through echoing acoustics and mist, charging the final image of exhaling loops and dusk exit, with sensory details like lilac unease and limestone vividly filtered through POV bias. Micro-setting elements like the tile flake and sand mandala evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Environment pressures the hush's emergence, meeting the 9+ test by constraining the interjection and charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake in discovering meaning tightens through one deepening shift when the tile shifts speaking grooves, narrowing options and forcing stance crystallization under the Accumulative lens, with felt cost in the child's revelation and protagonist's veering chest. Pressure coheres via social currents and mandala rearrangements, but escalation remains subtle without a sharper trade-off. Agency in interjecting drives the turn, yet coincidence in the child's arrival complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of unlearning certainties emerges organically from mandala erasures and hush, resisting tidy morals through ambiguity in mess and patterns, with the final image offering a resonant, non-literal repricing of meaning without stated epiphany. Subtext in silences and tile's echoes enriches complexity, eliciting emotional aftereffect via the carried hush. No overt moralizing, but some abstractions like "ordinary magic" border on direct statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in whimsical, sensory metaphors like mist licking limestone, and rhythmic control heightens under hush without obscuring clarity. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and goal-driven, as in the interjection about laughter shaping the circle, distinguishing voices like the child's tooth question. Patterned elision in poetic compression is taught early and pays off at closure, meeting the 9+ test with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose density is high with purposeful metaphors like "lilac unease" advancing atmosphere and character, varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold, and strong verbs propel momentum. Figurative language integrates without muddle in peak beats like the hush gathering, but occasional overwriting in stacked images slightly dilutes propulsion. No artifacts touch closure, and information density supports the textural lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of chalk art, smuggled tile, and unlearning ritual feels inevitable, transforming tropes like mandala erasure through specific perceptual details and risk-taking in poetic indirection that heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Fresh angle on social perception as "reading crowds by their silences" avoids templates, with the grotto's tooth metaphor a non-obvious inflection. Commits fully to premise without hedging, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
