<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to learn the building's language is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like knocking on the door and pressing the seal, culminating in an earned conceptual shift with felt cost in the final handover. Interiority is concrete and embodied in sensory listening, revealing contradictory impulses between curiosity and reluctance to interrogate. The tutor's enigmatic traits pressure the relationship dynamically, though secondary character depth is limited to atmospheric effect without deeper status shifts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through patterned images of language, lies, and architecture, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the seal's impression reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost in the building's admitted "sentences." Orientation anchors early in the stairwell and hallway, with one smooth transition to the roof. The final image charges prior motifs without causality breaks, and persistent constraints like the seal shape tactics toward revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting details are vivid and purposeful, with the building's stairwell and rooftop garden filtering through POV bias to mirror internal curiosity, constraining choices like the roof meeting that charges the closure. Sensory hierarchy narrows to tactile breaths and meteor light under pressure, evolving causally from hallway teas to night sky. The rooftop environment directly pressures the interrogation and seal use, charging the final image with rosemary prayers and falling stones.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake in learning the building's language tightens through weekly sessions to the roof revelation, with a meaningful deepening in the seal's impression that reweights options via conceptual cost. Pressure accumulates texturally under the lens, forcing stance crystallization in the interrogation without coincidence resolving it. Agency in pressing the seal forecloses ignorance with felt price in the tutor's sigh and departure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of agreed-upon lies emerges organically from images of facades, promises, and sheltered illusions, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the building's confessed sentences that reweight prior material without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like the seal's ritual and meteor watching invites reflection on human-building symbiosis. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complex ambiguity, avoiding sentimentality in the protagonist's un-looked-back departure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in metaphorical noticing, like drafts as syntax, and rhythmic control heightens pressure in the roof scene without elision issues. Dialogue carries subtext and advances revelations naturally, distinguishing voices through the tutor's cheerful admissions and whispers. Prose texture modulates with intensity, using patterned diction purposefully for lyric effect that's taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel accumulative buildup, as in the meteor-thickened sky accelerating revelations without loops or artifacts. Figurative language integrates seamlessly, like ivy "strangling and embracing," enhancing clarity in peak beats. Final line resolves by recharging motifs with precise imagery, free of redundancies or muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes ghostly tutoring and architectural language into a non-obvious exploration of lies as shelter, feeling inevitable through grounded motifs like the seal's ritual. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes of haunted buildings via specific ethical illusions. Fresh inflection in the building's spoken sentences commits fully to implications, avoiding derivative echoes.</comment>
