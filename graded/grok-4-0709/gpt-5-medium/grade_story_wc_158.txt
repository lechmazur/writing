<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The insomniac poet's motivation to transform pain into beauty is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like humming lullabies and signing the treaty, with embodied contradictions in hesitation versus shy persistence. Interiority is concrete via tidal metaphors, avoiding stock phrasing, and the final endurance shows credible change with felt cost of ongoing wakefulness. Flaws like mistaking vigilance for devotion complicate choices authentically, though secondary character pressure from the Gardener feels slightly underdeveloped in status dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, with pattern breaks like the shell opening and vow breathing reweighting stakes via resonant reconfiguration, landing closure on-page with conceptual cost of repriced solitude. Orientation anchors who (poet), where (shell), and when (tidal cycles) by ~120 words, serving the lyric buildup. One meaningful deepening occurs at the meeting, sufficient for length, though causality is more textural than strict linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell anchors vividly with sensory details like drip, creak, and nacre whorls, evolving causally to glow and extrude gardens, constraining choices like ensconcing doubts. Micro-setting of the postcard and pearl dust charges the final image of tending gardens, with tone tensioning dimness into reef-shadow joy. Sensory selection reflects POV bias toward poetic insomnia, integrating into action without stalling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><grade>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, dominant stake of seeking armistice escalates via density increase in imagery and pattern break at the vow, tightening to a meaningful reconfiguration with visible cost of confronting sharpness. One deepening through the Gardener's arrival forces stance crystallization, sufficient for length, with agency in breathing the vow foreclosing solitude. Coincidence of her arrival complicates but does not resolve, maintaining coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of photosynthesizing pain into beauty emerges organically from images like salt to sugar and glowing sorrows, with subtext in dissonant lullabies implying unresolved grief. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting insomnia as gentler waking, embracing complexity without tidy morals. Purposeful ambiguity in reef-shadow joy invites reflection, tied to protagonist's arc without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, tidal filtering, and rhythmic control via fragmented syntax that heightens pressure without obscurity. Patterned elision in lyric mode is taught early and pays off at closure, with no head-hopping. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances plot, like the Gardener's treaty explanation pursuing persuasion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose density is high with multi-job sentences like "converting salt to sugar, insomnia to song," propelling via rhythmic variety and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent, voice-motivated, and avoids muddle in peak beats like the vow. Clarity holds with clean grammar and purposeful fragments, though minor register elevation in "photosynthesize" fits POV without drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of insomnia, shells, and cosmic postcards transforms poetic tropes through specific tidal motives and armistice concept, feeling inevitable with risk in off-key lullabies heightening stakes. Emotional specificity avoids generics, committing to premise without hedging. One fresh inflection in thorns practicing kindness recharges theme organically.</comment>
