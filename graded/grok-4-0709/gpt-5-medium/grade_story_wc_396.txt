<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's calmly intuitive nature is embodied through patient actions like waiting through arguments, revealing contradictory impulses between empathy and urgency in the gathering scene; motivation to map empathy onto action intensifies credibly, culminating in the earned stasis of staying a season with felt cost of shadows lacing tighter.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned reflections and elisions, with orientation anchored early in the lighthouse orchard; closure lands as Charged Poise in the nodding and page-turning floe split, reweighting stakes with conceptual cost of practice as peace, though one minor elision in the vintage store transition slightly softens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard above shifting ice floes constrains choices, with fruit holding small moons and groaning ice mirroring internal doubts; this micro-setting charges the final image of floe splitting like a page turning, evolving causally to pressure the reconciliation without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of stolen light escalates texturally through accusations and shard reflections, tightening once via the proposed map of amends that forces stance crystallization; cost is felt in the weighted breath and guilt as compost, though coincidence of word spreading complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of empathy as practice emerges organically from shard reconstitutions and the child's loss, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in nods "not together and not apart"; final image of mirrors speaking offers resonant, non-literal repricing of anomalies without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person voice maintains distinct perceptual signature through brine-smoke imagery and rhythmic patience, with purposeful compression in reflections taught early; dialogue from Matilde and Harun carries subtext and advances reconciliation, modulating naturally under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose density is high with vivid, multi-job sentences like "floes bit at each other like tired wolves," varying rhythm purposefully; minor synonym loop in "patience made a method" dulls momentum slightly, but no artifacts touch closure, and propulsion accelerates in the gathering scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse orchard with crystal shard and mirrors transforms trope of mediation through non-obvious empathy-mapping, feeling inevitable in the final reconfiguration; risk in lyric elisions heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
