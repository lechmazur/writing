<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation as a translator grafting meaning onto wounds is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like turning the coral during pauses, revealing contradictory impulses of hush and revelation; the boy's shrewd innocence constrains actions with visible cost in the shared anxieties. Interiority is concrete and embodied, avoiding stock phrasing, as in unknotting "weather in other people's chests." Relationships under pressure force a reconfiguration when the mother reaches for the uncle's sleeve, altering their state with felt relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned imagery like coral grooves and smudged notes, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the fog-lowering treaty with conceptual cost of bearable ache; orientation anchors early in the mist-clad atrium at twilight. Closure lands on-page with the coral as lighthouse gift and the boy's future understanding, reweighting prior boats as "we brought ourselves." One meaningful deepening suffices, with persistent coral constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight anchors vividly, with sensory details like vents breathing like surf and rain ticking, filtered through POV bias; the coral as micro-setting constrains choices and charges the final image as a lighthouse gift. Environment evolves causally with mist climbing palms, mirroring internal peace, and supports tone without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of translating shared anxieties for peace tightens once through the stitched script and coral punctuation, deepening via agency in showing the "Also Us" boat, with felt cost in the lotus-hearted ache; under Textural lens, cadence shift reweights stakes without needing multiple reversals. Pressure coheres, forcing stance crystallization when the surgeon's news unclenches the room.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grafting meaning onto wounds emerges organically from images like blurred ink growing clearer and boats labeled "Us" and "Also Us," offering resonant ambiguity without tidy morals; subtext in gestures like the mother's reach and uncle's nod invites reflection on shared weather. Final image of rain folding the night reweights the premise non-literally, embracing complexity in bearable ache.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in oceanic metaphors, modulating rhythm under pressure like testing translations "honest and warm"; purposeful compression in lyric mode teaches patterns early, paying off at closure. Dialogue is minimal but natural, with subtext in traded words for shelter, advancing the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with rhythmic variety in sentences like "mist climbs the hospital palms and the kestrels coil into sleep like commas," avoiding loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent and purposeful, enhancing momentum without muddle in peak beats like stitching the script. High information density advances atmosphere and character simultaneously, with clean grammar and no artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of translator as unknotter of chest-weather transforms conflict-zone tropes through specific coral artifact and child's boats, feeling inevitable with risk in poetic indirection heightening stakes; authenticity coheres in singular vision of pocketed peace, avoiding generics. The non-obvious angle on shared anxieties via smudged cast reconfigures familiar reconciliation boldly.</comment>
