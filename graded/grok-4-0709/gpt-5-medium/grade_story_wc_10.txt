<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to translate silence into music is consistently rooted in the capsize trauma, driving embodied actions like hand-tracing arcs that reveal contradictory impulses of grief and wonder; interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, with flaws like persistent attachment to inert forks complicating choices. The meaningful endurance forecloses drowning in quiet with felt cost, evident in the riverbank reflection that rewrites the algorithm. Single-POV focus excels without needing relationship bullets, but occasional abstract labels like "longing knots" slightly dilute embodiment in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery of frost, light, and heat gradients, culminating in a Charged Poise closure where carrying the case home reconfigures silence as balanced wonder with conceptual cost of ongoing hush. Orientation anchors early in the conservatory, with reflective shards tilting present stance via micro-choices like weighting forks. One meaningful deepening suffices, but minor ellipsis in the first performance's failure feels slightly undermotivated before payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is vividly specific, with ice-limned ferns and glass ribs constraining choices like sensor placement, charging the final image of reciprocal quiet; sensory details like exhaled frost and glowing moth are purposeful, filtered through POV bias toward wonder. Micro-setting of the body and tools like mirrors integrates into action, evolving causally with heat currents. Environment pressures the translation, heightening atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of translating silence escalates through pattern breaks like algorithm rewrites, deepening to reweight endurance with cost of misread emotions; one tightening via riverbank learning forces stance crystallization. Agency in renunciation of sound for light-music forecloses paths with felt price, legible in the old woman's warmed palms. Coincidence of gathered people complicates but doesn't resolve; however, stakes occasionally feel abstract before the moth-cupping inciting moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of finding wonder in silence emerges organically from images like frost staves and heat choirs, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in paradox-living; subtext in gestures like the girl's bird-sign invites reflection on loss and adaptation. The final image of unshaken marvels offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of the hush without statement. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete struggle, like blistering lilies symbolizing misread grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward silent expression in winterlight; voice texture in rhythmic, patterned diction teaches lyric compression early, paying off at closure without obscurity. No dialogue present, so bullets ignored; elision in reflections is purposeful, tilting stance with cues like riverbank pulse. Syntax modulates with intensity, as in conducting arms like masts, maintaining coherence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in arcs like "inhales light and exhales frost" advancing atmosphere without loops; metaphors are coherent and purposeful, like forks as antlers, avoiding muddle in peaks. No artifacts obscure closure, with strong verbs and specific nouns propelling momentum; final line recharges motifs cleanly. Minor synonym churn in early cold descriptions slightly pads, but propulsion remains strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise of heat-mapping emotions in a silent world synthesizes familiar loss tropes into fresh ingenuity via sensor-lattice translation, feeling inevitable with risks like algorithm failure heightening stakes; emotional specificity in remembrance's diffuse warmth transforms conventions. Core elements cohere organically, avoiding echoes, but the ferry backstory borders on stock survival motif without bolder subversion.</comment>
