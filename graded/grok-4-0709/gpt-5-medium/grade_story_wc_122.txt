<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to defeat emotional numbness is clear and intensifies through embodied feelings like "frost beneath the ribs," compelling her choices; interiority is concrete and contradictory, showing fear of numbness while imagining backward songs as a cure. Oko as secondary character applies pressure via his drums and gestures, forging a crucible relationship that alters her state. The final renunciation of numbness is earned with visible cost in her trembling fingers and thawed chest. Voice distinction holds in Mara's perceptual idiom of feeling over hearing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images of hush and reversal, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara mends the needle and feels music return, reweighting her numbness with felt cost in the "tide unwinding." Orientation anchors early in the cavern during turning seasons. Closure lands on-page with conceptual repricing of silence as presence, though some elliptical jumps mildly soften causality without breaking the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cavern setting is vivid and purposeful, with basalt swallowing sound and smells of smoke mirroring Mara's internal hush; it constrains choices by amplifying reversed music inward. Sensory details like hanging hides and dry leaves evolve with action, charging the final image of the road unscrolling like vinyl. Environment charges the closure by revealing a "harbor of not-sound," satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of defeating numbness signals early and deepens through the rigging of needle to drum, narrowing options via backward songs that coax feelings to surface; under Accumulative/Textural lens, cadence shift reweights with felt cost in thawed frost. One meaningful tightening suffices, driven by agency in stitching the filament. Coincidence of finding Oko complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence as a pathway to feeling emerges organically from images like the filament of hush and reversed beats, inviting reflection on numbness without tidy morals; the final image of hush as presence offers a resonant, non-literal answer to emotional thawing. Subtext in gestures and implications deepens complexity. Earned insight arises from the cavern experience, avoiding platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward tactile feeling over sound, as in reading palms like lips; prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, metaphorical syntax that modulates with intensity. Patterned elision in lyric mode is taught early and pays off at closure. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; elision is purposeful and legible under the lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "shadows of hides hung like moons," but occasional overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., "flame guttered... lighthouse at fog's edge") mildly muddles clarity in peak beats without obscuring closure. Rhythm varies naturally, with strong verbs and specificity; no major loops or artifacts touch the ending. Information propulsion holds, though some figurative muddle deducts slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deafness, backward music, and hush as filament transforms tropes of sensory loss into a non-obvious angle on emotional revival; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with bold metaphorical risks cohering as singular vision. No derivative echoes; ingenuity in reversed songs redefining rhythm.</comment>
