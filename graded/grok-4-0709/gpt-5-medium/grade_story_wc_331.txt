<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to find the stories' origin is rooted in personal loss and intensifies through micro-choices like reciting theorems, revealing contradictory impulses between solitude and connection. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with emotions like the scarf's ozone scent tying to flawed, eccentric traits that complicate the journey. The ending's renunciation carries a felt cost, as the narrator returns without full discovery but with tidal evidence in pockets, earning stasis through prior buildup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and cadence shifts, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the narrator sees the stories' weather but not their place, reweighting the quest with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors early in the library shift, with deliberate disorientation in the hyperbolic path serving closure by charging the return. One meaningful deepening occurs as shelves curve into new alignments, narrowing options without requiring causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library setting constrains choices through curved shelves and hyperbolic navigation, directly shaping the narrator's path and charging the final image of snow from the scarf as letters on patrons. Sensory details like ozone-scented scarf and salty air are selective, POV-biased, and evolve causally, mirroring internal solitude. Micro-setting of the saddle space and meteorite desk integrates action, with environmental evolution heightening thematic resonance without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of finding stories' origin tightens through a single deepening in the curved aisle, reweighting options with the cost of incomplete discovery yet gained insight. Pressure coheres via internal friction between want and hyperbolic method, culminating in Charged Poise as the narrator returns with tidal evidence. Coherent buildup forces stance crystallization without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of tending memories amid infinities emerges organically from images like curving shelves and salt-to-snow, resisting tidy morals by embracing ambiguity in the unfound place. Subtext in gestures like the boy's napkin and woman's margin note invites reflection on curved lives. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer, repricing memory's weight without stated epiphany.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, eccentric idiom, modulating rhythm under pressure like sharpened air and theorem recitals. Patterned elision in lyric mode is taught early and pays off at closure with legible reconfiguration. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; free indirect style integrates thought cleanly without filter stacks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose density is high with rhythmic variety, as in "shelves curve like coastlines," advancing atmosphere and character without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled, voice-motivated, and clear in peak beats like the map unrolling as endings' distribution. No artifacts obscure closure; sentences propel through purposeful syntax, with final line recharging motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes scientific poetry with hyperbolic navigation in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming library tropes through eccentric shelving and memory weather. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable as the scarf's salt becomes snow. Emotional specificity in solitude avoids generics, committing to the vision organically.</comment>
