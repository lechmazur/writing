<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivations are clear and rooted in fears cataloged like injuries, with interiority embodied in trembling hands and breath counts during decryption, showing contradictory impulses under pressure. However, some emotions lean toward therapy-speak, like "transformative betrayal," slightly abstracting the internal conflict. The final endurance forecloses isolation with felt relational cost, earned by prior micro-choices like climbing the ladder despite phobias.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned revelations and metaphors, with orientation anchored early in the rusted library under stars. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration via the brothers' shared unlocking of names, with conceptual cost in reknitting identity evident in the line "My breath broke with the sentence, then reknit." One meaningful deepening suffices, though some reflective blocks summarize without fully tilting present stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars is vividly sensory, with groaning iron stacks and skylight constraining choices like tracing smears and climbing to the roof. Details filter through POV bias, mirroring internal rust and transformation, and the setting pressures the climax by hiding the box and brother. The recurring cast as micro-setting charges the final image with new notes traced together.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><grade>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of proving vulnerability as power tightens through decryption's density increase, narrowing options with each guessed letter and shell hum. One deepening via the box opening forces stance crystallization with felt cost in "My breath broke," though coincidence of the child's cast complicates without fully resolving. Agency in climbing and speaking names earns the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability as power emerges organically from decryption and reunion, with subtext in whispers and smears implying hidden strengths. The final image of braiding terror and trust offers resonant repricing without moralizing, reweighting betrayal as a hinge. Some direct statements like "I wanted to prove that vulnerability is power" border on assertion, slightly reducing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The first-person POV is stable with a distinct poetic texture in rhythmic syntax like "memory scraping against sky," modulating under stress without head-hopping. Perceptual signature biases toward fears and stunts, with purposeful compression in reflections taught early. Non-standard grammar feels voice-motivated and legible, enhancing the trembling certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purposeful metaphors like "groaned like ships," advancing atmosphere, but occasional loops like repeated "I" stems in reflective blocks dull momentum. Rhythm varies naturally, though some figurative muddle in peak beats, such as overlapping whispers, slightly obscures clarity without harming closure. High information density propels to the resonant ending line "This is who I am, finally, and I will endure."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise of a stunt double discovering a swapped life offers fresh synthesis on identity, transformed through codes on a child's cast and vulnerability's power. Risk in poetic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the roof reunion. Avoids tropes by grounding in specific fears and adaptive traits.</comment>
