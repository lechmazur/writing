<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to seek the mathematics of mercy is clear and intensifies through embodied trauma responses, compelling choices like knotting the strap as a boundary; interiority is concrete with contradictory impulses in reflections on pain and remorse, though some emotions lean toward abstract labels like "displaced but rooted."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and reflections to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the protagonist internalizes the forest's lesson, with felt conceptual cost in the etched rule and refusal to exceed limits; orientation anchors early in the ultraviolet forest post-anesthesia, and causality holds via pattern breaks like the path brightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is vividly sensory and purposeful, with fluorescing leaves and cobalt fire constraining choices and charging the final path; it mirrors internal remorse through veined trunks, and the micro-setting of the body under proprioception enhances specificity without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering mercy's math escalates through accumulative pressure of trauma memories and forest equations, deepening to a meaningful cadence shift in the theorem offering; cost is legible in the soul-fracture ratio and boundary knot, though coincidence in the caretaker's appearance slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of calibrating mercy amid trauma emerges organically from images like glowing scars and equations, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the internalized forest; subtext in gestures like knotting the strap invites reflection on penance without moralizing, embracing complexity in the protagonist's flawed endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in sensory ultraviolet details, and rhythmic prose modulates with pressure; purposeful compression in lyric mode teaches patterns early, paying off at closure without obscurity, though minor register drift into academic terms like "proprioceptively enhanced" feels slightly unmotivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm and high information in metaphors like "ultraviolet penance," advancing atmosphere; however, some overwriting in stacked figuratives like "symbols rise like gnats" creates minor muddle in peak beats, and a paraphrase loop in remembrance sections dulls momentum slightly without harming closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sci-fi enhancement with surreal forest penance transforms familiar trauma tropes through specific details like trauma-response memory plucking, feeling inevitable; bold risk in lyric structure heightens stakes organically, with fresh inflection in the mathematics of mercy reweighting the premise without gimmickry.</comment>
