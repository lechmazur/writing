<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to understand thresholds and find the father is clear and intensifies through reflective micro-choices, like aligning codes with wood grain, revealing embodied emotions in the ache of distance; interiority is concrete via featherly determination, but some emotions feel performed rather than contradictory in scene, as in the calm distrust summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of mazes, codes, and thresholds to a Conceptual Repricing closure where distance becomes a companion with felt ache as cost; orientation anchors early in the drifting terrace despite surrealism, serving the lyric payoff without penalty; one meaningful deepening suffices, but causality feels elliptical in the father's vanishing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices like pressing the seam to reveal shadows, with sensory details like sugar glass wind filtered through POV bias; it charges the final image of measured steps, qualifying as micro-setting that evolves causally; tone tensions the fractured hush effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering sacred thresholds escalates texturally through code-wood alignments, deepening to a stance crystallization with the ache as cost; one tightening via the seam press narrows options under the lens, but pressure feels abstract without a sharper reversal testing commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of necessary distances emerges organically from images like mazes and whispers, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer that reweights love needing space like wind a fence; subtext in silences and implications enriches without direct statements, inviting reflection through ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic noticing, like sap knots as storm grammar; rhythmic control heightens in pressured moments without obscurity, and patterned elision teaches early, paying off at closure; no dialogue, so policy skips those bullets.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in metaphors like terrace as raft without loops or scaffold; figurative language coheres without muddle, but occasional overwriting in peak beats like code alignments slightly dulls propulsion; final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weather codes, wood grain, and thresholds transforms maze tropes through specific emotional complexity, feeling inevitable in the distance-as-companion reconfiguration; risk in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, earning +0.3 adjustment.</comment>
