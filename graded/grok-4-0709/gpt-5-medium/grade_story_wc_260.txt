<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied emotions and contradictory impulses, as the narrator's shaking hands and murmured assurances reveal internal conflict between precision and rage; motivation intensifies compellingly to the final renunciation of vanity, earning the stasis with visible cost in the letter to donors; flaws like credulity complicate choices without hedging, and micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, culminating in the tail tip as a relic of belief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned imagery like mist and stars toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final stillness, with conceptual cost legible in reweighted beliefs; orientation anchors early in the workshop scene, and one meaningful deepening tightens via the surgical cut; however, some reflective blocks slightly exceed BRR allowance without fully tilting present stance, mildly softening causality at midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting vividly anchors in the misty workshop under stars, with sensory details like lantern light and atomizer mist filtered through POV bias; environment constrains choices, as the terrarium's removal of fake elements charges the reconstructive act and final image; details evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism, and micro-setting of tools like forceps heightens pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconstructing trust escalates texturally through density increase in reflective inventory and the surgical deepening, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in eroded donor faith; one meaningful tightening via the cut narrows options, earning the poise; pressure coheres under lens but lacks a secondary accent for fuller intensification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fragile convictions emerges organically from shedding layers and balancing respect/compassion, with subtext in images like the tail tip as omened seed; final image offers resonant, non-literal repricing of beliefs without moralizing; emotional honesty avoids sentimentality, inviting reflection through ambiguity in the chameleon's indifference.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in poetic, mist-infused voice with rhythmic control, as syntax breathes with emotional intensity like "The mist lay thin as breath"; purposeful compression and elision taught early pay off at closure; no dialogue, so policy skips those bullets, but interior voice remains coherent and specific under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with vivid metaphors like "green shifting to brown with worry" advancing atmosphere without muddle; zero loops or scaffold, but occasional figurative stacking in peak beats slightly drifts register, as in the broker's "quietly vivid" speeches; rhythm varies naturally, supporting momentum to the shimmering close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wildlife surgery and financial con aftermath feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like the branded thermometer; risk in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise with authentic vision; one fresh inflection in the relics on the shelf recharges theme organically.</comment>
