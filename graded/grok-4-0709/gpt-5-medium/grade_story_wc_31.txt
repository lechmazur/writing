<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to discover the color of sound is clear and intensifies through embodied actions like diving and reading vows, revealing contradictory impulses in not being superstitious yet hiding behind truth. Interiority is concrete, with emotions embodied in the hum's tint and the vow's binding cost. The final endurance of attention forecloses casual observation with a felt cost, shown in the silver carried upward.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered imagery and pattern shifts, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the color of sound is realized with the conceptual cost of bound attention. Orientation anchors early in the pier and harbor, with no disorientation debt. Closure lands on-page with the vow and surfacing, reweighting the lanterns as notes, though causality feels more poetic than strictly motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sunken ship's library is vividly specific, with kelp curtains and glowing books constraining the protagonist's wandering and charging the final image of ash as saved sentences. Sensory details like wet timbered bells and nacre light are purposeful, filtered through POV bias. The setting pressures choices, such as brushing books to wake lettering, and evolves causally with tide sighs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake of discovering sound's color tightens through the dive and library interaction, with a meaningful deepening when the vow tints the hum silver, narrowing options to earned patience. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates via shadows as birds and ash snow, forcing stance crystallization. Cost is legible in the binding vow's foreclosure of tiring, though coincidence in finding the twin tag slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of listening and patience emerges organically from vows and the library's glow, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in sound's thawing silver. Subtext in images like temporary birds and erased breath invites reflection on availability without begging. The final image of lanterns as notes offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the color quest, reweighting the premise without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in metaphors like algae remembering lightning, modulating rhythm under pressure like the tethered metronome. Prose texture is purposeful, with patterned diction teaching lyric compression early and paying off at closure. No dialogue present, so no evaluation needed; elision of surface details heightens immersion without confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with vivid metaphors like moonlight nicked by old knives advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the dive and breathing in realizations, though some stacked figuratives in the library beat risk muddle but maintain clarity. Information density is high, with lines multitasking image and theme; no artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The premise of underwater vows and sound's color synthesizes poetic elements into a non-obvious, inevitable whole, transforming tropes like sunken treasures through specific risks like the binding vow. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, as in the meteor hush tone. Authenticity coheres in the singular vision of lamplighting as attention, avoiding derivatives.</comment>
