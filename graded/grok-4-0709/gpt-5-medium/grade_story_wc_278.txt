<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is deeply rooted in guilt over abandoning a child, compelling choices like tattooing the glyph, with embodied emotions shown through throat-remembered cold and pulse-crossing ink; internal conflict layers contradictory impulses, as in pretending maps are forward while hushing dissonance. However, reflections occasionally summarize rather than dramatize flaws under pressure, slightly softening peak embodiment. The final self-tattoo earns stasis by foreclosing escape, with visible cost in unforgiven inward mapping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, patterns of cries, letters, and glyphs build density toward a resonant reconfiguration in the self-tattoo, reweighting guilt with conceptual cost; orientation anchors early in the lab setting. Closure lands as Earned Stasis with felt cost in the thinning sound and ongoing listening, shaped by persistent guilt constraint. Minor elision in backstory payoff holds without breaking pattern coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds is vividly specific, with salvaged boards and humming speakers constraining choices, like the floor listening back to charge discoveries; sensory details, biased through the protagonist's tuned ear, mirror internal hush via meteor-like dust pauses. The amber object recurs to charge the final image, constraining the choice to stay. Atmosphere evolves causally, supporting theme without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of hushing guilt escalates texturally through pattern breaks like the recorder's cry translation and letter directives, deepening to force the self-tattoo stance; one meaningful intensification suffices, with felt cost in unforgiven endurance. Agency via renunciation forecloses escape, though coincidence of the woman's arrival complicates without resolving. Moral calculus sharpens via competing holds and releases, charging the inward map.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of translating and tethering lost sounds to hush guilt emerges organically from images like tethered stars and amber's hold, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in unforgiven thinning; subtext in silences and implications, like the insect's flex, invites reflection. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by repricing guilt's waveform. Emotional aftereffect lingers through concrete particulars without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in meteor hush and ghosted frequencies, modulating rhythm under pressure like stuttering translations; patterned elision in lyric mode is taught early and pays off at closure. Prose texture via syntax and diction reflects the focalizer's mind, with purposeful compression heightening hush. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "dusk that unspools like tape"; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops, with strong verbs and specific nouns propelling beats. Figurative language integrates without muddle, as in "guilt lives in waveforms," serving voice without overwriting. Minor scaffold in one reflective paraphrase, but closure image remains sharp and propelled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes tattooing constellations with haunted translations in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming tropes of guilt via specific glyph and firmware motifs; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in waveform guilt feels inevitable, committing to implications like inward maps. Bold synthesis elevates, with no close echoes of familiar scenes.</comment>
