<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to preserve lost songs after betrayal is clear and intensifies through contradictory impulses of doubt and hope, culminating in an earned renunciation of suspicion with visible emotional cost in the attic's thinning. Interiority is concrete and embodied, as in the "hinge loosen where suspicion had rusted it shut," revealing character under pressure without stock phrasing. Flaws like guardedness complicate choices authentically, though secondary characters like the violinist apply pressure more symbolically than directly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with patterned elision and motif buildup (dust motes, pigeons, songs) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final echo climbing back "soft as flour, strong as rope," reweighting trust with conceptual cost of unfolding history. Orientation anchors early in the attic at noon, serving closure without disorientation debt. Closure lands on-page with felt cost, though one micro-turn (attic clearing) could tighten causality further for causal-hybrid lean.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The vintage bookshop attic is vividly anchored with sensory specificity like "dust sweet" and "glue and cedar," constraining choices through the skylight's motes that map winds and charge the final image of Lark lifting in gentle drift. Micro-setting elements like the beam and latch evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Environment pressures tactics, as the thinning attic forces hurried copying and trust's blooming-withering tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of learning to trust tightens meaningfully through the attic clearing and winter exchanges, deepening via agency in sending the pigeon choir, with legible emotional cost in loosening suspicion's rust. Under Accumulative lens, pattern break in the gust and latch repair crystallizes stance without coincidence resolving. One reversal narrows options authentically, though internal conflict could interweave more externally for higher escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of reinvention and trust emerges organically from motifs like paper trails and lost songs, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer where history "unfolds and refolds" with gentler creases, embracing complexity without tidy morals. Subtext in gestures like trading scraps and the meteorite's calibration invites reflection on betrayal's cost. Final image reweights the premise with emotional honesty, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in lyric compression, like "dust motes under a single skylight," teaching patterned elision early and paying off at closure without obscurity. Prose texture modulates rhythm purposefully under pressure, with non-standard punctuation voice-motivated and legible. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; focalization stays character-bound with biased noticing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density and propulsion with vivid, multi-job sentences like "the echo climbs the drainpipes back to me, soft as flour, strong as rope," varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the hatch opening. Zero artifacts touch closure, with strong verbs and specific detail enhancing momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of pigeon training, Mars meteorite, and musical trust in a bookshop attic transforms familiar betrayal tropes through specific, non-obvious details like mapping dust motes, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise's implications. Emotional specificity avoids generics, though proximity to poetic archetypes slightly tempers freshness.</comment>
