<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to cradle empathy in steel arms is clear and intensifies through contradictory impulses of warmth and coldness, compelling the renaming choices with felt cost in the climax. Interiority is concrete and embodied, showing internal conflict in scene, such as the undecided heart and aberrant mercy. Secondary characters like the boy and men apply immediate pressure, forcing micro-choices that reveal values with visible trade-offs. The single-POV focus excels without needing status dynamics for absent dialogue-heavy interactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and motifs like ash and tessera, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final loosening of the past with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors who (narrator), where (ancient plaza), and when (after the great fire) by ~50 words, serving the lyric payoff without penalty. Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis, reweighting mercy's implications via the renaming sequence. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length, with coherent pressure holding through the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plaza beneath a shattered sky is vividly specific, with ash halos and broken columns constraining choices and charging the final image of placing the tessera back, meeting the 9+ test. Sensory details are selective and POV-biased, mirroring internal warm coldness through wind like a surgeon and shadows on wrists. Setting evolves causally, pressuring the renaming ritual without static repetition. Atmosphere supports the merciful tone, integrating into action like scattering caps on the stepping stone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of aberrant mercy escalates through pattern breaks in the renaming of Asha to Sila and the men's new roles, reweighting harm with repair via one meaningful deepening. Pressure coheres, forcing stance crystallization in resisting easy verdicts, with felt cost in the plaza's tightening and the men's bowed heads. Agency via renunciation of vengeance forecloses punitive paths, though coincidence in the boy's info complicates without resolving. Moral calculus sharpens the climax between grief and harm, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of renaming without forgetting emerges organically from concrete events like the tessera arrangement and men's new tasks, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in mercy's difficulty. Subtext in images like the scar as a pale river and bottle caps' patterns invites reflection on empathy's cost. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to balancing harm and repair, reweighting the premise without statement. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through complex, flawed mercy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic noticing, like retrocognitive fog and stone grammar, holding under pressure without head-hopping. Voice texture is purposeful with rhythmic syntax and patterned diction, teaching lyric compression early and paying off at closure. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances plot, as in the boy's careful breath and the plaza's whisper. No elision obscures; psychic distance shifts intentionally with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, high information density in metaphors like song climbing a throat, and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the renaming ritual. Clarity shines in concise, multi-job sentences, with strong verbs and specific nouns enhancing momentum. Opening anchors voice; final line recharges motifs with the past loosening, meeting the 9+ test zero artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise of retrocognitive renaming in a shattered plaza offers fresh synthesis of mercy and radical gentleness, feeling inevitable through steel arms and chipped patterns. Tropes of post-disaster redemption are transformed via specific choices like bottle-cap divination and non-absolving names. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, cohering as a singular vision. No derivative echoes; emotional specificity anchors universality.</comment>
