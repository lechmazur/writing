<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The keeper's motivation to protect safety through anonymous letters and stones is concrete and intensifies with the storm and haunting, revealing contradictory impulses like preferring the haunted room despite claiming otherwise; the skipper's reticent observation applies subtle pressure, making relationships a crucible for the keeper's endurance. Interiority is embodied in the "luminescent ache" that shines to guide, with flaws like isolation complicating choices without hedging. The final renunciation of forgetting the previous keeper earns stasis with felt cost in the shell addition to stones.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of letters, stones, and ghosts toward a Conceptual Repricing in the final dawn reflection, reweighting safety as an ache with undeniable conceptual cost; orientation anchors early in the lighthouse room post-lamp failure. Closure lands as Charged Poise with the "Thank you" note and stones, reconfiguring the premise of guardianship. One meaningful cadence shift in the skipper's visit deepens the stake without requiring causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room constrains choices, pressuring the keeper's reflections and actions like lighting the candle and finding sea glass, charging the final image of stones in moonlight; sensory details like fog-swirled glass and candle smoke are selective, POV-biased toward safety and loss. Atmosphere evolves with the storm to dawn, mirroring internal ache without overt symbolism. Micro-setting of the pedestal and sill integrates into action, guiding the thematic hush after weather.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of bottling safety escalates texturally through the lamp's failure and haunting, deepening via the skipper's visit and letter exchange, reweighting options with the cost of ongoing ache; one tightening in pressing sea glass and hearing footsteps forces stance crystallization on endurance. Pressure coheres under the Textural lens without needing multiple reversals. The final stones foreclose forgetting with felt emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of safety as a luminescent ache emerges organically from letters, stones, and hauntings, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the ghosts' kindness; the final image of stones in moonlight offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of loss as guidance. Subtext in silences and implications, like the skipper's glance, invites reflection on unseen connections. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars like the child's soup confession.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with perceptual signature in poetic, selective noticing like "fog swirled like breath around a sleeping child"; voice texture in rhythmic, image-dense syntax holds under pressure, teaching patterned elision early for legibility. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and subtextual, like "They are" about hauntings, advancing the exchange without declaration. No head-hopping or register drift; psychic distance shifts intentionally with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and theme through vivid images like "wings brushed the glass"; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops or scaffold, with syntactic variety supporting propulsion. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, like sea glass "worn thin by years of being almost broken," without muddle in peak beats. No artifacts obscure closure; final line resolves with resonant cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse guardianship with anonymous chains and stone messages transforms tropes of isolation into a non-obvious network of unseen safety; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in the ache avoids generics, committing to the premise's implications. The sea glass as "small green lighthouse inside" offers ingenious reconfiguration.</comment>
