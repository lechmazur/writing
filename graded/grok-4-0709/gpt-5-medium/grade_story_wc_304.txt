<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to honor her mentor through ritual is clear and intensifies via embodied grief, with interiority showing contradictory calm and sorrow in lines like "unshaken and remade." Flaws complicate choices authentically, as her recalibration defies guild norms, earning the final renunciation with felt cost. Minor stock phrasing in emotional descriptions slightly dilutes specificity, but micro-choices under pressure reveal values effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural, held through pattern-building echoes like static and aurora that reweight the stake. Orientation anchors early in the grotto under aurora; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise in "I knew I had captured one last spark," with conceptual cost of preserved memory amid loss. Persistent constraint of the chip's limits shapes tactics, paying off with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto under aurora is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "green fire into the grotto's stone ribs" constraining choices and charging the final image of paling light. Micro-setting of the bier and kit integrates into action, reflecting POV bias toward thresholds. Environment evolves causally, mirroring internal hush without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of capturing the spark tightens through ritual deepening, narrowing options as the chip dims, forcing stance crystallization under textural lens. Agency in anointing and tuning drives escalation with felt cost in the mentor's echoed voice, reweighting grief. Coherent pressure from aurora and static builds to closure without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of grace in grief emerges organically from images like "threading constellations from snow," culminating in a resonant non Angled non-literal answer to the central question. Final image offers non-literal reconfiguration of grief without moralizing. Subtext in silence and implication deepens complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, selective noticing like "static rose like blown salt." Prose texture modulates rhythm under pressure, with purposeful compression in lyric mode taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue, but internal voice coherence heightens emotional beats without filter-verb excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in lines like "the aurora draped its living veils," advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the chip's "green bruise." Clarity and concision shine in multi-job sentences, with strong verbs and specific detail enhancing momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mortuary art, sci-fi chip, and auroral mysticism transforms tropes through specific worldview, feeling inevitable in the "whisper-engine" reprise. Risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise with authentic complexity. Non-obvious angle on thresholds avoids stock grief arcs.</comment>
