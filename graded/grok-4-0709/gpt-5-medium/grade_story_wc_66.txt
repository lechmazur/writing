<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to revive stories from dust is consistent and intensifies through diligent copying, rooted in traits like measured devotion, with embodied emotions in actions like tapping the pencil; however, interior contradictions are more implied than simultaneous in scene, slightly softening peak pressure. The final promise represents a credible endurance with felt cost of ongoing vigilance. Quick test passed with earned renunciation tied to prior accumulation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of dust and silence toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the coda's promise and cadence marker, with conceptual cost of perpetual listening legible in the final dream; orientation anchors early in the ember alcove. One meaningful cadence shift suffices, holding the lens without contradiction. Cost proof: the ribs' marker and swept floor image make the before/after reconfiguration undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ember alcove in mist is vividly specific, with sensory details like needle-snow and thistled calm filtered through POV bias, constraining choices like cloaking the glow and charging the final image of warming floors. Micro-setting of the radio and ash evolves causally, mirroring internal revival without overt symbolism. Quick test met as the alcove pressures the listening and shapes closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of teaching dust to tell stories escalates via accumulative density in the broadcast's verses, with one meaningful deepening when Cinder engages, narrowing options to a promise with visible cost of carrying tempo forward. Pressure coheres under Textural lens, forcing stance crystallization without coincidence resolving. Quick test passed with agency in tapping and copying driving the intensification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming narrative from silence emerges organically through recurring images of ash vowels and dust phrases, culminating in a resonant, non-literal coda that reweights the famine's absence without moralizing. Subtext in silences and moths' annotations invites reflection on loss and diligence. Quick test satisfied as the final image offers a complex answer to storytelling's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic noticing of thistle fluff and soot grammar, syntax rhythmic and voice-motivated in lyric compression. Patterned elision in broadcast's sideways voice is taught early and pays off at closure. No dialogue, so policy skips; quick test met with rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, high information in lines like "lines fell like sawdust," free of loops or artifacts; metaphors cohere without muddle, advancing atmosphere and character. Clarity holds in peak beats like the broadcast's arrival. Quick test cleared with zero scaffold and controlled density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-famine world with pirate broadcasts and dust notation transforms tropes of loss into a fresh angle on narrative revival, with risk in lyric structure heightening stakes organically. Core premise feels inevitable through particulars like Cinder's kiln. Quick test passed with non-obvious ingenuity charging the reconfiguration.</comment>
