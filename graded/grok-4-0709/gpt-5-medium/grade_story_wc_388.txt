<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to excavate truth is clear and intensifies through discoveries, with interiority embodied in actions like reassembling shreds, revealing contradictory impulses between skepticism and tenderness in keeping the love note. Flaws complicate choices without hedging, as imperfection is embraced in the diamond's utility. The final refusal of the diamond earns stasis by foreclosing enrichment with a felt cost of steadiness over mystery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure builds through motivated discoveries with because/therefore linkages, from storm observation to reconstruction, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where truth reweights myth with conceptual cost in the director's liability line. Orientation anchors early in the orchard entry. One meaningful tightening suffices, with the shredder find as a pivotal turn narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard is vividly specific, with radioactive dust storms constraining choices like camping in the office, and the packing shed charging the final image under the diamond's hum. Sensory details filter through POV bias, mirroring internal calm amid chaos. Environment evolves causally, pressuring the investigation without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth vs. myth escalates causally through the storm and shred reconstruction, tightening to a deepening that reweights options with the liability revelation's cost. Agency in teaching caretakers crystallizes stance, though coincidence of the shredder find complicates without resolving. Moral calculus sharpens the peak, but cost feels more conceptual than visceral in the dream sequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth as irrigation over sermon emerges organically from discoveries, with subtext in the diamond's hum and love note, inviting reflection on imperfection's utility without tidy morals. The final image of walking out reweights the premise non-literally, embracing ambiguity in caretakers' mixed reactions. Emotional aftereffect lingers through tenderness surviving bureaucracy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in sharp observations like the cone of calm, and rhythmic control heightens pressure in storm descriptions without elision issues. Prose texture modulates with intensity, using purposeful compression in reflections that tilt stance. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; reliability accrues through consistent skepticism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in metaphors like "herd of hammers" that advance atmosphere without muddle, and zero loops or scaffolds in peak beats like the reconstruction. Strong verbs and specific nouns propel momentum, with final line recharging motifs effectively. Minor figurative density in storm scene breathes with purpose, avoiding overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic sci-fi with debunking transforms tropes through specific details like the resonator's frequency, feeling inevitable in the liability justification. Risk in lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to the premise's implications. Emotional specificity in the love note avoids generics, offering a non-obvious angle on survival and truth.</comment>
