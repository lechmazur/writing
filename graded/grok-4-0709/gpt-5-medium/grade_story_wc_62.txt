<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation as a gravestone carver rooted in discovering collective grief is consistent and intensifies through meditative carving, with interiority embodied in poetic but specific reflections like measuring breath with the ribbon. Internal conflict shows in balancing ornament and silence, guided by spectral mentorship, leading to an earned endurance that forecloses haste with felt emotional cost. The father's presence as a secondary character applies pressure, forcing a shared poem-trading moment that alters the carving's pacing. However, emotions occasionally lean toward abstract labels like "thundering calm" without deeper contradictory embodiment in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and motifs like butterflies and poems, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where finishing the stone reprices grief as migratory movement with conceptual cost in the final kite curve. Orientation anchors early in the greenhouse at dusk, with causality in motif accumulation rather than linear turns. One meaningful deepening occurs as the father's visit tightens the stake, leading to shared closure. Minor elision in mother's spectral visits is patterned and pays off without breaking coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse at dusk is vividly anchored with sensory details like glass ribs singing and condensation planets, selectively filtered through the carver's meditative POV. Setting constrains choices, as the lettuce beds steady the father and vents deliver spectral drafts, charging the final image of the kite curve. Atmosphere evolves with the migration, mirroring grief's rings, and micro-details like soil holding the day integrate action. No white-room issues; environment pressures the work without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake in shaping collective grief escalates texturally through motif density, with one meaningful deepening when the father chooses a poem notch, narrowing options and forcing a trade-off in carving depth with emotional cost. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, crystallizing in the final stone completion without coincidence resolving it. Agency in renunciation of ornament forecloses paths, though secondary stakes like migration feel accentual rather than braided. Cost is legible in the father's steadied breath and the quilt-like unfinished quality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of grief as migratory movement emerges organically from images like butterflies and widening rings, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in spectral guidance. Subtext in silences and poem notches invites reflection on collective loss, culminating in a resonant final image repricing grief without statement. Emotional aftereffect builds from particulars like the kite poem, avoiding sentimentality. Minor drift in abstract assertions like "meaning learns to sit" slightly dilutes complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct poetic texture in syntax and rhythm, like "glass ribs singing like tide," modulating with intensity and teaching patterned compression early. Perceptual signature is character-specific, biased toward meditative hush and tool interactions. Dialogue with the father feels natural, subtextual, and advances the stake via poem-trading. No head-hopping; elisions in spectral visits are paid off at closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in poetic lines like "butterflies tested the cracked roof," advancing atmosphere without loops. Figurative language is controlled, though occasional mixed metaphors like "thundering calm" border on muddle but pay off in tone. No artifacts obscure closure; sentences propel via strong verbs and specificity. Minor scaffold in repetitive hush motifs is purposeful and pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of gravestone carving with spectral mentorship and poem-ribbon measuring offers a fresh angle on grief, transforming tropes through specific motifs like butterfly migration. Risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the kite curve. Emotional specificity avoids generics, though proximity to poetic elegy echoes slightly tempers novelty. Core premise commits fully, with ingenuity in grief as "widening rings."</comment>
