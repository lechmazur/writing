<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to weave truth carefully drives consistent, high-stakes choices like inviting dreamers to listen, rooted in traits of patience and empathy; interiority is concrete and embodied, as in feeling Sofia's rhythm in palms during the dive. Internal conflict shows through reluctance to shout accusations, balancing impulses for justice and healing with visible cost in the quiet non-cheer at exposure. Flaws like caution complicate the resolution without hedging, earning stasis through gentle confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, patterns of tapping and rhythms build density toward a resonant reconfiguration in the shrine's final watching, with conceptual cost of healed wounds legible in the resting globe. Orientation anchors early in the dive and shrine, teaching the poetic pattern without disorientation. Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise, reweighting truth's exposure with undeniable pressure from the foreman's lowered eyes and husband's quiet turning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The candle-lit shrine in glacier ice constrains choices, like cutting portholes for connection, and charges the final image of the globe shining in borrowed starlight. Sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, with silt and currents mirroring memory's movement; the micro-setting of the ferry's ribs evolves causally during the dive, guiding discovery without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of exposing truth tightens through the dive's deepening rhythm and globe's revelation, narrowing options to gentle invitation over shouting, with felt cost in the foreman's swallowing and non-cheering resolution. Under Accumulative lens, cadence shifts reweight stakes via the metered hymn's spread, forcing stance crystallization without coincidence resolving. Agency in analyzing dreams and braiding offerings drives escalation, foreclosing direct accusation with ethical trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging truth from silence emerges organically through tapping patterns and cameo dreams, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in gentle exposure's blade. Subtext in frost-burned hands and melted globe reweights memory's forgiveness, inviting reflection on healing costs without sentimentality. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer to truth's surfacing, repricing the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in silt language and starlight borrowing, modulating rhythm under pressure like dawn dive's insistence.

No dialogue, but narrative voice coheres as singular, with syntax reflecting the whisperer's careful weaving.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose density is high with metaphors like "breath makes halos" advancing atmosphere and character without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the dive and breathing at the shrine. Figurative language is controlled, consistent in peak beats like the globe's sigh, with no muddle or register drift. Opening anchors voice in diving, final line resolves by recharging the globe motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes wreck-diving with ghost whispering in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming tropes through specific details like tapping Morse and melted globe as evidence lifeboat.
