<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to decode leaves and build monuments is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like delaying the prod, rooted in grandmother's teachings; interiority is concrete and embodied in tasting phrases and feeling taller, with the final realization earning a resonant endurance that forecloses hasty interpretations with conceptual cost. Strengths shine in character-particular perceptions, avoiding stock phrasing, though some reflections border on summary without stronger contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned elision of leaves and monuments toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where the narrator realizes transformation applies to the hearer, with felt cost in shifted stance; orientation anchors early in the arbor setting without debt; strengths in coherent density increase, though minor redundancy in folklore mentions slightly dilutes propulsion before the phrase arises.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor constrains choices by guiding leaf falls and monument placements, charging the final image of descending with moss on knees; sensory details like ash sifting like sugar and lichens sipping thunder are vivid, POV-filtered, and evolve causally, with the environment mirroring internal prophecy without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, dominant stake in decoding prophecy escalates through pattern break in building seed monuments, deepening with the phrase "Emerges transformed always" that reweights options; one meaningful cadence shift suffices, with visible cost in grounding futures, though pressure remains more internal than interweaving external conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of transformation through listening emerges organically from leaf decoding and monument building, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer that the hearer transforms, embracing complexity without tidy morals; subtext in images like warming dust speck invites reflection, with emotional aftereffect honest and earned via particulars like tasting river clay.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person voice maintains distinct perceptual signature through poetic, mossy delight in syntax and rhythm, with purposeful compression in lyric mode taught early and paid off at closure; no dialogue, so policy skips; elision of time feels motivated, holding under pressure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose density is high with rhythmic variety in sentences like "Leaves release like breath taken back," advancing atmosphere without loops; minor scaffold in repeated ash motifs, but they accumulate purposefully; clarity strong, with no artifacts obscuring closure, though some metaphors like roots braided into cloud border overwriting without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of folklore, floating arbor, and seed monuments transforms familiar transformation tropes through specific worldview of decoding leaves, with risk in lyric structure heightening thematic stakes; feels inevitable in hindsight, like the final realization line, without echoing famous scenes.</comment>
