<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation as a devoted observer rooted in her journalistic heritage drives consistent, high-stakes choices, with embodied interiority shining in the wager proposal; contradictory impulses layer effectively when she believes the caretaker just enough to act, earning the closure's renunciation of silence. The caretaker's secondary pressure refines her stance without overshadowing. Minor stock phrasing in emotional labels slightly dulls specificity, but flaws don't touch pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through echoing imagery and pattern breaks like the lens closing, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost in reweighting media silence; orientation anchors early in the spiral climb. Causality holds via motivated ellipses, with the shutdown tightening knowledge. One hairline slip in abrupt phone buzz absence, but closure lands with legible cost in the board call and daylight pour.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The echoing observatory above clouds constrains choices vividly, with the dome's hush and lens trembling charging the wager and closure; sensory details like ink-cedar smell and tame rain patter reflect POV bias and urgency. Micro-setting of the console and pen nib evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Environment shapes the final image, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering hidden truths escalates through the wager's deepening, narrowing options with the lens shutdown and market hiccups forcing stance crystallization; cost is felt in the caretaker's astonishment and protagonist's board call. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern break in stalled papers reweights stakes effectively. Agency drives the intervention, but coincidence in timing slightly softens reversal purity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of orbits of regret emerges organically through recurring images like star charts and gravity, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the reopened lens and pen nib spike, reweighting media ethics without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like the caretaker's flinch and weary smile enriches complexity. Emotional aftereffect lingers honestly, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in observational metaphors like hollow hush as testimony; rhythmic control heightens pressure in echoes and wind smells without obscurity. Dialogue pursues goals subtextually, as in the dramatist label falling like a gavel. Patterned elision in poetic compression is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose density advances atmosphere through multi-job sentences like the nib smelling of ink and cedar, with varied rhythm avoiding monotony; metaphors cohere without muddle, as in dome repeating harmless like a cough. Minor synonym loop in echo descriptions, but no artifacts touch closure. High propulsion in wager beat satisfies 9+ test partially, held back by one figurative overreach in wind like snow and old photographs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of media influence as tidal device with astronomical metaphors feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific choices like proof by contradiction wager; risk in solemn playfulness heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh angle on regret orbits avoids derivative premises. Core premise commits fully, with the pen nib reprise charging ingenuity.</comment>
