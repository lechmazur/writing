<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The chaste courtesan's motivation to defy conformity is clear and intensifies through her ritual actions, with interiority embodied in poetic movements like "toe-writing a measured rune." Her chastity as a discipline enables unlocking echoes, showing contradictory impulses in chosen emptiness versus harvesting voices. The final renunciation of palace obedience is earned with felt cost in the trembling night, though some traits feel archetypal without deeper flaws complicating choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and repetitions, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the city's pulse changes, with conceptual cost in defied conformity. Orientation anchors early in the silver courtyard under snow. Closure lands on-page with the bowl set upon the prism, reweighting habits, though some elisions feel patterned but not fully taught for payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The silver courtyard under snow is vividly specific, with lanterns bleeding suns and frost translating runes, constraining choices like slipping below paving stones. Atmosphere of alarming serenity mirrors internal defiance, charging the final image of the trembling night. The prism sanctuary recurs to shape ritual and closure, evolving from hush to ringing bell.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of defying conformity tightens under Accumulative lens through deepening echoes and patrol pressure, forcing her quickened weaving with cost in shrinking window. Agency drives the knot-tying reversal, reweighting options as truths awaken. Stakes feel visceral in guards' pausing pikes, though coincidence of timing complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of awakening suppressed voices emerges through recurring echoes and untangled threads, resisting conformity without tidy morals. Subtext in bodily poetic restraint and prism's hushed rainbows invites reflection on chosen emptiness. The final image of the city inhaling differently offers resonant, non-literal reconfiguration of habit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic filters like "breath rose like pale birds." Voice texture is rhythmic and purposeful, with patterned diction taught early and paid off in closure. No dialogue, but elisions are voice-motivated and legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like "snow sifted like slow fire," advancing atmosphere without loops. Figurative language is controlled, though some stacked metaphors in ritual beats risk muddle but pay off in echoes' rise. High information density in closure, with clean grammar and no artifacts dulling the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chaste courtesan harvesting echoes transforms ritual tropes through specific poetic details like untangling vow-threads. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the city's awakened pulse. Originality shines in non-obvious angle on conformity, with bold vision cohering voice and premise.</comment>
