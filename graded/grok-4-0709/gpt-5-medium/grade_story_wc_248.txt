<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's analytically intuitive trait drives concrete micro-choices, like aligning the tapestry to reveal patterns, with embodied emotions like "heart hammering" showing contradictory tenderness and resolve; motivation intensifies credibly to the planting act, foreclosing erasure with felt volcanic cost. Interiority is character-specific, avoiding stock phrasing, though some reflections border on summary without tilting present stance more sharply.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, patterns of images and motifs build density to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the seeds' sprouting reweights the arson as preservation, with undeniable conceptual cost in the vow to rebuild; orientation anchors early in the archive beneath dunes. One meaningful deepening suffices, but ellipsis in mentor's vanishing feels slightly unmotivated without stronger payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive's specifics, like scorched marble mosaics and feather-choked stairs, constrain choices and charge the final atrium image where seeds sprout under sunlight, elevating atmosphere; sensory details are purposeful, mirroring internal tenderness through rippling scales and shivering murals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rescuing the forgotten promise tightens through pattern discoveries, culminating in planting seeds that reweight memory with felt cost in the protagonist's undone state; under Accumulative lens, density increases via artistic trails, though coincidence in alignments slightly complicates without fully resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of preservation through destructive heat emerges organically from arson imagery and seed-sprouting, offering resonant non-literal answer in the living sentence reweighting the ruin as a vow; subtext in Miren's portrait and volcanic tenderness adds complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person voice maintains distinct perceptual signature through poetic, pattern-taught compression like "heart steaming with volcanic tenderness," with rhythmic control heightening pressure in the stitching scene; no dialogue, but elision pays off at closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with purposeful metaphors like "spine of stone halls" advancing atmosphere and momentum; no loops or artifacts dull the sprouting closure, though some figurative stacks in early descriptions risk muddle but resolve legibly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arson as memory-kiln transforms tropes through specific artistic puzzles and volcanic tenderness, feeling inevitable in the seed-planting; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
