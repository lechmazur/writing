<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Jae's motivation to prove sideways time is clear and rooted in his traits as an obliging mechanic with icy warmth, intensifying through his probe-building and lever-pulling actions that compel the story's higher-stakes rescue. Interiority is concrete and particular, embodied in his heart rhythm and fogged breath during the surge, revealing contradictory impulses like fear of temporal shifts versus his calm listening. The final endurance of secrecy forecloses sharing his proof with a felt cost of isolation, earned by prior causality. Relationships are absent as no other characters are on-page, so not penalized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images like beating wings and sideways wind, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where mantas return and Jae feels forgiven, with conceptual cost in his withheld proof and the station's held breath. Orientation anchors early on the plateau rim with the station and Jae by the first paragraph. Closure lands on-page with the mantas' departure smelling of cold salt and new paper, reweighting the stake of subdued awakenings. Persistent constraint of the magnetic nexus shapes his probe tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The xenobiology station on the plateau rim is vividly anchored early, with sensory details like frost smoke and ozone smell filtered through Jae's mechanic bias, evolving causally as wind combs decks and ravine traps possibilities. Atmosphere of paradoxical silence and icy warmth supports the theme, with the ravine and vault constraining choices like lever-pulling. The recurring vault and gantry charge the final image of thawing mantas, meeting the 9+ test by constraining the rescue and repricing time.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rescuing mantas via proving sideways time signals early and deepens through the probe's lattice revealing trapped possibilities, narrowing options under Accumulative/Textural lens with one meaningful intensification at the lever pull. Pressure coheres via geomagnetic shoals and surge tides, forcing Jae's stance crystallization in inverting fields, with felt cost in his isolation and repair work. Agency drives the escalation, but coincidence of the nexus complicates without resolving, keeping it earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sideways time and subdued awakenings emerges organically from images like oil on water and delayed selves, inviting reflection on temporal fluidity without direct statements. Subtext in Jae's whispers to the station and withheld proof creates ambiguity, with the final image of mantas leaving on time offering a resonant, non-literal repricing of reality's corridors. Emotional aftereffect of quiet forgiveness avoids sentimentality, tied inextricably to Jae's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable and close, with perceptual signature in Jae's mechanic-biased noticing of bolts and ozone, modulating rhythm under pressure like shortened breaths during the surge. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax and patterned elision, taught early in harp-like station and sideways wind, paying off at closure without obscurity. Minimal dialogue (Jae's whispers) carries subtext and advances the rescue, fitting the icy warmth tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere in every line like "breath pulled sideways through ice" without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the vault scene. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the lattice city mid-yawn. No artifacts obscure closure, with strong verbs and specific details propelling to the resonant end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of sideways time in a xenobiology station transforms sci-fi tropes through specific mechanic details and poetic temporal mechanics, feeling inevitable in Jae's probe inversion. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, synthesizing fresh angles like orthogonal nows and delayed selves. No close echoes of famous works, with authenticity in the singular vision of icy warmth and forgiven proofs.</comment>
