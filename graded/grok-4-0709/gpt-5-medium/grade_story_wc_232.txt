<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied contradictions, like the promise pulling "like a knot behind my ribs," drives motivated choices; final renunciation earns stasis by foreclosing inaction with felt cost of transformation; Ruth's influence reveals hierarchy of values through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, patterns of imagery (ants, seams) build to a Conceptual Repricing closure with legible cost in the transformed promise; orientation anchors early in the shop and creek; one meaningful deepening at the cavern tightens options, though minor ellipsis in reflections slightly softens causality without breaking lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, POV-filtered details like "elevation lines curl like sleeping cats" and the blooming cavern constrain choices and charge the final ant-bridge image; sensory hierarchy narrows under urgency, mirroring internal states; micro-setting of the chip and seam integrates action with atmospheric purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of fulfilling the lingering promise escalates through creek's rise, forcing stance crystallization under textural lens; one tightening at the seam deepens knowledge with visible cost in foreclosed grief; agency in retrieving the chip drives reconfiguration, though coincidence of storm complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of promises as repeated choices emerges organically from ants and maps, culminating in resonant non-literal answer at the ending's "usability I could trust"; subtext in gestures like pressing the chip invites ambiguity without confusion; avoids moralizing, embracing complexity in Ruth's empirical intuition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in lyric compression, like "shining black commas on pale stones," holds under pressure; consistent first-person POV with purposeful elision taught early and paid off at closure; no dialogue, but rhythmic control heightens introspection without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in lines like "petals glimmer where quartz veins surfaced," with varied rhythm and no loops or artifacts; figurative language enhances clarity in peak beats; opening anchors voice, final image recharges motifs without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of antique maps, ants, and matrix chip transforms tropes into inevitable reconfiguration; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes through patterned imagery; non-obvious angle on choices feels organic, committing to premise without hedging.</comment>
