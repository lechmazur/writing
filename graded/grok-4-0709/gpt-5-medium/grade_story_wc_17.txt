<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to map echoes is rooted in consistent traits like sensitive perception, intensifying through discoveries like the negative and diaries, compelling a stance of acceptance with felt cost in the "shawl woven from echoes." Interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses in kneeling to listen versus shirking the weight, shown in micro-choices like playing hopscotch to reveal secrets. No second character, so relationship bullets ignored; flaws like potential shirking complicate choices without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned discoveries (ivy, diaries, negative) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in accepting the burden, with conceptual cost legible in the final image of the house rising on memory stilts. Orientation anchors who (cartographer), where (drowned district), and when (after climate shifts) by the first sentence, with no disorientation debt. Closure lands on-page with Charged Poise, reweighting options as the map draws "future footfalls" and forgiveness, though one more explicit causal link could tighten the pattern break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The drowned district with seaweed-braided towers and ivy-veiled passage is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices like following ivy and pressing ears to walls, charging the final image of the house rising on memory stilts. Sensory details are selective, POV-biased toward echoes and trembles, with environment mirroring internal legacy burden through tactile, lived-in navigation like coaxing pages from baseboards. Micro-setting of the hearth and negative functions as setting that alters tactics, with consistent world rules post-climate shifts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping walls' dreams escalates through accumulative density of discoveries (diaries, negative, letter), deepening to crystallize stance in accepting legacy's burden, with one meaningful cadence shift narrowing options via the hopscotch revelation. Cost is felt in the heavy shawl and foreclosed anonymity ("my name slid away"), though coincidence of findings slightly complicates without resolving. Under Textural lens, pressure coheres to reweight stakes without needing multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of legacy's burden emerges organically from images like the negative's ghost architecture and the house's memories, inviting reflection on forgiveness through ambiguity in whether to map faithfully or shirk. Subtext in silences and implications, like the unsent letter, elicits emotional aftereffect without sentimentality, with the final image offering a resonant, non-literal answer by charting "a school for hearing." No explicit moralizing; complexity embraces walls aching for forgiveness without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward echoes and pressures, modulating rhythm from flowing metaphors to terse discoveries like "I knelt and pressed my ear." Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax and word choice, teaching patterned elision early (e.g., "salt grammar") and paying off at closure without opacity. No dialogue, so ignored; non-standard grammar is consistent and voice-motivated, enhancing lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, each sentence advancing atmosphere and discovery, like "the click of cooling brick" propelling perception without loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies naturally, with syntactic variety in metaphors like "curled like a sleeping eel" avoiding muddle; no artifacts obscure closure, though dense figuratives in peak beats are pattern-taught and payoff in resonant images. Clarity and propulsion are strong, with final line recharging motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of echo cartography in a post-climate world transforms ruin tropes through specific choices like hopscotch on dust to map grief, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, offering fresh angle on legacy via walls dreaming and ivy reports. No derivative echoes; authenticity coheres as singular vision of listening to architecture.</comment>
