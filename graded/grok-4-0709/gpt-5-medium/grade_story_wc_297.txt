<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation as a root-bound visionary is clear and intensifies through curiosity about the covenant's breach, compelling choices like linking scars and heeding whispers, with embodied emotions in grafts and ribs. Interiority is concrete via metaphorical embodiment, showing contradictory impulses in brave-foolish elation, though some stock phrasing like "anxious elation" slightly dilutes specificity. The woman's presence as a secondary character applies pressure, forcing a shared map that alters the covenant's state by the end. Flaws complicate choices, with the graft limiting mobility but enabling tree-based sealing of the new vow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered imagery and pattern breaks, like hedges growing words, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the braided vow and reconfigured maze, with felt cost in scars and foreclosed old promises. Orientation anchors early in the cobalt glade at dusk, with no disorientation debt. Closure lands on-page with the intersection of dreams curving onward, reweighting stakes via conceptual repricing of oaths from circular to braided. Minor ellipsis in the future's arrival feels motivated but could tighten causal links slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt glade at dusk is vividly anchored with sensory details like humming leaves and residual lightning, filtered through the POV's grafted state, where the environment constrains choices via roots and hedges while charging the final blurred border image. Micro-setting of the body (grafts, scars) and recurring objects (pool, maze) evolve causally, mirroring internal breaches without overt symbolism. Tone tensions the surreal dusk effectively, supporting theme through purposeful ambiguity. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, with the glade pressuring the climax at the sundial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding the dreams' intersection signals early and deepens via scar-linking, narrowing options in the maze with a meaningful cadence shift under the Accumulative lens, forcing stance crystallization in the new braided vow. Agency manifests in renunciation of the old covenant, with visible cost in joined pain and foreclosed paths, though coincidence of the woman's arrival slightly complicates without fully resolving. Tension layers at sentence and story scales, with wants (curiosity) conflicting fears (shadow's speed). One credible loss in the withered oath alters tactics effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of withered promises blooming anew emerges organically from images like the eclipsed sun and growing maze, with subtext in scars as bridges and hedges whispering, inviting reflection on time's rush without direct statements. The final image of overlapping dreams offers a resonant, non-literal answer to oaths' fragility, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost in the blurred waking-dreaming border. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through complex ambiguity, embracing plausible counter-readings like the gardeners' reluctance. Protagonist's arc intertwines with thematic questions of meddling versus heeding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and apt, with distinct perceptual signature in metaphorical noticing like leaf-veins lit with lightning, and rhythmic control via varied syntax that heightens anxious elation without obscurity. Purposeful compression in lyric mode teaches patterns early, paying off at closure with legible reconfiguration under the lens. Narrative stance modulates emotionally, with diction within the visionary's lexicon, avoiding register drift. Limited dialogue (e.g., woman's scar explanation) carries subtext and advances plot naturally, though sparse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose features high density with purposeful figurative language, like "ribbon pulled from a mouth," advancing atmosphere without muddle, though some stacked metaphors in peak beats risk overwriting but pay off in pattern. No significant loops or scaffolds; syntax varies for propulsion, with strong verbs and specific nouns driving momentum. Opening anchors voice in the glade's hum, and final line resolves by recharging dusk's blur. Minor artifact in repetitive whisper motifs feels taught and intentional, not obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grafted visionary and living maze transforms garden tropes through specific surreal choices, like scars as maps and early-arriving future, feeling inevitable in hindsight with bold risk in lyric structure that heightens stakes. Core premise offers fresh angle on promises via eclipsed covenants, committing to implications without retreat. Emotional specificity in anxious elation avoids generics, with non-obvious moral calculus in braided vows. Proximity check clears; no echoes of famous scenes without transformation.</comment>
