<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation as a "contact tracer for hearts" is clear and intensifies through persistent curiosity, leading to the guiding of the call as a meaningful endurance with felt cost in the reeling hush. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses like wasteful walking versus supervisory caution acting in scene. The man's grief and the child's voice apply secondary pressure, revealing the narrator's hierarchy of values in the gallery confrontation. Voice distinction holds in the narrator's perceptual idiom, though the child's speech converges slightly under emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elisions and image density, culminating in a Charged Poise closure where guiding the dial reconfigures grief's options with undeniable conceptual cost in the shared hush. Orientation anchors who (narrator), where (atrium to gallery), and when (twilight) by ~120 words, with deliberate mist disorientation paying off in the fogged ending. One meaningful deepening occurs as the hearing aid's pulses swing, narrowing knowledge without causality breaks. The final image reweights the premise of incidental finding with visible patience as cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight anchors early and constrains choices, with fog sliding in to mirror the reeling hush and charge the final gallery image. Sensory details are vivid and POV-biased, like the hearing aid warm as a pocketed sparrow, evolving causally to thrum and guide action. The micro-setting of the hearing aid and photographs pressures tactics, with the gallery's unclaimed moments mirroring internal grief. Environment affects navigation, as the city answers only to feet, heightening the walk's curiosity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of tracing lost connections escalates through pattern breaks like the aid's thrumming intensification, reweighting grief with felt cost in the man's unintended call. One meaningful deepening narrows options when the pulses swing to the man, forcing stance crystallization in guiding the dial. Agency drives the walk and assurance despite supervisory waste, with coincidence complicating but not resolving the revelation. Moral calculus sharpens in balancing listening's tenderness against time's rupture, though cost clarity softens slightly in the incidental heroism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of incidental heroism through persistent listening emerges organically from images like the undulling pencil and thrumming aid, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in grief's redial. Subtext in silences and implications, such as the steam's question mark, invites reflection on vulnerability without confusion. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting finding as a process of patience. Emotional aftereffect lingers through the shared hush, avoiding sentimentality with complex counter-readings of rupture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in metaphors like wind in a bottle, modulating rhythm under pressure without head-hopping. Purposeful compression in lyric mode teaches patterns early, paying off in the thread-like line at closure. Dialogue is natural and subtext-driven, advancing the trace with indirection like the child's swallow vibrating the line. Prose texture reflects the focalizer's mind, with syntax breathing in the reeling hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, but occasional figurative muddle like "pinging like a swallowed star" clashes slightly in peak beats without full payoff. No loops or scaffolds obscure clarity, though some metaphors stack in the gallery without harming closure. Opening anchors voice in the trembling phones; final line resolves by recharging listening's will. Clarity holds with strong verbs, though one register drift into ceremonial title feels mildly elevated for the POV.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise of tracing dead calls through artifacts offers a fresh synthesis of grief and technology, feeling inevitable in the aid's pulses leading to incidental heroism. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes like unclaimed photos through specific worldview. Originality shines in the ear's tenderness habit, a non-obvious inflection reweighting the search. Authenticity coheres in the singular stance of listening as structure, avoiding derivative templates.</comment>
