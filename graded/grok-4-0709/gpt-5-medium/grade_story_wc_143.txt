<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to preserve the moth's song through photography is rooted in personal history and intensifies credibly, with embodied emotions like a "clean and still" throat revealing contradictory impulses of purpose and melancholy; interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The meaningful endurance forecloses inaction with felt emotional cost at the moth's departure. However, the mother's backstory, while anchoring reflection, occasionally summarizes without tilting present micro-choices as sharply as possible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and timed vials to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the hush reweights preservation's limits with undeniable conceptual cost in the final line; orientation anchors early in the moonlit summit. The pattern of chemical timers and reflections accumulates density, breaking with the moth's flight for resonant reconfiguration. Minor elision in agency transitions slightly softens causality without breaking the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The moonlit summit is vividly specific, with ragged rims and solar wind constraining choices like using chemical timers over electronics, directly charging the final image of the moth's ascent; sensory details like silver bowl and dew-kissed reagents reflect POV bias and urgency. Environment evolves causally, mirroring internal loss without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake of photographing the moth before dawn tightens through vial timers, deepening with ochre flame and scratching wing, forcing stance crystallization under textural lens with emotional cost in the protagonist's still throat; agency via thumbing the camera forecloses delay. Coherent pressure from approaching dawn and satellite interference complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence versus preservation emerges organically through images like the moth's lantern-like abdomen and sand grain, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer that the hush belongs to breath, reweighting the premise without moralizing; subtext in silences and implications invites lingering ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect is concrete, avoiding sentimentality via embodied melancholy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person voice maintains distinct perceptual signature through poetic, selective noticing like "curved prayer" and rhythmic control that heightens under pressure, with patterned metaphors taught early and paid off at closure; no head-hopping or unmotivated elision. Non-standard syntax feels voice-motivated and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid metaphors like "silver bowl holding a slow breath" advancing atmosphere and character, varying rhythm purposefully; however, occasional overwriting in stacked figures like "abdomen like a lantern that refuses to admit it is dying" muddles clarity in peak beats without fully obscuring propulsion. No significant loops or artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes sci-fi crater inspection with lyrical moth preservation in a non-obvious way, transforming tropes of loss through specific details like chemical vials and glacier seam, feeling inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in dense poetic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
