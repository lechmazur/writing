<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to restore trust is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like composing promises, rooted in traits like careful recklessness that enable the climax; interiority is concrete via embodied memories, such as faltering on the salt ravine excavation, showing contradictory impulses. Lio's return and revision reveal status dynamics under pressure, with flaws complicating choices without hedging. Emotions are embodied in heart fugueing and shoulders lowering, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned reflections and motifs like promises and symphonies, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the joint revision and final walk, with felt cost in released hush and confessed fears. Orientation anchors early in the archive before dawn. Closure lands on-page with conceptual repricing of trust as choreography, though one ellipsis in Lio's arrival feels slightly coincidental but complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The extinct language archive setting is vivid and purposeful, with dust motes as annotations and shelves sighing, constraining choices like placing pages where the archive listens; it charges the final image of dawn uncoupling, evolving causally as wind presses windows and shadows loosen. Sensory details are selective, filtered through POV bias, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring trust escalates through textural density in composing movements, deepening with the memory falter and Lio's return, forcing stance crystallization in revision; one meaningful tightening suffices, with visible cost in bruised truths and released hush. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, though coincidence in Lio's appearance complicates without fully resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of trust as symphonic vulnerability emerges organically from interconnected promises and motifs like braids, culminating in a resonant final image of joined hands holding a door open, reweighting silence without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like lowered shoulders and sigils invites reflection on ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in wavering glyphs and quill scratches, modulating rhythm under pressure; dialogue is natural, subtextual, advancing reconciliation, with voices distinguished by brittleness and alignment. Patterned diction in lyric mode is taught early and pays off at closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm in metaphors like dust motes as footnotes, avoiding loops though some figurative stacking in peak beats risks muddle; clarity holds at closure with strong verbs and concise advancement. No major artifacts obscure the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic revival and musical promises transforms tropes of absence and reconciliation through specific details like the Breviary of Maz and stele chord, feeling inevitable with risk in vulnerability heightening stakes. Bold lyric structure coheres without gimmickry.</comment>
