<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The reaper's motivation is clear and intensifies through his loss of Miren, driving higher-stakes naming with embodied emotion in lines like "the gentleness broke him like frost breaks a reed"; interior contradiction shows in his useless tenderness versus the scythe's focus, earning the final renunciation of triumph with felt cost. Minor stock phrasing in emotional labels slightly dilutes specificity, but flaws do not touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned echoes and density increase, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where naming "Shoreless" reweights absence with conceptual cost in the "new corridor of work"; orientation anchors early at the observatory, and causality holds via textural linkages without breaks. One meaningful deepening suffices, with the cylinder's hiss forcing stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains choices through its dome, lens, and echoes, charging the final image where Miren's voice shelves like a star chart; sensory details like dust and brine are selective and POV-biased, mirroring internal loss without overt symbolism. Environment evolves causally, with the atlas page integrating action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of naming fears escalates texturally through cylinder whispers and light scattering, deepening via the flickering figure to force agency in naming "Shoreless" with unmistakable emotional cost; one tightening suffices, though coincidence in recognizing Miren's voice slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of naming as bridge amid sacrifice emerges organically from images like sea monsters and gulls, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final harbor smudge that reweights loss without moralizing; subtext in silences and implications enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in thunder-smelling vellum and grit-filled air; prose texture in rhythmic, patterned diction teaches lyric compression early, paying off at closure without head-hopping or elision issues. No dialogue present, so those bullets ignored.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in metaphors like "dome breathed like a sleeping lung" without loops or artifacts; clarity propels through multi-job sentences, and final line resolves with resonant image. No overwriting or template cadence muddles peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reaper mythology with astronomical naming transforms tropes through specific grief and atlas monsters, feeling inevitable in the scythe's "thin, kind star"; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
