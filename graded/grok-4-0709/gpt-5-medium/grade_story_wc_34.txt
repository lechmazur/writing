<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to articulate unspoken needs is clear and intensifies through patient listening, rooted in traits like drifting alertness that compel choices like bolting the plate; interiority is concrete via embodied thirst and trembling throat, with contradictory impulses in past loud songs versus current quiet patience. Emotions are embodied in the throat answering and hands moving with tempo, avoiding stock phrasing. The meaningful endurance earns stasis by foreclosing louder paths with felt cost in failures, shown in crooked arrows. No second character, so relationship bullets ignored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, orientation anchors early in the misty courtyard above clouds with the balladeer; structure builds through patterned images and cadence shifts, culminating in Charged Poise closure where the narrator becomes a hinge, reconfiguring options with conceptual cost of ongoing patience and failures. Closure lands on-page with the final image of the courtyard as a lung between breaths, reweighting the stake. One meaningful deepening suffices, with persistent constraint of storm timing shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting anchors early and vividly with misty courtyard above clouds, sensory details like hum tasting of rain and charged brass filtered through POV bias; environment constrains choices, as wires beneath stones and steam valves enable ghost interaction, charging the final image of the courtyard as a breathing body. Micro-setting of the flower press bolt plate functions as tool that charges closure. Tone tensions wonder with thirst, supporting theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, dominant stake of articulating unspoken needs signals early and deepens via storm pressure, forcing stance crystallization in bolting the plate and encoding maps; one meaningful cadence shift narrows options, with visible cost in trembling throat and failed rhymes. Agency in endurance forecloses paths with felt price charging the final image. Coincidence of storm complicates but does not resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of listening to hidden needs emerges through images like cupped hands and city as body, with subtext in graffiti silences; final image offers resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting premise as ongoing translation without stated moral. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality via bruised perfume and patience for echoes. Purposeful ambiguity lingers in ghost's stutter without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in drifting alertness and selective noticing of colors and valves; prose texture in rhythmic, patterned diction teaches lyric mode early, paying off at closure with legible effect under lens. No dialogue, so ignored; purposeful compression and elision heighten wonder without obscurity. Psychic distance shifts intentionally with storm intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and character via vivid images like tinkersong wonder; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops or scaffold, though dense metaphors in peak beats like storm walking risk muddle but pay off without clarity loss. No artifacts obscure closure; final line recharges motifs effectively. Information propulsion aligns with lyric mode.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of balladeer, ghost in code, and graffiti encoding feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like flower press bolt plate as harp; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise with fresh angle on urban needs. Non-obvious reconfiguration at end arises from particulars. Authenticity coheres as singular vision.</comment>
