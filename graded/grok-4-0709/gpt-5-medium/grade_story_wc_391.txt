<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to sculpt patience from impatience is consistent and intensifies through micro-choices like mapping moon paths and teaching the village, with embodied contradictions in the "unyoke another yapping urgency" line revealing internal conflict. The girl's arrival adds relational pressure, forcing a shared walk that alters the protagonist's stance. However, interiority leans abstract and metaphorical, with emotions more declared than contradictorily embodied in peak moments like the men's grumbling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images like moon paths and the viaduct, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final gathering where patience stands as revolution, with conceptual cost in foreclosed fears. Orientation anchors early with the frozen lake and sanctuary. Closure lands on-page with the basalt warming and village boots shedding thaw, reweighting prior urgency into steadiness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary by the frozen lake anchors vividly and constrains choices, like sleeping on warm stone to tune ears to ice thunder, charging the final image of gathering. Sensory details are selective and POV-biased, with wind combing reeds and ice crackling mirroring internal hush. The viaduct's humming and magnetic pull evolve causally, guiding walks and steadiness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of cultivating a patient revolution escalates through pattern breaks like the girl's arrival and village men's worry, deepening into a cadence shift at dusk's widening steadiness, with felt cost in unyoked fears. One meaningful tightening suffices, as teaching tasks reweight urgency without spectacle. Coincidence of messenger complicates but doesn't resolve; agency is in renunciation of shout for soft purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of sculpting patience from impatience emerges organically through images like tracking moon paths and unyoking urgencies, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer as the revolution stands without storm or blade. Subtext in gestures like the girl untying a knot invites reflection on waiting without surrender. Emotional aftereffect is honest, avoiding sentiment via grumbling men and quiet thaw.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic noticing of horizons and ice music, modulating rhythm under pressure like counting breaths on the viaduct. Dialogue is natural and subtextual, as in telling the girl the road answers or men to watch horizons, advancing teaching without declaration. Patterned elision in lyric compression is taught early and pays off at closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, as lines like "breath plumes like banners" advance atmosphere and character; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in walks and breathing in sanctuary scenes. Figurative language is controlled without muddle, though occasional synonym loops like "patient but not tame" and "patient revolution" slightly drag momentum. No major artifacts obscure closure, with strong verbs and specific nouns propelling to the warming basalt.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of a horizon mapper sculpting patience via magnetic viaducts and moon paths offers fresh synthesis of lyric observation and quiet revolution, transforming waiting tropes through specific images like rook feather and iron dust springs. Risk in accumulative structure heightens stakes organically without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in unyoking urgencies feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
