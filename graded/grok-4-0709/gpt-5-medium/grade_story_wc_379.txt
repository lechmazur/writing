<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to prove listening heals is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like selecting the locket and leading the circle, revealing internal contradictions in leadership via following; secondary characters like Marta and Jonah apply pressure through their stories, though their flaws feel more thematic than individualized. Emotions are embodied in the collective "ache," but some stock phrasing like "throat clearing before confession" edges toward cliché without deeper contradiction. The final renunciation of force for patience earns stasis with felt communal cost, foreclosing isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through shard-like stories toward a resonant reconfiguration when the mailbox opens, with conceptual cost in reweighting community healing; orientation anchors early in the courtyard at dawn, and the single transition to developers intruding serves pressure without disorientation. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing via the letters' revelations, with undeniable social cost in shared vulnerability. One meaningful deepening suffices, as rumors accumulate to convince the lock.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The vibrant courtyard at dawn anchors vividly with sensory details like "sandal scuffs and coffee breath" and "hibiscus shadows," constraining choices by gathering the community; atmosphere evolves with intruding noise, mirroring internal hush, and the mailbox as micro-setting charges the final image by opening to kindness. Sensory hierarchy reflects the narrator's bias toward auditory calm, with details integrated into action like tapping the seam.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake in proving listening heals tightens accumulatively through shared stories, culminating in the mailbox's sigh-open as a cadence shift reweighting communal ache with healing cost; one deepening via the hairpin tap forces stance crystallization without coincidence resolving. Agency in endurance forecloses isolation with felt relational price in the vendor's tearless cry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of listening as healing emerges organically from accumulating stories and the mailbox's opening, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in Noemi's pilgrimage; subtext in silences and implications like the "throat cleared for ongoing song" invites reflection on communal vulnerability. The final image of the unlocked box offers a resonant, non-literal answer reweighting isolation's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in auditory metaphors like "hum held a sandstorm calm," modulating rhythm under pressure; purposeful compression in lyric shards teaches pattern early, paying off at closure without head-hopping. Dialogue, though minimal, carries subtext in whispers and confessions, advancing accumulation naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose density advances atmosphere with vivid images like "stories came like moths to a porch bulb," varying rhythm without loops; some figurative muddle in mixed metaphors (e.g., "spine relaxing under communal breath") slightly dulls clarity, but no artifacts touch closure. Information propulsion is high, with sentences multitasking in peak beats like the tapping sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystery and communal healing transforms trope of locked secrets through specific courtyard listening, feeling inevitable in the hairpin's role; risk in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise's implications in the unlocked "throat."</comment>
