<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to preserve hope drives her choices with clear interior contradiction, embodied in her deliberate gait and the river stone's weight; emotions layer contradictorily, as joy arrives with luminous regret at the climax, earning the stasis with visible cost in her sacrificed dreams.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, imagery builds density toward a resonant reconfiguration in the ending, with Mira's endurance foreclosing unlived paths at felt cost; orientation anchors early in the blooming library, though elliptical transitions slightly blur causality without harming closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The blooming library above clouds vividly constrains choices, with vines tightening aisles and petals unfurling stairways that pressure Mira's bargain; this micro-setting charges the final petal storm, reweighting the closure image of her name inked in the sky.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reuniting the shadow escalates through textural deepening via footage comparison and stone anchoring, narrowing options with the library's jealousy; cost is legible in Mira's poured dreams, though coincidence of the shadow's pause slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of preserving hope amid regret emerges organically from images like bottled slumber and unlived rooms, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in silences and vines tugs enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent third-person close POV with poetic texture in syntax and rhythm suits the lyric mode, teaching patterned elision early; perceptual signature biases toward dusk noticing, and brief dialogue carries subtext, though dense diction occasionally strains under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose propels with high density and rhythmic variety, but occasional paraphrase loops like repeated shadow descriptions dull momentum; figurative clarity holds at closure, with no major artifacts obscuring the petal storm applause.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of unbound shadow and blooming library transforms familiar loss tropes through specific fantasy logic, heightening stakes with bold risk in Mira's trade; the non-obvious luminous regret feels inevitable, charging the closure without gimmickry.</comment>
