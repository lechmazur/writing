<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The undertaker's motivation to assign permanent rest is clear and intensifies through stubborn persistence, with embodied emotions like breathing "like it belongs to me" revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, as seen in the promise to names "dressed in linen." The final endurance forecloses evasion with felt cost, earning the stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, patterned imagery of signals and rest builds to a resonant reconfiguration where the library becomes home, with conceptual cost in redefining distress as permission. Orientation anchors early in the mortuary and harbor, serving closure without disorientation. Closure lands on-page with the etched stamp and SOR code, reweighting stakes via undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The underwater library's domes, shelves, and bioluminescent vents constrain choices, pressuring the lens alignment and charging the final glow that flickers above. Sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, like "water thin as breath," mirroring internal regret without overt symbolism. Micro-setting of the desk and vents directly shapes the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake in granting rest escalates through textural density of chased stillness and scraping anchors, forcing stance crystallization against the mantled thing with visible cost in hurried alignment. One meaningful deepening narrows options as voices answer, under the lens. Coincidence of the package complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of rest as location emerges organically from images like tethered books and SOS shifts to SOR, offering resonant ambiguity without tidy morals. Subtext in glints hopping titles and etched stamp invites reflection on loss. Final image reweights premise non-literally, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters through weary, poetic lens, with rhythmic syntax like staccato signals modulating under stress. Patterned elision in metaphors is taught early and pays off at closure without obscurity. No dialogue, so policy skips; POV stable and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose density high with rhythmic variety, like "three shorts and three longs," advancing atmosphere without loops or artifacts. Figurative language consistent and purposeful, though occasional stacking in peak beats slightly muddles propulsion, as in the vestibule scraping. Clarity and concision propel to resonant close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of undertaker in underwater library transforming distress signals feels inevitable, with risk in mosaic structure heightening thematic stakes. Tropes like drowned lighthouses are grounded in specific voice, avoiding echoes. Bold commitment to premise without hedging.</comment>
