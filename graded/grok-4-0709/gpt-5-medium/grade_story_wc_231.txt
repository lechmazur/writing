<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to decode the gesture is clear and rooted in his softly persistent trait, intensifying through embodied observations like crouching to peer at scratches, revealing internal contradictions between isolation and duty without stock phrasing. Emotions are embodied in the weight of witnessed isolation settling on him, aligning actions with motives and showing micro-choices under pressure, such as setting the flower and signaling. The meaningful endurance forecloses deeper involvement with a felt cost of borrowed promises, earning high marks despite minimal relationship dynamics in this single-POV piece. The line "I felt that weight settle now, not as grief for myself, but as an accounting I had agreed to keep" exemplifies embodied emotion influencing the final stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned observations and reflective shards to a resonant reconfiguration in the signaling and ledger entry, with conceptual cost legible in the promise that can be borrowed but not owned. Orientation anchors who (lighthouse keeper), where (opal dock), and when (nautical twilight) by the first sentence, avoiding penalties. Closure lands as Charged Poise via the replied light and swept notch, reweighting the stranger's gesture with undeniable pressure without requiring a decisive physical act. The persistent constraint of the dock's "borrowed memories" shapes tactics, elevating the score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The opal dock in mist is vividly specific, with sensory details like smoothed stone and ice chiming filtered through the keeper's perceptual bias, constraining choices such as finding the notch and peering along the grain. Atmosphere supports the tone of witnessed isolation, evolving causally as mist pulls into ribbons during the signal, charging the final image. The micro-setting of the dock's seams and pilings directly pressures the investigation, mirroring internal gaps without overt symbolism. The recurring dock as kin gives back touched memories, constraining the closure and satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake of decoding the stranger's gesture escalates through accumulative pressure, deepening via the recalled girl's story and notch discovery, narrowing options to the signaling act under the Textural lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when the flower fits the notch, forcing stance crystallization with the cost of perpetual accounting felt in the isolation's weight. Agency manifests in renunciation of shrine-building, foreclosing paths with legible emotional price. The reply light, potentially coincidental, complicates but does not resolve, aligning with lens guardrails.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of witnessed isolation and borrowed promises emerges organically from images like the Edelweiss and dock notches, resisting tidy morals through ambiguity in the replying light. Subtext in gestures and gaps invites reflection on unspoken ledgers, with the final image offering a resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting the sea's hunger. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars like the gulls quieting, avoiding sentimentality. The core concept integrates via the inverted signal, deepening complexity without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature in selective noticing of gaps and echoes, modulating rhythm from hushed vows to steady breathing under pressure. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax like "colors hushed themselves to gray vows," purposeful and pattern-taught without opacity. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; elision in reflections anchors in cues like the flower, tilting stance via micro-choices. The final line's compression pays off the voice, satisfying the 9+ test with rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through images like "opal sheen underfoot" without loops or scaffold; syntactic variety breathes with emotional beats, avoiding template cadence. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, such as the dock knowing hands like kin, propelling momentum to closure without muddle. Minor overwriting in early mist descriptions does not obscure peak beats, and clarity holds with strong verbs. The opening anchors voice, and final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing lighthouse keeper tropes with borrowed memories and gap-observing method, transforming familiar isolation through specific details like the Edelweiss signal inversion. The non-obvious angle on decoding gestures via dock notches feels inevitable, with risk in lyric compression heightening stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generics, committing to the premise's implications. The fresh inflection in the replied light reconfigures meaning organically.</comment>
