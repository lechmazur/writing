<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's wistful motivation as a lantern broker is clear and intensifies through sensory-triggered grief, leading to an earned emotional shift with felt cost in the tears; interiority is concrete via embodied reactions like stinging eyes and buckling to the floor, though some phrasing borders on abstract therapy-speak in lines like "hunger for meaning in the fog."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned sensory and reflective shards to a Conceptual Repricing closure where memories are reweighted as shaping currents, with felt cost in the protagonist's healing tears; orientation anchors early in the greenhouse, and one meaningful deepening at the flower's opening suffices, though causality is more elided than chained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting is vivid and purposeful, with moisture, ferns, and extinct plants constraining choices and charging the final image of disciplined bloom; sensory details like cedar scent and crystal shadows mirror internal grief, and the environment directly enables the ultraviolet revelation, fulfilling the 9+ test by shaping the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding scent-triggered grief escalates texturally through accumulating memories and the flower's opening, forcing a stance crystallization with emotional cost in the tears; one deepening suffices, but pressure remains subtle without sharp trade-offs, and coincidence of the etched name complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of memories as transformative currents emerges organically from scents, lanterns, and extinct plants, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the final image of the vial as compass; subtext in silences and implications enriches complexity without moralizing, though some direct statements like "understanding is not a purchase but a schedule" border on assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person voice is distinct and rhythmic, with poetic compression and patterned diction like "crystal shadows" taught early and paid off; perceptual signature biases toward sensory fog and light, dialogue carries subtext naturally in Marla's whispers, and no head-hopping occurs, meeting the 9+ test under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm and strong verbs, multi-tasking lines like "petals unlock with disciplined lightning" to advance atmosphere and theme; some figurative density in peak beats risks muddle but pays off without loops, though minor scaffold in repetitive scent motifs slightly dulls momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lantern broking, extinct plants, and scent-memory grief feels inevitable through fresh metaphors like "smells stir uninvited storms," heightening stakes with bold lyric risk that charges closure without gimmickry; it transforms familiar loss tropes via specific ultraviolet mechanics and emotional specificity.</comment>
