<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The oracle's motivation is clear and intensifies through her obsession with writable quiet, leading to earned endurance with felt cost in her bleeding fingers as she scratches the map. Interiority is embodied in specific actions like prying the booklet and noting gaps, revealing contradictory impulses between faith and the flaking gold's impermanence. The courier's shift from skepticism to understanding is motivated by the shared listening, with status dynamics legible in his initial snort and final bow. However, some emotions lean toward abstract marbled hushes rather than raw, contradictory embodiment under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, holding through pattern breaks in silence and cadence shifts that reweight the stake of mapping the night, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the oracle's Earned Stasis (staying to finish the map) carries visible cost in bleeding fingers and the courier's path opens. Orientation anchors early with the oracle climbing the ridge fort under one star. Closure lands on-page with conceptual cost as the star steadies like a nail, reconfiguring options without mechanical resolution. Minor hairline slip in mid-story ellipsis, but it serves the texture without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The storm-tossed ridge fort anchors vividly early, with salt-stung knuckles and humming towers constraining choices like prying the booklet amid wind. Sensory details are selective and POV-biased, evolving causally as the wind falters and sea settles, mirroring the oracle's hush. The setting charges the final image as she draws into soaked stones, with the fort growing taller by not falling. Micro-setting of the booklet as object-environment integrates tactile navigation under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping the night's silences signals early and deepens through a meaningful cadence shift as they listen together, narrowing options and forcing the courier's stance crystallization from fear to purpose under the Textural lens. Pressure coheres via coherent environmental forces like wind and surf, with one visible cost in the oracle's bleeding fingers foreclosing ease. Agency in her renunciation (giving the booklet, staying behind) earns the reconfiguration, though stakes remain somewhat abstract without a sharper ethical trade-off. Coincidence of the star's wavering complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of night's lacunae as a map for endurance emerges organically from images like flaking gold and summarized silences, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer as the booklet becomes an instrument for the fearful. Subtext in gestures like the shared look and torn sleeve invites reflection on forgiveness without tidy morals. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars like the star as patient pupil, avoiding sentimentality. Coherent integration with core concept of ambered hush deepens without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in selective noticing of hushes and gaps, modulating rhythm to a marbled hush under pressure. Prose texture is distinct in patterned diction like "flaking like tired moons," teaching elision early and paying off at closure without opacity. Dialogue carries subtext and advances the stake, as in her map explanation shifting his fear, with natural indirection. Minor register drift in elevated metaphors feels voice-motivated but borders on academic in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and theme through vivid images like "gold leaf bruising under rain like ripened fruit" without loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in listening pauses and breathing at closure, with syntactic variety supporting emphasis. No artifacts obscure clarity, even in figurative peaks, and final line recharges motifs effectively. Information propulsion is strong, though one simultaneity hint in wind faltering could tighten.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of oracle trope with silence-cartography feels inevitable, transforming familiar night motifs through specific risks like bleeding into stones, heightening stakes without gimmickry. Fresh angle in night's lacunae as body-map offers non-obvious emotional truth, with ingenuity in contours agreeing with rest needs. Bold poetic structure coheres as singular vision, earning +0.3 risk bonus. No derivative echoes; premise commits fully.</comment>
