<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The solitary summoner's motivation to hush the prophecy is clear but remains abstract and unconflicted, lacking embodied contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure that reveal values with cost. Interiority uses poetic phrasing like "lantern of calm" but feels stock and unparticular, avoiding genuine flaws or stress degradation. The fox as a secondary presence applies no immediate pressure, reducing relational crucible potential. This abstraction weakens the closure's emotional legibility, as the summoner's smile lacks a felt before/after cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and cadence shifts toward a Conceptual Repricing where the code unties and the future exhales, with conceptual cost in remade patience; however, orientation anchors who and where early but leaves "when" vague without serving closure. Causality is loose, with events like the wing's drift feeling elliptical rather than linked, though the pattern is taught early. The closure lands on-page with subtle reconfiguration, but lacks a persistent constraint shaping tactics, capping strength.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven beside the brook anchors early with vivid, purposeful sensory details like "terrestrially cosmic shimmer" that reflect the summoner's perceptual bias and subtly mirror internal hush. Environmental elements evolve causally, with the brook's flow guiding choices and charging the final ladder image. A recurring object (origami wing) constrains the mapping action and reweights the ending. Tone tensions tranquility with cosmic stakes effectively, though some metaphors border on overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of unwriting the prophecy via silence deepens through pattern breaks like braided currents and untied code, with one meaningful cadence shift narrowing options; however, pressure remains abstract without a visible cost or agency-driven tightening that forces trade-offs. Coincidence in the fox's watching complicates but doesn't resolve. The closure's reconfiguration feels earned texturally but lacks protagonist-driven escalation, keeping stakes visceral only in metaphor. Moral calculus is implied but not sharpened in a peak choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of listening as mercy emerges organically from images like the wing's drift and untied seam, embracing complexity without tidy morals and inviting reflection through ambiguity in the remade future. Subtext in silences and ripples offers resonant implication, culminating in a non-literal final image that reweights the prophecy's noise. However, some direct statements like "listening keeps the world from hardening" border on thematic echo, slightly undercutting earned wisdom. Emotional aftereffect lingers via particulars, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable and close, with perceptual signature in biased noticing of creases and ripples; rhythmic control modulates with pressure, using patterned elision like "Go, it meant" effectively. Prose texture is distinct in syntax and metaphor, teaching lyric compression early for legibility at closure. Minimal dialogue ("I do not erase") carries subtext and advances the hush without unnatural phrasing. No head-hopping or register drift, though some certainty in interpreting water's grammar pushes POV modesty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with multi-job sentences like "The brook ran with sleeping stars," advancing atmosphere and theme without loops; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the untying seam. Figurative language is controlled but dense in peak beats, with mixed metaphors like "moonmilk" and "paper thunder" occasionally muddling clarity without harming closure. No major artifacts or scaffold, though some synonym churn in "hush" repetitions feels near-redundant. Final line resolves with resonant image, propelling to a charged poise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise of mapping silence to unwrite prophecy offers fresh synthesis of origami, brook arithmetic, and cosmic hush, transforming tropes through specific, voice-driven imagery like the fox's comma tail. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the exhaled future. Emotional specificity avoids generics, with authenticity in the unlonely solitude. A non-obvious inflection in the wing's return charges closure, elevating ingenuity.</comment>
