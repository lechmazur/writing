<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and particular through tidal metaphors, with contradictory impulses in the pause leading to an earned decision; motivation roots in traits like warmly observant, compelling the choice to go inland with felt cost of leaving the coast, as seen in foreseen futures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, density builds via reflective patterns to a resonant reconfiguration in the final "Yes, I will go inland," with conceptual cost of transition legible; orientation anchors early in the grotto, and one meaningful cadence shift suffices for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The grotto's slick stone and dripping metronome constrain the pause, charging the final resolution with starlight on the cicada; sensory details filter through POV bias, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of inland move vs. coastal life deepens through textural reflections on foreseen paths, narrowing options to a crystallizing choice; agency in decision forecloses stasis with visible relational cost, sufficient under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transitions emerges organically from cicada metaphor and pause, offering resonant non-literal answer in the final arch without moralizing; subtext in silence and images invites ambiguity on change's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV stable with distinct perceptual signature in marine idioms; rhythmic prose modulates with emotional intensity, teaching patterned elision that pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density and propulsion through varied syntax and rhythm; no loops or artifacts, with metaphors like "foam tightened by wind" advancing atmosphere cleanly, especially in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal chronicling and cicada as transition metaphor transforms relationship trope; risk in lyric reflection heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the final passage.</comment>
