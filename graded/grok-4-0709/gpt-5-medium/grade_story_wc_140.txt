<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to reclaim erased memories through fragments is clear and intensifies toward the confrontation, with embodied emotions like bitter fingertips revealing internal conflict; however, the widow's reactions feel slightly stock, lacking deeper contradictory impulses in their brief interaction. The final endurance as a nameless listener earns stasis with felt cost of ongoing erasure, foreclosing reclamation. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, but minor therapy-speak in reflective summaries slightly dilutes peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elisions and image layers toward a Charged Poise closure where the protagonist leaves the label as a verdict, reweighting his erasure with conceptual cost of perpetual listening; orientation anchors early in docks and containers. Causality holds via textural density shifts, like gathering scraps leading to the mechanic's reveal, but one ellipsis in the poisoning backstory feels unmotivated without tighter linkage to the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The port city's towering containers constrain choices as a memory palace and hiding spot, charging the final confrontation with spatial pressure; sensory details like oily constellations and clanks are vivid, POV-filtered, and evolve causally, mirroring internal erasure. Micro-setting of the label and crates directly shapes the closure by enabling the verdict drop. Idiom matches the locale without caricature, and details integrate into action without stalling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming erased history tightens through deepening fragments, culminating in the widow confrontation that forecloses full reclamation with felt cost of namelessness; under Textural lens, cadence shifts reweight options via the label's return. One meaningful deepening occurs as overheard stories narrow to the personal poisoning, but coincidence in the mechanic's knowledge slightly complicates without fully resolving. Agency in endurance crystallizes stance, though moral calculus feels oblique.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of erased histories emerges organically from fragments and bureaucracy's fiction, resisting tidy morals through ambiguity in the widow's choice; the final image of tides layering stories offers resonant repricing without statement. Subtext in silences and labels deepens complexity, eliciting lingering unease over identity's texture. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality, but one abstract reflection on filtering reality echoes theme too directly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in sieved reality and rope-like memories, modulating rhythm under pressure; purposeful compression teaches pattern early, paying off in closure's poise. Dialogue is sparse but natural, subtext-driven, like the mechanic's sideways look advancing irony. Prose texture is rhythmic and voice-motivated, with non-standard phrasing legible and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in tidal cadences without loops; metaphors like oily constellations propel atmosphere without muddle, though one mixed vehicle ("fingertips taste bitter") slightly jars in a peak beat. Clarity holds with strong verbs and no artifacts touching closure; final line recharges motifs effectively. Information advances multi-job lines, but minor scaffold in reflective blocks adds slight drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bureaucratic death and port labyrinth transforms ghost tropes through specific fragments and tidal rhythms, feeling inevitable in the listener's stasis; risk in lyric elision heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generics, with non-obvious angle on memory as texture. Core premise commits fully, but proximity to existential wanderer archetypes caps ingenuity slightly.</comment>
