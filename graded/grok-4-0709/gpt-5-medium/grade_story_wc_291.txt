<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's face-blindness and methodical nature drive concrete micro-choices, like lancing the silt with rebar, revealing embodied contradictions in perception without stock phrasing; however, diagnostic labels like "Prosopagnosia" slightly edge into therapy-speak, though they anchor the trait effectively. Interior conflict shows in tracing absences, aligning actions with motives that intensify toward the painting's creation. The final renunciation of full knowledge earns stasis with felt cost in unresolved sorrow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, textural density builds through layered discoveries like the ribbon and phone case, leading to a Conceptual Repricing in the painting and letter that reweights empathy with conceptual cost; orientation anchors early in the quarry mist. Closure lands on-page with resonant reconfiguration via the woman's letter awakening dormant empathy. One meaningful cadence shift suffices, though ellipsis in the party's reconstruction feels slightly unmotivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The shadowed quarry in mist vividly anchors sensory details, constraining choices like lancing the silt and finding objects that charge the final image; micro-setting of the ribbon and rebar integrates into action, mirroring internal fog. Tone tensions the hush with purposeful ambiguity, evolving causally. Environment pressures the methodical search, charging closure without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of awakening empathy through cold case tightens via discoveries like the wrong-colored ribbon, deepening knowledge under Textural lens with one meaningful shift; cost is felt in grief's rise, though oblique. Agency in lancing and painting crystallizes stance, but coincidence in findings slightly complicates without fully resolving. Moral calculus sharpens in unifying opposites, foreclosing easy resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of awakening empathy through unifying opposites emerges organically from particulars like the ribbon's twist and Mara's gentleness, culminating in resonant final image of the painting's bridge without stated moral. Subtext in objects' memories invites reflection on absence. Emotional aftereffect lingers in forgiveness letters, embracing complexity without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters through face-blind bias, with rhythmic prose modulating via short, hushed sentences in mist; patterned elision in reflections is taught early and pays off at closure. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; POV stable in first-person, with purposeful compression heightening texture. Prose texture in metaphors like "bowl of breath" feels voice-motivated and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with metaphors doing double work, like "grief also rises when pierced," advancing atmosphere and theme; rhythm varies naturally, though some figurative stacking in quarry description borders on muddle without harming clarity. No major loops or artifacts; propulsion strong in lancing beat. Final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of face-blind detective with textural cold case exploration feels inevitable, transforming tropes through unifying opposites method; risk in poetic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Bold commitment to ambiguity in closure avoids hedging, with non-obvious angle on empathy awakening. Proximity check clears, as images like ribbon's kink personalize archetypes.</comment>
