<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to reforge the bond with Mira is clear and intensifies through embodied reluctance, culminating in the earned choice to become a passage with visible cost in losing plain speech. Interiority is concrete and contradictory, shown in the tide pulling at ribs where Mira pressed her thumbs, revealing values under pressure. However, the beasts feel more atmospheric than crucibles for character revelation, slightly limiting depth in relationships.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural, with patterns of scents and images building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist becomes a passage, reweighting grief with conceptual cost of voice loss. Orientation anchors early in the orchard under moonlight, and closure lands on-page with felt reluctance and acceptance, though the metamorphosis feels more poetic accrual than tight causal chain. The final image of the bond humming as a quiet star provides legible before/after with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fairy-tale orchard under permanent moonlight is vividly specific, with apples shining like moons and roots as treaty sites, constraining choices like laying the fortune slip and charging the final sap-climbing image. Sensory details are purposeful, filtered through POV bias toward scents and breaths, evolving causally as the orchard exhales and beasts approach. Environment pressures the metamorphosis, making it indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reforging the bond escalates through accumulative pressure of scents and reluctance, deepening to a meaningful tightening in choosing metamorphosis with legible cost of voice and solitude. Agency drives the conjuring and acceptance, foreclosing plain speech while reweighting options under the textural lens. Coincidence in Mira's appearance complicates but doesn't resolve, though stakes occasionally feel abstract amid metaphors.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of grief and bonds beyond death emerges organically through spices as metaphors for shared traits, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in silences and implications, like the fortune's revision, invites reflection on change's cost. Emotional aftereffect is concrete, avoiding sentimentality via complex ambiguity in the protagonist's refraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature in scent-focused, poetic noticing, like naming spices eyes-closed, and rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscurity. Lyric compression and patterned elision (e.g., braided air unfurling) are taught early and paid off at closure. Mira's sparse dialogue carries subtext, advancing the bond via implication.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and high information density in metaphors like "throats like bowls," advancing atmosphere without loops. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, though occasional overwriting in peak beats (e.g., stacked spice lists) slightly muddles momentum. No artifacts obscure closure, and final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of beast whispering via breathing grammar and spice-conjuring transforms fairy-tale tropes into a fresh angle on grief, with risk-taking in lyric structure heightening stakes without gimmickry. The premise of metamorphosis as refraction feels inevitable, committing to implications like borrowed wolf breaths. Emotional specificity in cosmic intimacies avoids generics, making the vision singular.</comment>
