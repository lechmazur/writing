<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to revive a shared dream with Mira is clear and rooted in entangled grief, intensifying through micro-choices like drumming rhythms that reveal a hierarchy of values with felt cost in carrying donors' fragments. Interiority is concrete via embodied images like "ribs hollowed like flutes," showing contradictory impulses of rebellion and acceptance without therapy-speak. The quietly rebellious trait drives actions under pressure, culminating in an earned stasis where flaws complicate but honor the broadened self, as in promising to tap donors' names at dawn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and cadence shifts, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final awakening with conceptual cost of integrating donors' lives. Orientation anchors early in the research wing at night, with deliberate poetic disorientation serving closure by charging the lagoon bridge. Closure lands on-page with Mira's eyes opening, reweighting entanglement as a bridge, though one minor ellipsis in treatment effects slightly softens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vividly specific, with sensory details like trembling chords and gold dust filtering through the narrator's urgency, constraining choices by translating rhythms into bridges. The auric lagoon under starlight charges the final image, mirroring internal entanglement and evolving causally to hold the shared dream. Micro-setting of rails and gravel affects action tactilely, with starlight tasting of letters heightening atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of untangling grief escalates texturally through density of spliced memories, deepening in the crack where foreign scenes erupt, forcing a trade-off to carry them for Mira's awakening. Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful cadence shift narrows options with felt cost in broadened identity, as when the net sings and teaches expansion. Agency in drumming and pressing the crack crystallizes stance, though coincidence of monitors echoing slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of entangled memories as love's shape emerges organically from images like the braid tugging and lagoon ripples, resisting tidy resolution by embracing donors' fragments with ambiguity. Subtext in gestures like tapping winter rhythms invites reflection on grief's cost, culminating in a resonant final image of drumming to teach time without stated moral. The ending reweights the premise non-literally, as Mira's nod blesses strangers, eliciting honest aftereffect through complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic compression like "hush of the universe inhaling," modulating rhythm under pressure without head-hopping. Purposeful elision in dream-like sequences is taught early and pays off at closure, with syntax reflecting the mind's entanglement. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; voice texture in word choice and patterned diction remains consistent and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through multi-job lines like "the garden heard intentions the way a seashell hears the ocean," varying rhythm naturally without loops. Figurative language is controlled, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the bridge crossing, though one mixed metaphor ("light tasting of unread letters") slightly strains. Clarity and propulsion hold, with final line resolving by recharging motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes experimental treatment with sound-based dreaming in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming grief tropes through specific images like whale letters and auroral sorrow. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable as drumming inverts cuffs into ceremony. Originality shines in the garden's instrumentality, committing to implications without retreat.</comment>
