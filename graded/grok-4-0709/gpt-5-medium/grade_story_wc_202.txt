<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to honor overlooked histories is clear and intensifies through sensory, embodied choices, like holding the lens to reveal coordinates, showing contradictory impulses of stillness amid movement. Interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions embodied in scents and tugs, avoiding stock phrasing. The secondary painter applies pressure via shrugs and nods, forcing the name's return with a felt cost in the eternal instant. The final renunciation of purchase earns stasis by confronting hidden absence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, density builds through layered images and pattern breaks, culminating in a Charged Poise closure where the name surfaces and the scene quits drowning, with conceptual cost in swallowed worlds and borrowed lungs. Orientation anchors who (translator), where (market above rooftops), and when (dusk) by line 2. Persistent lens holds without contradiction, with intuition's anchors constraining tactics. The final image reconfigures meaning with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The alchemist's market is vividly specific with sighing bridges, chiming stalls, and traded thunder, filtering through POV bias to mirror internal translation. Sensory details balance senses purposefully, like saffron light and salt scents, constraining choices at the stall. The recurring lens fragment as micro-setting charges the final image by pressing against the canvas, evolving causally. Tone tensions the ethereal with tangible tugs, supporting theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of recovering the name signals early and deepens via lens interaction, narrowing options through fissures and coordinates under Textural lens. One meaningful intensification forces stance crystallization as the child recognizes patience, with felt cost in borrowed sight and market tilt. Agency in speaking and writing the name crystallizes with trade-off of irrelevance to price. Coincidence of light catch complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of honoring overlooked histories emerges organically from images like hidden child in brushstrokes and waves lifting toward absence, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the painter's shrug. Subtext in gestures and silences, like the lens tasting light, invites reflection on tangible memories. The final image of tied sailcloth offers resonant, non-literal repricing of anonymity without stating a moral. Emotional aftereffect lingers through patience's lean, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with perceptual signature in selective noticing of pigments and salts, modulating rhythm with emotional intensity like braided wind. Patterned diction and elision teach early and pay off at closure, remaining legible. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances via shrugs and laughs distinguishing idioms. Prose texture reflects focalizer's mind, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like flutes to oars, advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold; sentences multitask via metaphors like unsellable truth. Figurative language coheres without muddle, even in peaks, with strong verbs and specific nouns. No artifacts obscure closure; final line recharges motifs cleanly. Read-aloud flows naturally, varying structures purposefully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemist market and between-worlds translation transforms tropes through specific details like zeroed maps and resin tastes, feeling inevitable. Bold risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise. Emotional specificity in recovered names avoids generics. Non-obvious angle on memory and absence coheres as singular vision.</comment>
