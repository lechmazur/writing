<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to translate a dying language is clear and intensifies through embodied actions like pressing the diamond and building listeners, revealing contradictory impulses in ignoring the curse's fear while offering his name as cost. Interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions embodied in pulses like "patient rain" and a "ringing cavity," avoiding stock phrasing. The meaningful endurance as caretaker forecloses paths with felt cost, shown in the loss of his travel-name at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned echoes and textural density, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the canyon becomes a school, with conceptual cost in the protagonist's lost name and ongoing tending. Orientation anchors who (storyteller), where (canyon of bone towers), and when (dusk) by the first line, serving the accumulative payoff. Closure lands on-page with undeniable pressure, as the final image reweights the language's death into revival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The canyon of endless echoes and bone towers is vividly specific, with sensory details like "rasp like bark scraped by winter" filtered through POV bias, constraining choices like climbing ridges and aligning the diamond. Environment charges the final image, where rain scores rock into shelter, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Micro-setting of the echo-tunnel evolves causally, pressuring tactics and enabling the language's revival.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of salvaging the dying language signals early and deepens through textural accumulation, with a meaningful cadence shift when the protagonist offers his name, narrowing options and crystallizing stance with visible cost. Pressure coheres under the lens, forcing renunciation that forecloses his travel identity. The diamond's curse adds ethical calculus, sharpening the peak choice without coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of language preservation amid erosion emerges organically from images like worn words and echo-braille, culminating in a resonant final image where the canyon sings, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like feeding the curse dead names invites reflection on curses as unpunctuated contracts. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars, embracing complexity in the protagonist's flawed endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, textured noticing like "wind stitched a grammar," maintaining rhythmic control under pressure. Patterned elision and non-standard phrasing are taught early and pay off at closure, enhancing legibility. No dialogue present, so not evaluated; voice modulates intentionally with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with rhythmic variety, as in the varying sentence lengths building to "a flood of textures became choir," advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, like "curse is only a contract without punctuation," propelling momentum. Minor overwriting in dense metaphors doesn't obscure closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes echoes, cursed gems, and bird patterns into a fresh angle on linguistic preservation, feeling inevitable through grounded choices like harnessing swifts. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes like cursed objects into organic elements. Bold vision coheres as singular, with the echo-tunnel offering non-obvious ingenuity in translating texture.</comment>
