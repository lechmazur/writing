<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to mend the orchard and bridge generational wisdom is clear and intensifies through embodied grief over the absent daughter, culminating in the ritual's emotional cost. Interior contradictions shine in the unopened tin and reluctance to let go, with Mira's feisty presence applying secondary pressure that reveals the narrator's flaws without stock phrasing. The final endurance forecloses easy resolution with a felt relational cost, shown in the ribbon's knot holding "like an answer."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through patterned imagery of vows and fruit to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the falling leaves and breathing cathedral, with conceptual cost in persistent grief.

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned cathedral's rafters with lush orchard vividly anchor the scene, constraining choices like climbing for the ritual and charging the final image of falling vows. Sensory details, filtered through the narrator's quartz eye, evolve causally as sap runs and fruit lifts, mirroring internal release. The micro-setting of branches as ribs integrates action, with the environment pressuring the mending without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake in restoring the orchard and bridging wisdom tightens through the ritual's deepening, narrowing options as vows shed with a felt cost in the narrator's unresolved paternal ache. Under the Accumulative lens, pattern breaks in the shivering canopy reweight pressure without coincidence resolving it.

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of accidental wisdom emerges organically from shedding vows and persistent mending, resisting tidy morals through ambiguous bridges to the daughter. Subtext in the ribbon and tin invites reflection on grief's cost, with the final image of falling pages offering a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality, arising from concrete particulars like Mira's laugh finding cracks.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person voice maintains distinct perceptual signature through poetic, quartz-eye filtered observations, with rhythmic control in metaphors like "leaves loosened with little sighs."

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, multi-job sentences like "vows letting go the way grief sometimes does," varying rhythm without loops or scaffold.

Clarity holds in sequence and grammar, propelling to the resonant final line.</comment>
