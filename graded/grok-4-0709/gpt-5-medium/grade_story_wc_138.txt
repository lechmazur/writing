<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The immortal's motivation to explore after goodbye is clear and intensifies through embodied interiority, with contradictory impulses in refusing endings yet seeking purpose; Lio's presence as a crucible forces a softening of refusal, earning the closure with felt cost in memories paid. Some stock immortal boredom feels lightly generic, but micro-choices under storm pressure reveal specific values. The final renunciation of pure boredom, reconfigured into edged purpose, is earned by prior accumulation of imagery and intrigue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned imagery (hushed thunder, prisms) with density increasing to a pattern break at the corridor's appearance, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where goodbye becomes a blueprint with conceptual cost in revised curse and borrowed purpose. Orientation anchors early in the escondite during the storm. The ending reweights the stake legibly, with persistent magnetic fields constraining tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite and solar storm are vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like humming obsidian and braided auroras filtered through the immortal's dimensional awareness, constraining choices like coaxing space and charging the final image of pacified space. Atmosphere supports intrigue tone without overt symbolism. Micro-setting of the fragment and coils evolves causally, mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering after goodbye tightens through accumulative pressure of storm and mutiny, with a deepening at corridor entry forcing agency in paying memories; cost is legible in softened forgiveness and revised curse, reweighting options under the lens. Coincidence of Lio's arrival complicates via intrigue without resolving. One meaningful intensification suffices, driven by protagonist's whisper to prisms.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of goodbye as ongoing infrastructure emerges organically from images like unsaid farewells and mended bridges, with subtext in prisms' exile and fragment's grin; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer reweighting parting as blueprint without moralizing. Ambiguity in forgiveness lingers meaningfully. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars like spent seed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, dimensionally aware noticing; voice texture in rhythmic metaphors like "hushed thunder" holds under pressure, teaching patterned elision early. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances plot, as in Lio's cynical nod and laughing forgiveness. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, high information in metaphors like "carefully polished knives" advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold; figurative language coheres without muddle, even in peak beats like spatial mutiny. Clarity holds in closure image of pocketed fragment. Zero artifacts touch the ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of immortality with spatial mutiny and magnetic confession transforms tropes through specific details like amulet's spirals and storm-bent veins; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable at closure's blueprint revelation. No derivative echoes; authenticity coheres in singular vision of borrowed purpose.</comment>
