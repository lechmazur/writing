<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to send the message is clear and rooted in her loss, intensifying to compel the sacrificial weaving; interiority is concrete through embodied weaving actions, though emotions lean toward poetic summary rather than raw contradiction. The final sacrifice reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost, earning stasis through devotion. Strengths in flawed dedication without hedging; weakness in occasional stock wistfulness that borders on label-speak, as in "stoically sparkling eyes."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery of unraveling and weaving, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara dissolves with legible cost; orientation anchors early in the orchard. Closure lands on-page with the message soaring and her essence fading, reweighting the stake. Strength in held lens without contradiction; minor slip in mid-story ellipsis that slightly softens causality but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The forgotten orchard in bamboo forest is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like creaking stalks and stone apples mirroring Elara's isolation and sacrifice; it constrains choices by providing the box and sap, charging the final image of her dissolution into whispers. Micro-setting of the loom under the tree evolves causally, guiding action. Exceptional integration without static repetition; environment recharges the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of bridging the chasm to her daughter tightens through weaving, with one meaningful deepening as sacrifice shortens her life, narrowing options under Textural lens; agency in renunciation forecloses her path with felt cost. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolving it. Strength in moral calculus of love versus existence; minor weakness in abstract stakes that feel less visceral at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of sacrificial preservation emerges organically from weaving memories and the unraveling tapestry, with subtext in images like the amber bead symbolizing trapped hope; final image offers resonant, non-literal repricing of time and loss without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity. Strength in avoiding tidy morals; purposeful ambiguity enriches without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent third-person close POV with lyrical texture in syntax and rhythm, teaching patterned elision early through whispers and echoes; perceptual signature biases toward wistful memory. No dialogue, so policy applies. Strength in modulated distance; weakness in occasional register drift to elevated diction, like "latent sacrifice blooming," jarring under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with vivid images advancing atmosphere, but paraphrase loops like repeated "unraveling tapestry" and "raveling silence" create minor redundancy without payoff; information density high yet momentum drags in mid-weaving description. No major artifacts touch closure. Strength in final line's resonant image; weakness in mixed metaphors, like threads as ghosts and bones, slightly muddling peak beats (−0.6 applied).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of loom-weaving with time rifts and puzzle edges transforms familiar loss tropes through specific, organic fantasy; risk in lyrical structure heightens stakes without gimmickry (+0.3). Perspective feels memorable via Elara's devotion. Strength in non-obvious angle on memory preservation; no close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
