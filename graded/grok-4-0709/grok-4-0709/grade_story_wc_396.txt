<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to map empathy onto action is clear and intensifies through her intuitive shadows, compelling the reconstitution; interiority is concrete with embodied contradictions, like shadows whispering amid calm. However, some stock phrasing like "courageous anomaly" feels label-only without deeper embodiment in crisis. The final resolve shows earned endurance with felt cost of intervening in divides.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, mirror glimpses build density and cadence shift to reform the orb, leading to Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost of thawed divides; orientation anchors early in lighthouse orchard. Closure reweights options via the tool, but some ellipsis in shadow mechanics feels unmotivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting of lighthouse orchard above shifting ice floes is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices like ascending stairs and mirroring internal empathy with frozen apples; it charges the final image of glistening melt. Sensory details are selective, filtered through Elara's bias, evolving causally with groans below.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of awaiting Council's reply tightens through reconstitution, with one meaningful deepening via mirror visions narrowing options to action; agency in endurance forecloses passivity with felt cost. Pressure coheres accumulatively, but stakes remain somewhat abstract without visceral test in climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of mapping empathy onto action emerges organically from mirror glimpses transforming sorrows into strategies, inviting reflection on compassion's tangibility without moralizing; final image offers resonant, non-literal answer by orb as living map. Subtext in shadows and frozen blooms adds complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature in shadow-laced intuition, but dense syntax occasionally obscures under pressure; no dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets. Elision in visions is patterned and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high density, but overwriting in peak beats like stacked metaphors ("shadows whispered intuitions, calm and insistent") muddles clarity without payoff; some paraphrase loops, e.g., repeated empathy-to-action phrasing. Rhythm varies, but template cadence in mirror sequences dulls propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy elements like shadow-laced peacekeeper in ice orchard transforms tropes through specific empathy-mapping; risk in accumulative structure heightens stakes organically. Core premise feels inevitable in hindsight via reconstitution's ingenuity.</comment>
