<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to salvage purity drives her actions consistently, with embodied emotion in the chill piercing her gloves and visions flooding her, revealing contradictory impulses between exposure and careful weaving; however, interiority occasionally slips into abstract labels like "fragile portals" without deeper embodiment under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered whispers and dream analyses to a resonant reconfiguration in the final sigh of relief and salvaged soul, with conceptual cost legible in the careful truth-weaving; orientation anchors early in the glacier descent, and closure lands on-page with felt reconfiguration, though one beat feels summarized rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The candle-lit shrine in glacier ice is vividly specific, with glistening walls and frozen driftwood constraining Elara's movements and charging the final image of brighter starlight; sensory details like fogging visor and flickering flames integrate into action, mirroring her ethereal tone without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of salvaging purity tightens once through the visions deepening knowledge of injustice, under Accumulative lens, with conceptual cost in descendants' fragile peace; however, pressure remains introspective without a sharper on-page reversal or visible trade-off, making escalation feel accumulative but not intensely narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of fragile connections between living and dead emerges organically from dream cameos and the globe's lens, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the salvaged soul without moralizing; subtext in ghostly pleas adds complexity, though some direct statements like "windows of connection" border on assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual bias in ethereal whispers and borrowed starlight, voice textured by poetic rhythm; however, some elisions like summarized dream accounts feel untaught, and prose occasionally drifts into elevated register mismatched to crisis urgency in the visions flood.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and vivid images like "frozen tears under the flicker of wax flames," with high density in shrine descriptions; yet paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "borrowed starlight" without progression) and mixed metaphors (e.g., "thawed wonder" in warped glass) dull momentum in the central chamber beat, though not obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of wreck-diving with ghost whispering in a glacial shrine feels fresh, transforming tropes through specific dream analyses and careful truth-weaving; risk in lyric accumulation heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, making the premise non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
