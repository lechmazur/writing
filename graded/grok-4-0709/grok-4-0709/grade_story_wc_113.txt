<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to unravel the ghost's code is clear and intensifies through his ethereal pull, driving choices like retrieving the program and playing discord; interiority is concrete via embodied sensations like itching fingers and attuned heart, with contradictory impulses in disrupting silence. However, emotions sometimes lean toward poetic abstraction rather than raw embodiment, slightly softening peak stress. The final transformation feels earned by prior causality, with a felt cost in leaving the inspired state behind.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure accumulates density through rippling water, flickering light, and emerging symbols, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the resolved hush with conceptual cost of transformation; orientation anchors early in the flooded theater. Closure lands on-page with the melody's revelation and Elias's exit, reweighting the stake. One meaningful cadence shift suffices, though causality feels more implied than chained in spots.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The flooded opera house with flickering lanterns is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices like wading and illuminating the program; sensory details reflect Elias's bias, with water and light mirroring internal longing. Environment charges the final image of unstruck chords, evolving causally with ripples from his playing. Micro-setting of the pit and cello integrates action tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling the code signals early and deepens via the water-damaged revelations, with one meaningful tightening in the discordant playing that narrows options and reveals the refrain; cost is felt in the spectral approval and his transformation. Pressure coheres texturally, forcing stance crystallization without coincidence resolving it. Agency in disruption earns the peak, though stakes remain somewhat ethereal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of in-between spaces emerges organically from events like the hush and unstruck chords, inviting reflection on life-echo bridges without tidy morals; subtext in silence and ripples adds complexity. Final image of the resolved hush offers a resonant, non-literal answer reweighting the premise. Emotional aftereffect lingers through the wordless conversation's ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Elias's attuned senses to gaps and echoes; prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, lyrical syntax modulating with intensity. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision of spoken words fits the wordless tone, taught early and paid off at closure. Psychic distance shifts intentionally in peak disruption without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "drowned dreams" without loops; rhythm varies naturally, though some figurative stacks in the revelation beat border on overwriting. Clarity holds, with strong verbs and specific details propelling to the crescendo. Final line recharges motifs effectively, but minor scaffold in repetitive "in-between" phrasing slightly dulls momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghostly code revealed by flood and discord transforms opera tropes into a fresh ethereal puzzle; risk in wordless, textural structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional complexity in inspiration's cost feels authentic and inevitable. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on remnant bridges, cohering as singular vision.</comment>
