<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find unused love is clear and intensifies through her psychometry, but interiority relies on abstract labels like "burned quietly within her" without embodied contradictions under pressure. The final realization feels unearned, lacking micro-choices that reveal value hierarchies with visible cost. Strengths in consistent traits like spatial imagination enabling visions, yet emotions remain performed rather than layered with irrationality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered visions and imagery to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Elara realizes unused love's storage, with conceptual cost in her archived affections; orientation anchors early in the booth. However, causality is associative rather than tightening knowledge, with visions summarizing without motivated ellipsis. The ending reweights the stake but lacks a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The vintage projection booth is vividly detailed with dust motes and reels mirroring Elara's quest, constraining her actions by providing the film strip as a key object. Sensory specifics like projector heat and faint bulb glow integrate into her psychometry, charging the final image of the humming projector. Tone tensions the introspective atmosphere effectively without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding unused love signals early but escalates minimally under Accumulative lens via textural density in visions, with one deepening in the map revelation; however, pressure remains abstract without narrowing options or forcing trade-offs. No visible cost alters tactics, and the resolution crystallizes via insight without agency-driven reversal. Coincidence of finding the film strip complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming unused love emerges through images like forgotten reels and lyrics, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer in the final symphony metaphor without moralizing. Subtext in Harlan's letters adds complexity, inviting reflection on archived affections. However, epiphanies feel asserted rather than earned from struggle, bordering on pseudo-profundity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual bias in spatial visions, and prose texture is distinct with rhythmic metaphors like "dust motes danced like silent specters." However, register drifts into elevated diction mismatched to crisis, such as "liminal hour when melodies long silenced stirred," dulling immediacy. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; elision in visions is patterned but not fully taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Prose has high density in atmospheric images but suffers from paraphrase loops, like repeating "unused love" concepts in adjacent lines without advancement, and mixed metaphors like "hushed thunder" contradicting itself. Sentence rhythm varies, but template cadence in vision sequences, e.g., "She realized... She decided... In her mind's...," drags momentum in the climax. Overwriting obscures clarity at peak, such as "profound quietude laced with electric intensity."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Ingenuity in synthesizing psychometry with cinematic relics for a fresh take on unused love, with the film strip as a transformed trope charging the closure. However, premise echoes familiar mystical discovery templates without bold risk, feeling prompt-stitched rather than organic. Emotional specificity in Harlan's letters adds authenticity, but overall synthesis lacks non-obvious inevitability.</comment>
