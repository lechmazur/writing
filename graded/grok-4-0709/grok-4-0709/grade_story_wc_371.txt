<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to seek absolution through gentle acts is clear and rooted in traits like noticing creeping normality, intensifying to compel his guerrilla gardening; interiority shows embodied emotion in his contemplation of guilt, but diagnostic labels like "creeping normality noticer" and "heuristically gentle" feel like therapy-speak, reducing specificity. The final renunciation of past apathy earns stasis with felt cost in unearthed guilt, avoiding stock epiphanies. No second character, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned imagery of decay and revival, with orientation anchored early in the overgrown courtyard; closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration via the mosaic unearthing and garden blooms, reweighting stakes with conceptual cost of guilt redeemed, though the shift feels more declarative than deeply causal. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, but some ellipsis in backstory lacks tight linkage to present tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard is vividly specific, with vines and cracked fountains mirroring Elias's internal decay; sensory details like chamomile scent and bread's yeast integrate into action, constraining choices like targeting the mound, and the environment charges the final image of blooming revelation. Micro-setting of the tea house pressures his sanctuary motif effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncloaking sacred in ordinary escalates texturally through density of motifs like bread and seeds, with one meaningful deepening in mosaic discovery forcing stance crystallization; cost is felt in guilt confrontation, but pressure remains somewhat static without sharper narrowing of options. Coincidence of the mound complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of redemption in mundane acts emerges from images like crumbling bread into mosaic, inviting reflection on normalized decay without tidy morals; subtext in gentle invocations adds complexity, but some direct statements like "sacred ordinary unveiled" border on assertion. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer to absolution, reweighting premise with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Elias's biased noticing of erosions; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, lyric diction, but some register drift into academic terms like "heuristic" jars. No dialogue, so ignore those bullets; elision in reflections is patterned and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and density, with vivid images like "vines strangled marble statues," but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated decay motifs in adjacent sentences) and template cadence in reflective blocks dull momentum; figurative language muddles slightly in peak unearthing without harming closure clarity. Information advances atmosphere, but some scaffold redundancies persist.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of guerrilla gardening with absolution in ruins feels fresh, transforming decay tropes through specific motifs like vanished bakery bread; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes organically, but premise echoes familiar redemption arcs without bold subversion.</comment>
