<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in legacy, intensifying through exploration to compel the discovery; interiority is concrete with embodied emotions like trembling hands during the diary piecing. Internal conflict shows in her burden mirroring Silas's regrets, leading to an earned renunciation of solitary weight. Strength lies in the micro-choice to gather fragments, revealing values with felt cost at the realization. Minor weakness in stock phrasing like "heart quickened" slightly dilutes specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through perceptual layers and discoveries with coherent pattern breaks, like emerging into the study; orientation anchors early in the overgrown ruins. Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing as the burden lightens into a shared narrative, with felt emotional cost in the sighing corridor. One meaningful deepening suffices, but ellipsis in family lore feels slightly unmotivated without tighter linkage to tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with ivy-veiled passage and flooded highlands constraining movement and mirroring isolation; sensory details like decay scent and dripping foliage reflect POV bias. Environment charges the final image by releasing echoes, evolving causally from invasion to shroud. Strength in how the manor preserves secrets, directly enabling discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of lightening legacy burden tightens through the narrowing passage and diary find, with one meaningful deepening under textural lens reweighting options. Agency in pressing on despite tangles forecloses ease, with felt cost in emotional release. Weakness: pressure feels accumulative but lacks a sharper trade-off, as coincidence of finding the negative complicates without fully escalating.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of inherited regret and redemption emerges organically from discoveries, with subtext in shadowed laughter and walls' sighs inviting reflection on shared burdens. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer by rewriting narratives, avoiding tidy morals. Strength in complexity mirroring struggles, but some direct statements like "shared narrative to rewrite" border on assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature in attuned vibrations and biased noticing of echoes; no head-hopping or unmotivated elision. Prose texture distinct in rhythmic syntax mirroring resonances, modulating with intensity. No dialogue present, so policy applies; strength in consistent free indirect style during the negative viewing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with momentum, varying rhythm in descriptive beats, but paraphrase loops like repeated ivy tangles and echo motifs create minor redundancy without payoff. Information density high in discovery scene, with strong verbs; however, figurative muddle in "ghosts" and "sentinels" slightly clutters peak pressure. No major artifacts touch closure, but template cadence in action sequences dulls propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing echo cartography with walls' dreams in a post-climate world, transforming exploration tropes through specific perceptual stakes. Fresh angle on legacy via negative strip feels inevitable, with risk in lyric accumulations heightening resonance without gimmickry. Strength in the vow to chart redemptions, a non-obvious reconfiguration.</comment>
