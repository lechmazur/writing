<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in contrasting honesty with father's deceit, shown through contradictory impulses like rejecting charm yet using the ink to bend ethics; interiority is concrete with embodied doubts dissolving, but some stock phrasing like "burning need" slightly flattens emotional specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages from discovery to breach, anchoring orientation early in the prep room; closure delivers a decisive change in transforming the legacy with felt ethical cost, though minor redundancy in reflective memories slightly pads the structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like embalming fluid and refrigeration hum build a purposeful atmosphere of deathly vitality; the prep room constrains choices and charges the final casket closure, mirroring internal reconfiguration without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of balancing legacies escalates causally through the timed window and ethical calculations, narrowing options with agency-driven tightening; cost of moral compromise is legible in the ink's use, though slightly abstracted in the resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of redeeming deceit through equitable mathematics emerges organically from events and images like the ink pot, without direct statements; the ending provides a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration of scales balancing, inviting reflection on fairness with purposeful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature biased toward equations and clarity; rhythmic, metaphorical prose modulates effectively under pressure, though some elevated diction like "deathly vitality" feels occasionally unmotivated for the voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose advances with high density and varied rhythm, using strong verbs and specific images; however, paraphrase loops in room descriptions and dense figuratives like "quiet flame" create minor scaffold, slightly dulling momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ingenious blend of magical ink with ethical hacking in a funeral setting transforms con artist tropes through mathematical fairness; the premise offers a fresh angle that heightens stakes organically, with risk-taking in hybrid realism charging the reconfiguration without gimmickry.</comment>
