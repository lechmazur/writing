<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation rooted in grief over Clara drives consistent analytic actions, with embodied emotions in his whispers to Mort and snow globe interaction; interior contradiction shows in clinging to regrets while seeking release, culminating in earned stasis at ascension. Flaw in occasional stock phrasing like "heart quickened" slightly dilutes specificity, but micro-choices under pressure reveal values with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern of discoveries building to conceptual repricing in the note's revelation and Elias's realization; closure lands on-page with felt cost of releasing grief, reweighting loss as equilibrium. Orientation anchors early in submersible at sea depths; one meaningful deepening suffices, though ellipsis in untangling feels slightly soft without stricter causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sunken library vividly detailed with warped shelves and preserved silence, constraining choices via robotic arms and floodlights; it charges final image as Elias powers down lights, letting shadows claim it, mirroring release. Sensory hierarchy filters through Elias's analytic bias, evolving causally with actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding letting go tightens through globe discovery and untangling, deepening via Morse code and note to force stance crystallization with emotional cost; under Accumulative lens, pattern break in hypnotic flakes reweights grief. Coincidence of globe's presence complicates without resolving; one intensification suffices, but abstract stakes feel less visceral at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of letting go emerges through snow globe's flakes and note's surrender metaphor, resonating in final image without moralizing; subtext in wires as attachment vectors invites reflection on grief's physics. Earned from particulars like Earhart echo, avoiding platitudes; final reconfiguration offers non-literal answer reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stable, with perceptual signature in analytic observations like "particles clinging, then drifting"; voice texture distinct in rhythmic, introspective prose modulating with intensity. Murmurs to Mort carry subtext and advance insight; minor filter verbs in peak beats slightly dull immediacy but serve voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose dense with purposeful metaphors like snow globe storm mirroring turmoil, propulsion strong in action beats; rhythm varies, but occasional paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated grief dissections) and mixed metaphors in "deep current" strike dilute momentum. No major artifacts touch closure; high density in library reveal elevates.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Earhart lore with grief via sunken library and espionage globe transforms tropes; risk in metaphorical physics heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at note's reveal. Emotional specificity in surrender avoids generics; bold conceptual integrity commits without retreat.</comment>
