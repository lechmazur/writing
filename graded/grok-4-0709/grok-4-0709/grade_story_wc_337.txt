<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to ground spirits through unraveling is clear and intensifies with her revealed guilt, showing embodied contradictory impulses like steady hands amid lucid unrest; the final renunciation of her secret earns the closure with visible emotional cost, as in her trembling hands and exhaled relief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered revelations and knot-unraveling beats, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the net dissolves and spirits settle with felt cost to Elara's unrest; orientation anchors early in the prism sanctuary, and causality holds without breaks, though minor redundancy in hush descriptions slightly dilutes density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary under starlight is vividly specific, with prismatic light filtering sensory details that heighten unrest and charge the final mending burst; it constrains Elara's ritual choices and evolves causally, mirroring her internal turmoil, as in shadows that "seemed to breathe."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grounding spirits escalates accumulatively through knot-unraveling deepenings that narrow options and reveal betrayal, driven by Elara's agency with unmistakable cost in her exhumed guilt; one meaningful tightening suffices, but stakes occasionally feel abstract until the spectral voices rush.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of exhuming buried secrets for peace emerges organically from ritual actions and revelations without direct statements, offering resonant ambiguity in Elara's family shame; the final image of dispersing silence reweights the premise non-literally, avoiding tidy morals, though subtext in whispers could deepen further.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in prismatic filters and unrest, modulating rhythm under pressure; purposeful compression in lyric descriptions is taught early and pays off at closure, but occasional register drift into elevated diction like "lucid unrest that churned" slightly jars the voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid images like "whispering rainbows," varying rhythm effectively; however, paraphrase loops around "accumulated silence" and "interlaced hush" create minor redundancy in peak beats, dulling momentum without obscuring closure, and some metaphors stack densely without full payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes ghostly restoration with prismatic fantasy in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming tropes through Elara's ancestral secret and ritual specificity; risk in accumulative structure heightens stakes organically, as in the betrayal reveal, feeling inevitable without gimmickry.</comment>
