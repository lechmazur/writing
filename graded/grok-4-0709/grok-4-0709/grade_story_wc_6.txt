<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to heal scars through compassion is clear and intensifies via the graft, with embodied emotions in her ritual actions mirroring her own burns. Interior conflict shows in her repurposing the father's coin, revealing contradictory impulses of legacy and rejection without stock epiphanies. The closure's endurance forecloses bitterness with felt cost in her warmed scars, though some diagnostic labels like "unyielding compassion" trend toward therapy-speak, slightly flattening complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, patterned elisions and image recurrences build to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the singing sapling reweights scars with conceptual cost, legible in the nomads' gathering and Elara's stance. Orientation anchors who (Elara), where (lagoon), and when (cloud migration) by the first paragraph, avoiding penalties. Backstory integrates via cues like the coin, tilting present choices without excess, but some ellipsis feels unmotivated, mildly softening causality at the graft's success.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and dunes constrain choices, supplying black sand that enriches soil and charges the final image of the singing tree. Sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, with kelp and clouds mirroring internal peace, evolving causally as light shifts. No anachronisms or inconsistencies, and the micro-setting of the sapling integrates action purposefully, though weather affects tone more than direct tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving scars can sing tightens through the graft's deepening symbolism, reweighting options with conceptual cost in the tree's melody under Accumulative lens. One meaningful cadence shift occurs as clouds cluster, forcing stance crystallization in the twilight song. Agency via renunciation of father's legacy forecloses paths with felt emotional price, but stakes remain somewhat abstract without visceral on-page tests beyond ritual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of renewal from wounds emerges organically through graft imagery and scar motifs, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer as the tree sings, reweighting prior trauma without moralizing. Subtext in the pierced coin implies blood ties and repurposed pain, inviting reflection on compassion's complexity. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality via concrete particulars like brine watering, though some overt symbolism borders on thematic echo in "scars can sing."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual signature in gracefully alert noticing, like wind hums and light shifts, modulating rhythm under pressure without head-hopping. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax and patterned diction, teaching lyric compression early for legibility at closure. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision of graft details pays off in the song, but occasional filter verbs like "she noticed" mildly dull immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and high density in images like "polished midnight," advancing atmosphere, but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated scar and cloud motifs without progression) create minor scaffold in mid-beats. Figurative language stacks in peak ritual without muddle, yet template cadence in "she [action], her [trait]" runs appear thrice, triggering -0.4. Clarity is strong with clean grammar, but overwriting in descriptive passages slightly drags momentum without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arson legacy and symbolic grafting transforms healing tropes through specific details like the drilled coin and volcanic sand, feeling inevitable in the singing scars. Emotional specificity in Elara's ritual avoids generics, with risk in lyric structure heightening thematic stakes via pattern. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on compassion, though echoes of redemptive nature motifs limit boldness.</comment>
