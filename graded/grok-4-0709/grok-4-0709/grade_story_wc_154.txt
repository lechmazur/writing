<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elena's motivation to graft meaning onto wounds drives her interaction with Amir, showing embodied emotion through her anesthetic haze and shrewd innocence that enables the decryption; however, interior contradictions feel summarized rather than simultaneous in scene, as in her lotus-hearted ache, which layers but doesn't fully contradict under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of mist and wounds toward a Conceptual Repricing in the poem's reveal, with felt cost in transformed ache; orientation anchors early in the atrium, but causality is loose with anesthetic drifting into dreamlike puzzle without tighter linkages narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight vividly filters light and clings to floors, constraining Elena's unsteady steps and charging the final hope bloom; sensory details like vine-draped arches mirror internal blurring, purposefully integrated without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Shared anxieties as dominant stake deepen texturally through decryption and coral sharing, with one meaningful cadence shift to hope; however, pressure remains abstract without a visible trade-off foreclosing options, as the resolution feels coincidental rather than agency-driven under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of turning scars into hope emerges organically from decryption and coral symbolism, culminating in resonant poem without moralizing; subtext in gestures like clutching the fragment invites reflection, but some overt statements like "grafting new meaning" border on direct assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stays stable with perceptual bias in Elena's shrewdly innocent eyes, and dialogue carries subtext in Amir's confession; however, prose texture drifts into elevated register mismatched to stress, as in anesthetic haze descriptions, dulling immediacy without taught pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety in mist imagery but suffers paraphrase loops, like repeated wound metaphors, and mixed similes like "whispered secrets" clashing with "lotus-hearted ache," obscuring closure clarity; information density is uneven with redundant emotional summaries in the final bloom.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of translator's decryption applied to child's cast transforms trope of healing in conflict zones, with brain coral as non-obvious motif charging resilience; however, premise echoes familiar refugee tales without bold risk-taking to subvert conventions.</comment>
