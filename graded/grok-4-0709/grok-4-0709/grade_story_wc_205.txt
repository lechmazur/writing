<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to reimagine the civilization is clear and rooted in his revolutionary past, intensifying through the discovery to a resonant spark, but interiority relies on poetic summaries rather than embodied contradictions in scene. Emotions are labeled as "burnished sorrow" without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, trending toward stock phrasing. The final renunciation of his defunct status feels earned by causality, yet flaws complicate choices more through reflection than on-page micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through poetic descriptions and temporal veils, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias glimpses redemption with felt conceptual cost in the final image. Orientation anchors early in the asteroid halls, avoiding debt. Causality holds via textural pattern breaks like the storm and shard examination, but some ellipsis in the discovery feels unmotivated, slightly weakening linkage to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting is vivid and purposeful, with gilded arches and temporal veils constraining Elias's quest and charging the final image as a "burnished mirror to his soul." Sensory details are selective, filtered through his poetic bias, and evolve with the storm, mirroring internal decay without overt symbolism. Micro-setting like the chamber sanctuary affects choices, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of resolving the archaeological dispute escalates through pattern break in the storm, deepening to reweight options with the shard's revelation, but cost feels more conceptual than viscerally felt on-page. One meaningful tightening occurs as the method shields from distortions, forcing stance crystallization. Pressure coheres but lacks a sharper trade-off in the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of reimagining oppressive histories emerges organically from events and motifs like the shard, offering resonant ambiguity without tidy morals, culminating in a non-literal answer via the final talisman image. Subtext in poetic verses and sorrow adds complexity, but some direct statements like "a fragile victory" border on thematic echo. Emotional aftereffect is concrete through kindred spirit recognition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in poetic noticing like "shimmering veils" and "frozen tears," modulating rhythm under storm pressure without head-hopping. Prose texture is distinct in lyrical syntax, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; elision pays off in the discovery beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and high density in images like "gilded arches twisted like forgotten sonnets," but paraphrase loops appear in repetitive sorrow motifs, and stacked metaphors in peak beats like the storm description muddle clarity without payoff. Information advances atmosphere, yet some scaffolding in reflective blocks drags momentum. No major artifacts touch closure, but template cadence in openings like "He was" and "This forsaken rock" deducts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes archaeological dispute with visible time in a fresh, poetic angle on lost revolutions, transforming tropes through specific shard use and temporal storms without gimmickry. Risk in lyric mode heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Emotional specificity avoids generics, but proximity to familiar sci-fi ruins echoes slightly untransformed.</comment>
