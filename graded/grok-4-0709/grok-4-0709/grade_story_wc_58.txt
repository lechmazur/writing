<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to understand healing through obituaries is clear and rooted in his wanderer traits, intensifying to compel the ritual projection; interiority is concrete in embodied sensations like the thread's pulse, but emotions lean toward abstract labels without strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the scene. The final quiet triumph feels earned by prior reflection, foreclosing ongoing pain with felt solitude cost. No second character, so relationship bullets ignored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through descriptive density and pattern of imagery leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where absences are reweighted as growth spaces, with conceptual cost of solitude legible in the final rose image; orientation anchors who (Elias), where (garden), when (after ship sails) by ~50 words. One meaningful cadence shift in the projection ritual tightens toward resonant reconfiguration. No causality breaks, but ellipsis in mental voyage feels motivated by the thread talisman.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The autumn garden setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like damp earth and whispering oaks filtered through Elias's melancholic POV, subtly mirroring his internal healing quest; environment constrains the ritual by providing isolation, charging the final image of lonesome splendor. Details evolve with fading light, affecting mood without stalling action. No occupational depth needed here.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of explaining Mira's absence signals early and deepens through the projection, under Accumulative/Textural lens via density increase in imagery that reweights emotional cost; one meaningful tightening in the thread's warming guides the ritual, but pressure remains internal and abstract, lacking a visible trade-off or foreclosure of options beyond solitude. Agency is renunciation of past with felt cost in the ether whisper, but coincidence of ship departure complicates without resolving. No multiple reversals required, but escalation feels static.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of absences as healing spaces emerges organically from the ritual and garden motifs, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the blooming rose image that reweights prior voids without moralizing; subtext in thread's symbolism and projected whisper invites reflection on reinvention's complexity. No overt statements, but some abstraction in "geography of healing" borders on pseudo-profundity. Emotional aftereffect is honest melancholy triumph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature in selective, poetic noticing of autumn hues and thread's texture, modulating rhythm with emotional intensity in the projection; prose texture is distinct in lyrical syntax, but some register drift into elevated diction feels unmotivated for Elias's wanderer voice. No dialogue, so those bullets ignored. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and high density in vivid images like "leaves drifted like forgotten promises," but overwriting in peak beats with stacked metaphors (e.g., oaks as cathedral ribs, thread as starlight) muddles clarity without payoff; paraphrase loops appear in repetitive healing geography descriptions, dulling momentum in the projection sequence. Clarity is maintained, but template cadence in sentence openings (e.g., multiple "he" starts) triggers deduction. Final line resolves with resonant image, but artifacts touch closure subtly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality in obituaries for the living and presence projection offers a fresh angle on loss and healing, synthesized organically with the thread talisman; risk-taking in lyric introspection heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the garden ritual. No close echoes of famous scenes, but premise borders on familiar wanderer trope without bolder subversion. Authenticity coheres in singular melancholic vision.</comment>
