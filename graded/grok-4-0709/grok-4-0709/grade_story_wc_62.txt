<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to discover grief's shape intensifies compellingly through his meditative actions and the ribbon ritual, with interior contradictions shown in his whirlwind calm, but emotions feel more labeled than embodied, as in the "calm torrent" of memories that lacks visceral contradiction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and deepenings like the ribbon unspooling and butterfly swirls, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where grief is reweighted as woven and shared with felt cost in Elias's transformed obsession; orientation anchors early in the greenhouse at dusk, though some elisions feel more poetic than pressured.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse at dusk is vividly specific with twisting vines, fluttering butterflies, and exotic plants that constrain and mirror Elias's meditative circling, charging the final image of the ribbon-connected space; sensory details like humming air and rumbling thunder integrate purposefully without overwhelming momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering collective grief tightens through the mentor's guidance and ribbon retracing, with a meaningful deepening in the poetry memory that reweights options, but escalation feels textural rather than narrowing with sharp costs, as the serene frenzy peaks without a foreclosed path's visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of grief as woven and shared emerges organically from ribbon, butterflies, and poetry rituals, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer where the final image reweights sorrow as migratory and collective without moralizing; subtext in spectral whispers and fluttering wings invites lingering ambiguity on loss's fluidity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with a distinct poetic texture in syntax and rhythm, like rippling forms and rumbling whispers, modulating with intensity; dialogue is subtextual and goal-driven in the mentor's urgings, but some perceptual signatures converge into elevated diction that feels less character-specific under revelation's stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and density in images like "wings a silent storm," but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "thundering calm" and "fiercely meditative") and mixed metaphors (e.g., "whirlwind of calm intensity") create minor artifacts that dull propulsion without obscuring closure; information advances atmosphere, though some sentences restate without added pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravestone carving, butterfly migration, and spectral poetry-trading offers a fresh angle on grief's shape, with risk in lyric accumulation heightening thematic stakes organically; the ribbon's evolving role feels inevitable, transforming familiar motifs without gimmickry.</comment>
