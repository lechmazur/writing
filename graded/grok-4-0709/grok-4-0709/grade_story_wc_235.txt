<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interior contradictions in jealousy toward past selves drive micro-choices like leaping to soar, earning the final renunciation of envy with visible emotional cost; embodied emotions shine in the dream confrontation, though some stock phrasing like "shattered something inside me" slightly dilutes specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, image patterns build density to a conceptual repricing at the grave, with undeniable emotional cost in transforming jealousy; orientation anchors early in the cabin, and one meaningful cadence shift suffices for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, POV-filtered details of the cabin's creaking walls and dream cliffside constrain solitude-driven choices and charge the final scroll-inscribing image, elevating atmosphere without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of distilling chaos tightens through dream jealousy, driven by agency in soaring and confronting the grave under the textural lens; emotional cost is unmistakable in the ebbing envy, though one deepening feels sufficient but not maximally intensified.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of taming feral chaos into narrative emerges organically from dream images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal repricing of death via the inscribed scroll without overt moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV delivers a distinct perceptual signature biased toward timeline confusion, with rhythmic prose modulating under emotional pressure; no dialogue, but purposeful compression in dream sequences pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dense prose with varied rhythm propels the narrative, but paraphrase loops on "jealousy" and "nostalgia" in the dream sequence create minor momentum drag without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lucid dreaming and self-jealousy after grave-sighting transforms familiar reflection tropes, with risk in the dream's nonlinear structure heightening stakes organically.</comment>
