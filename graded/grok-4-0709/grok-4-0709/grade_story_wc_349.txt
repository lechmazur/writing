<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find story origins is clear and intensifies through her actions, compelling her to release her vendor identity at the climax with felt cost. Interiority is concrete in scattered thoughts branching like glass limbs, revealing contradictory impulses in her quest versus her role. However, emotions lean abstract and metaphorical rather than deeply embodied, with some stock phrasing like "burned deeper" weakening specificity under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery of fragments integrating, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara steps into the origin, reweighting her existence with the cost of abandoning her slates. Causality holds via motivated ellipsis in her descent and incision, with one meaningful deepening in mapping absences. Orientation anchors early in the library setting, but some elisions in the core discovery feel slightly untaught, mildly diluting payoff legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The glass orchard library on swirling clouds is vivid and purposeful, with crystalline trees and glass fruits constraining Elara's inquiry and charging the final nexus image. Sensory details like shimmering moonlight and cloud eddies reflect POV bias and evolve with actions, mirroring internal fragmentation. A recurring object like the vial constrains her choices, elevating specificity without overbreadth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake in finding story origins escalates through textural density of absences quantified, tightening via the moonlight's dimming and shard confrontation, forcing her identity release as cost. One meaningful deepening narrows options at the core, with agency in renunciation. However, pressure feels somewhat abstract, lacking visceral layering in the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of fresh beginnings from measured voids emerges organically through images like clean slates and integrated fragments, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights narrative origins without moralizing. Subtext in glimmering parole implies release from chains, enriched by ambiguity in Elara's transformation. Emotional aftereffect lingers via her parole's cost, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable with perceptual signature in mindful scattering, and patterned elision in lyric mode is taught early via branching thoughts, paying off at integration. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic metaphors, but some register drift into abstract diction like "mosaic of inquiry" feels slightly unmotivated under stress. No dialogue present, so those bullets ignored.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose advances atmosphere through concise, multi-job sentences like the moonlight pooling "like mercury dreams," with varied rhythm and no major loops. However, some overwriting in stacked metaphors during incision obscures propulsion without payoff, and template cadence in thought fragments repeats stems mildly. Clarity holds at closure, but density dips in redundant absences tallying.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surreal elements like quantifying absence to map story genesis transforms trope of fresh starts, feeling inevitable via Elara's quest. Risk in integrated fragmentation heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on narrative origins, committed fully without retreat.</comment>
