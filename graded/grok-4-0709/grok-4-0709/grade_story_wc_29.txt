<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to outwit cosmic tricksters is clear and intensifies through her cautious hope, driving higher-stakes choices like flipping the switch; interiority is concrete with embodied emotions like trembling hands under pressure. Internal conflict shows in her wary optimism amid chaos, with actions revealing values via micro-choices, such as calibrating the emitter despite shouts outside. Flaws complicate her vigilance without hedging, but emotional progression leans tidy, avoiding deeper irrationality. The final renunciation of full healing earns stasis with visible community scars as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure links events tightly—signal discovery leads to interference, culminating in a Decisive Change where broadcasting disrupts tricksters, with resonant reconfiguration in the dispersing protests and Elara's vigilant smile. Orientation anchors early in the basement with Elara's desk, maintaining clarity without disorientation. Closure lands on-page with felt cost in deep community scars and ongoing threat, shaped by persistent constraints like subsonic frequencies. One meaningful tightening suffices, but ellipsis in reports feels slightly convenient without stronger causal ellipsis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The university radio station anchors vividly with gritty details like flickering bulbs, dusty records, and ozone scent, constraining choices by providing the transmitter as a tool that enables interference. Sensory specifics reflect Elara's urgency, narrowing to immediacies like rumbling floorboards during crisis. Environment evolves causally, with outside shouts pressuring her actions, and the antenna tower charges the final image of cosmic vigilance. Micro-setting of charts and emitter integrates into action, mirroring internal hope amid grit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of bridging community divide escalates causally through one meaningful tightening—aligning charts to counter tricksters—narrowing options and raising costs in potential violence. Agency drives the climax via Elara's interference, with visible price in lingering scars and her cautious smile, but coincidence in quick protest dispersal slightly undercuts earned resolution. Tension builds at multiple scales, with internal hope conflicting external chaos, though moral calculus feels implicit rather than sharpened. Under Causal lens, pressure coheres but lacks a secondary deepening for fuller intensification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of outwitting cosmic manipulations emerges organically from Elara's actions and star maps, resisting tidy morals by embracing ambiguity in ongoing threats and community scars. Subtext in ethereal grit implies human ingenuity against inscrutable forces, with the final image of her smile offering resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without stating a lesson. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars like recoiling signals, avoiding sentimentality. Insights feel earned, but thematic complexity could deepen with more counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable in close third-person, with perceptual signature biased toward astronomical details and cautious hope, modulating rhythm under stress like trembling hands. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic syntax blending scientific and ethereal diction, consistent without head-hopping. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; free indirect style is clean, but some filter verbs dull immediacy in peak moments, like "she imagined them." Purposeful compression in reflection anchors present without voice drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose advances with concision and varied rhythm, but paraphrase loops appear in adjacent sentences restating division and tricksters, dulling momentum in the middle third. Information density is high in action beats, with strong verbs and specific details like "graffiti-scarred walls," yet figurative muddle in "frayed threads in the void" slightly obscures clarity without payoff. No major artifacts touch closure, but template cadence in setup descriptions (e.g., repeated "she" openings) triggers minor deduction. Final line resolves effectively by recharging motifs with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Core premise of subsonic cosmic interference offers fresh synthesis of sci-fi and community discord, transforming tropes through Elara's radio station ingenuity and ethereal grit. Emotional specificity in cautious hope avoids generics, with the turn to broadcasting feeling inevitable from charts. Risk in bold cosmic tricksters heightens stakes organically, but proximity to familiar hoax-divide narratives lacks bolder subversion. Originality coheres as singular vision, with one fresh inflection in signal neutralization.</comment>
