<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Alex's claustrophobia is embodied through shallow breaths and surging tides in narrow spaces, creating contradictory impulses that drive micro-choices like pressing on despite fear, but interiority occasionally slips into stock phrasing like "phobia surging like a tide itself," diluting specificity; the final endurance earns a credible change with felt cost in conquering it momentarily, though relationships are absent as it's single-POV without secondary characters.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the plot chains motivated actions from entry to codex discovery to phase rituals, with clear orientation by the first paragraph anchoring Alex in the facility during tidal recess; closure delivers a Decisive Change as souls are freed via surging energy, with visible cost in the trembling facility and Alex's gasped retreat, though one ellipsis in the cryo-room activation feels slightly under-motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The forgotten facility's tidal constraints and crashing hush vividly anchor atmosphere, with sensory details like muffled waves and echoing drips filtered through Alex's phobia, constraining choices in flooded tunnels; the environment charges the final image as tides rise behind his emergence, evolving causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of freeing souls tightens causally through phase transitions, narrowing options with tidal pressure and phobia costs, culminating in a meaningful deepening at the cryo-room ritual where agency drives the surge; cost is legible in Alex's trembling hands and conquered fear, though coincidence in finding the codex slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of remembering the unremembered emerges organically from codex secrets and spectral pleas, with subtext in glowing tracks implying data ghosts' limbo; the final image offers resonant repricing as Alex finds himself, avoiding tidy morals, but some abstract assertions like "conduits for invisible things" border on direct statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual bias in phobia-tinged notices like narrowing corridors; prose texture distinct in rhythmic motifs like crashing hush, with purposeful compression in phase shifts; no dialogue, so policy skips those bullets, but voice modulates effectively under stress without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense with vivid metaphors like "flashlight beam slicing through dust motes," varying rhythm in action beats, but occasional overwriting in peak moments, such as stacked similes in visions ("danced like fireflies— the codex margin illuminant gold fleck, as if alive"), creates minor muddle without obscuring closure; no major loops, but some scaffold in repetitive hush echoes dulls propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spelunking, occult codex, and phase transitions via undersea cables transforms tropes into organic stakes, with ingenuity in tidal timeframe constraining rituals; the premise commits boldly without hedging, heightening risk in phobia confrontation, feeling inevitable at the dawn emergence.</comment>
