<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Amir's motivation from the drone strike trauma is clear and intensifies to compel his obsessive hunt, with embodied emotions like trembling fingers and pounding heart showing contradictory impulses in scene; interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing, and his flaws complicate choices leading to an earned stasis in vowing renewal with felt cost of loss. However, some emotional progression feels slightly tidy, lacking deeper irrationality under stress. The single-POV focus excels in revealing hierarchy of values through micro-choices like placing the geode.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure accumulates density through perturbations and data fractals, leading to a resonant reconfiguration at the end where Amir finds purpose with conceptual cost of his buried past; orientation anchors who, where, and when early in the floating observatory during cooldown. Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise, reweighting stakes with undeniable pressure, but lacks a stronger persistent constraint shaping tactics. Some causality feels elliptical without tighter linkage to narrow options more decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The floating observatory is vividly anchored with sensory details like humming capacitors and shimmering dome, filtered through Amir's POV bias; it constrains choices by providing the sensor arrays and isolation, charging the final image of the shuddering structure amid winds. Micro-setting of the geode integrates into action, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, and environmental details evolve with the hunt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of finding unused potential escalates through density increase in glowing nodes and memory flickers, with one meaningful deepening that reweights cost via the bride's face in data; agency in perturbations forecloses paths with felt sorrow, but pressure feels somewhat static without a sharper trade-off. Coincidence of winds complicates without resolving. The moral calculus between vengeance and renewal sharpens the peak, though stakes remain somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of untapped potential amid loss emerges organically from perturbations and the geode, with subtext in intangibly tangible wisps inviting reflection on unlived lives; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by repricing reality's layers without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through bleak exhilaration. However, some abstraction in "what could have been" borders on generic without sharper counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward scientific and traumatic filters, like whispering equations; prose texture in rhythmic syntax reflects Amir's mind under stress, with purposeful compression in data swirls. No dialogue present, so policy applies. Elision of full backstory is taught early and pays off at closure without confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and high density in images like "whisper made solid," advancing atmosphere, but occasional paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "perturbation" phrasing) and mixed metaphors (e.g., "slow fuse" to "adrenaline in a dying heart") dull momentum slightly without obscuring closure. Clarity is strong, with strong verbs, but some overwriting in peak beats like the final gasp adds minor scaffold. No major artifacts touch the ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes drone trauma with quantum hunting in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming sci-fi tropes through Amir's specific awakening and geode use; risk in bleak tone heightens stakes organically. However, echoes of post-trauma obsession feel somewhat familiar without bolder subversion. The final reconfiguration feels earned from particulars.</comment>
