<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to understand living houses is clear and rooted in his trait as a creeping normality noticer, intensifying through his ritual actions; however, interiority relies on abstract labels like "hushed blaze" without fully embodied contradictions under pressure, as seen in the ritual scene where emotions are summarized rather than shown in conflicting impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned observations and elisions toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where Elias realizes houses absorb lives' essences, with conceptual cost felt in the shared secret; orientation anchors early in the bay setting, but causality feels loose with the ritual's unmotivated words "reveal your breath" emerging without prior setup, slightly diluting the pattern's payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The quiet bay in spring is vividly rendered with sensory details like cherry blossoms and moss, filtered through Elias's perceptive bias, and it subtly guides his path to the cottage; a recurring object like the orris root shard charges the final image by embodying hush, constraining his ritual choice effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of unraveling the houses' mystery tightens once through the ritual's deepening insight, but pressure remains low-stakes and introspective without a clear reversal or visible cost beyond conceptual understanding; the ending realization reweights the stake, yet coincidence in finding the shard complicates without truly escalating options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of the unusual encroaching on the everyday emerges organically through Elias's notices and the houses' absorbed essences, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer at the realization without moralizing; subtext in displaced objects implies deeper meanings, but some overt statements like "a shard of hush" border on direct thematic echo, slightly reducing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature biased toward subtle anomalies like the gull's cry; voice has distinct lyrical texture in syntax and rhythm, teaching patterned elision early, but occasional register drift into elevated diction like "liminal hour" feels slightly unmotivated for Elias's mindset under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose features rhythmic variety and vivid images like "cherry blossoms drifting like pink snowflakes," with high density in descriptive beats, but paraphrase loops appear in repeated "creeping normality" phrasings and template cadence in sentences starting with "He," dulling momentum in the ritual scene without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise of noticing creeping normalities in living houses offers a fresh synthesis of mundane observation and mystical ritual, transformed through specific details like the orris root shard; risk in the accumulative structure heightens introspection, but the realization feels somewhat predictable, lacking a bolder non-obvious inflection.</comment>
