<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to rescue Mira's promise is clear and intensifies through analytical insights, with embodied emotions like volcanic tenderness shown in trembling fingers and sobs; interior conflict layers guilt with love effectively, though some diagnostic labels like "analytically intuitive" feel stock without deeper contradiction in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through a trail of discoveries leading to resonant reconfiguration in the final realization, with conceptual cost legible in Elias's weeping transformation; orientation anchors early in the archive, and causality holds via patterned elisions, though the ending's epiphany borders on summary without a sharper micro-turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive is vividly anchored with crumbling corridors and artifacts that constrain choices, like the concealed alcove guiding Elias; sensory details like worn chisel marks and faded colors reflect POV bias and pressure discovery, charging the final image of the sketched tapestry on the chamber floor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rescuing the promise tightens through deepening discoveries under the textural lens, with one meaningful cadence shift in the tapestry revelation forcing stance crystallization; cost is felt in emotional eruption, but pressure remains somewhat internal and abstract without a stronger external complication narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of preserving heritage amid destruction emerges organically from artifacts and Elias's arc, with subtext in vandalized eyes mirroring guilt; the final image offers resonant repricing of arson as guardianship without moralizing, though ambiguity feels slightly tidy in the "redeemed" archive line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable with perceptual signature in analytical observations, like sensing chisel marks; prose texture is distinct and rhythmic, but overwrought metaphors occasionally drift into elevated register clashing with stress, as in "volcanic tenderness" repeated without modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose has high density with purposeful metaphors like "heart stirred with volcanic tenderness," but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "promise" emphasis) and mixed similes (lava cooling into earth) dull momentum in discovery beats; clarity holds, yet template cadence in reflective blocks obscures propulsion without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes arsonist redemption with ancient archive trail freshly through artistic breadcrumbs and volcanic tone, transforming tropes via specific motifs like the gouged portrait; risk in lyric accumulation heightens emotional stakes, though ingenuity feels familiar in the deathbed vow setup.</comment>
