<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve wonder is clear and roots in Elowen's traits as a wise pruner, compelling her ritual action; however, interiority relies on abstract labels like "insatiably creative" without embodied contradictions under pressure, weakening emotional depth. The final planting choice feels earned but lacks visible cost in her internal state. Actions align with motives, revealing character through pruning and weaving, yet flaws like stock phrasing limit individuality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure follows because/therefore linkages from sensing the thinning weave to planting the seed, with orientation anchored early in the parapet setting; closure lands as a Decisive Change with the tree's growth restoring wonder, carrying conceptual cost of fading magic. One meaningful tightening occurs in the ritual step, sufficient for length, but some ellipsis in world-weaving feels unmotivated. Persistent inheritance constraint shapes tactics effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The verdant parapet beside the waterfall anchors vividly early, with mist and vines constraining Elowen's ritual through tactile serenity; sensory details like the "radiant hush" and "mossy stone" filter through her POV, mirroring internal hope, and the setting evolves causally with the planted seed charging the final image. Micro-setting of the locket and shears guides choices purposefully without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving wonder signals early and tightens once through the ritual capture, narrowing options under Causal lens, but escalation feels static with no on-page reversal or deepening cost beyond abstract waning; agency in planting forecloses nothing visibly, and resolution relies on off-stage wanderers without protagonist-driven price. Coincidence in realm access complicates minimally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of weaving worlds to preserve wonder emerges from events like the seed's absorption of essences, inviting reflection on lost magic without direct statements; subtext in the tree's shimmering leaves offers resonant ambiguity, reweighting the premise in the final image of eternal dawn. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality but lacks complexity in counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable with consistent free indirect style, but perceptual signature blurs into generic poetic diction like "mist-kissed vines" without character-specific bias; no dialogue present, so policy applies—voice texture is rhythmic but repetitive, with unmotivated elevated register in incantations. Elision in world transition is taught but not fully paid off under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense with figurative language like "colors sang" and "liquid light," but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "radiant hush" and "budding hope") and template cadence in descriptive runs dull momentum, especially in the ritual beat; information density is high yet overwrought, with mixed metaphors obscuring clarity at peak moments without pattern payoff. Final line resolves resonantly but artifacts touch closure image, triggering -0.8 deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise of a pruner weaving worlds via heirloom seed offers a fresh synthesis of fantasy and ecology, transforming trope of magical inheritance through specific ritual capture; however, emotional arc feels generic, with turns arising from convenience rather than bold risk. Authenticity coheres but lacks non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>
