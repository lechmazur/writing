<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elias's tranquil perception is concretely shown through his observations of ghosts and the box, rooting motivation in consistent traits that compel his vow to preserve unspoken words; however, internal conflict feels summarized rather than embodied in contradictory impulses during the ghost encounter, with emotions leaning toward therapy-speak in reflections like "regrets that haunted Elias more than any specter."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through patterned elisions of ghosts and memories to a Resonant Reconfiguration in Elias's vow and peace, with conceptual cost legible in the enduring covenant; orientation anchors early in the wasteland oasis; closure lands on-page with the box's placement charging the final image, though backstory blocks slightly exceed BRR allowance without fully tilting present stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The scorched wasteland and abandoned oasis vividly anchor atmosphere with sensory details like cracked earth and withered palms, constraining Elias's choices and charging the closure as bees guard the box; the setting evolves causally, mirroring internal regrets through decayed hives, fulfilling the 9+ test by pressuring the final vow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving unspoken words tightens through the box's discovery and ghost's appearance, deepening via contextual clues to a stance crystallization with emotional cost; under Accumulative lens, pattern breaks reweight the covenant, but pressure feels more atmospheric than agency-driven, with no strong reversal narrowing options mid-story.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of tangled covenants and unspoken words emerges organically from bees, flowers, and ghostly signs, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer as the box preserves their weight without moralizing; subtext operates in silences and implications, inviting reflection on loss, though some direct statements like "the essence of those unspoken words" border on assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with a distinct poetic texture in syntax and rhythm, reflecting Elias's perceptive bias in selective noticing of spectral colors; no dialogue, but perceptual signature is character-specific, modulating under emotional intensity without register drift, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid images like "translucent figures wandering the desolation," advancing atmosphere and character; however, paraphrase loops in descriptive stems (e.g., repeated "ghosts flickered" variations) and heavy figurative stacking in the box revelation dull momentum without payoff, triggering a -0.6 artifact penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes ghosts in a beekeeping wasteland with a tangled covenant freshly, transforming tropes through Elias's perception and the box's role in preserving words; risk-taking in mute eloquence heightens thematic stakes organically, feeling inevitable in the vow, though echoes of post-apocalyptic motifs lack bolder subversion.</comment>
