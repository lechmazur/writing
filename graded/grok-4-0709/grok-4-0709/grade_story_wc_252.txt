<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation for wild freedom is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like pressing the scrimshaw into Marek's hand, revealing contradictory impulses in her combative tenderness toward her old life. Interiority is embodied in her restlessness and sea-longing, with emotions layered contradictorily during the argument, avoiding stock phrasing. Marek's secondary pressure forces her stance crystallization, but some traits feel slightly archetypal, like his broad-shouldered tenderness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery of sea and scrimshaw, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in Elara's transformation and detachment, with felt cost in leaving Marek and her old life legible in the final glance back. Orientation anchors early in the sublittoral fringe with Elara's work. Causality holds via emotional accumulations, though the whale's call feels slightly coincidental without stronger setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe is vividly specific, with waves lapping at ankles constraining Elara's wandering and charging the final transformation image. Sensory details like the whale's resonant call are filtered through her POV bias, mirroring her internal storm. The setting evolves causally with the tides and mists, guiding her choice to wade deeper.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of embracing true nature tightens through the whale's call, deepening pressure via Marek's confrontation and forcing her detachment with visible cost in his heartbreak. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, cadence shifts reweight freedom's price. One meaningful intensification suffices, but coincidence of the island's appearance slightly undercuts agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of wild freedom amid enforced peace emerges through particulars like the scrimshaw unlocking hearts, with subtext in combative tenderness gestures. Final image of Elara's transformation offers resonant, non-literal repricing of true nature without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers in Marek's hope, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Elara's graceful, current-like movements and sea-biased noticing. Voice has distinct lyrical texture, modulating rhythm under emotional pressure like the argument's clashing words. Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot naturally, distinguishing characters through rough pleas versus soft retorts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high density, varying rhythm in wave-like sentences, but occasional overwriting in metaphors like "storm raging within her guarded heart" muddles clarity without payoff. No major loops or artifacts, though some figurative stacks in peak beats slow momentum slightly. Final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-violence peace with merfolk lineage and disappearing island transforms tropes through specific emotional costs and combative tenderness. Risk in fantastical shift heightens stakes organically. Core premise feels inevitable via ancestral scrimshaw.</comment>
