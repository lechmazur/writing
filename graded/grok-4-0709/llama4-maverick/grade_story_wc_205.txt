<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to reimagine a civilization through the shard drives her internal arc effectively, culminating in a credible self-reconfiguration with felt sorrow as cost, but interiority relies on summary labels like "burnished sorrow" rather than embodied contradictions in scene. Emotions are told more than shown under pressure, lacking simultaneous impulses that complicate choices. The poetically inclined trait reveals values through notebook verses, yet flaws feel abstracted without on-page mistakes compounding toward closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through reflective shards toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist rebirths as a chronicler, with conceptual cost in tempered sorrow legible in the final image. Orientation anchors early in the asteroid galleries, but causality is loose, with events like the rumble serving as textural breaks rather than narrowing options tightly. Closure lands on-page with a charged poise, yet lacks a persistent constraint shaping tactics beyond internal pondering.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting is vividly evoked with ornate carvings and luminescent atmosphere, selectively filtered through the protagonist's archaeological bias to mirror her sorrow and discovery. Sensory details like echoing footsteps and glinting facets integrate into action, subtly guiding her choices in the labyrinth. However, while it charges the final image of shadows and silence, it doesn't strongly constrain a pivotal decision, functioning more as atmospheric texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of reimagining a civilization deepens through the shard's discovery and reflective writing, with a cadence shift at the storm's subsidence reweighting personal purpose with sorrow's cost. Pressure builds internally via the archaeological dispute, but lacks a meaningful tightening that forces stance crystallization, remaining abstract without visceral trade-offs. The rumble complicates without resolving, yet overall escalation feels static, with no clear reversal narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of rediscovery amid loss emerges organically from the shard and asteroid relics, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights sorrow into hope without moralizing. Subtext in rituals like covering mirrors adds complexity, inviting reflection on uncertainty, but epiphanies feel somewhat asserted in lines like "it was not just the civilization that she reimagined, but herself." Emotional aftereffect lingers through particulars, avoiding sentimentality, yet ambiguity is tidy rather than lingering with counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual bias in the protagonist's poetic noticing of glints and rumbles, and rhythmic prose modulating with introspection. Voice texture is distinct in lyrical syntax, like "words flowing like a river of fire," teaching patterned elision effectively for accumulative buildup. No dialogue present, so those bullets are ignored; elision pays off at closure without confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose advances atmosphere through vivid images like "facets reflecting the faint luminescence," but repetitive loops such as "burnished sorrow" and "labyrinthine passages" create scaffold drag, especially in the final third, dulling momentum without payoff. Information density is moderate, with some sentences multitasking, yet paraphrase cycles like restating self-reimagination obscure propulsion at closure. Rhythm varies, but template cadence in reflective blocks, like sequential "as she" openers, triggers a -0.6 artifact penalty without harming clarity severely.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise of a revolutionary-turned-archaeologist on a time-visible asteroid offers fresh synthesis, transforming discovery tropes through poetic introspection and sorrowful tone. Risk in accumulative structure heightens internal stakes organically, feeling inevitable in the self-rebirth closure. However, emotional arc borders on generic renewal without bold, non-obvious inflections beyond the shard talisman.</comment>
