<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rachel's motivation to unravel the code is clear and rooted in her love for opera, intensifying through inspiration, but interiority relies on stock phrasing like "felt a surge" without deeply embodied contradictions; emotions are told rather than shown in contradictory impulses, though her final peace feels earned by the accumulative buildup; the single-POV focus shows micro-choices like tilting the program, revealing values with mild cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and revelations toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in Rachel's peaceful realization and changed state, with conceptual cost of eternal transformation legible in the final paragraphs; orientation anchors early in the flooded opera house; however, causality is loose with no strong tightening beyond the water manipulation, making the closure feel more atmospheric than propelled.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The flooded opera house with flickering lanterns is vividly specific, constraining Rachel's actions in the orchestra pit and charging the final image as she leaves; sensory details like lapping water and eerie shadows integrate into her perceptions, mirroring her liminal state; tone supports the haunting atmosphere without overt symbolism, though repetition of water and light slightly dulls freshness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling the code signals early but escalates texturally through image density rather than narrowing options or raising costs; one deepening occurs via water manipulation, but pressure remains low without opposition or trade-offs; agency is in her decision to disrupt, yet coincidence of water damage resolves without protagonist-driven cost, undercutting stakes under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of merging reality and performance emerges through images like ghostly figures and swirling music, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights her inspiration without moralizing; subtext in wordless conversation with the ghost adds ambiguity; however, explicit statements like "lost in the in between spaces" border on thematic echo, reducing organic complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Rachel's musical focus, but voice drifts into repetitive lyrical diction like "flickered, casting eerie shadows" without rhythmic variation under pressure; no dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision is minimal and legible, though psychic distance remains consistent without intentional shifts for beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic lulls from paraphrase loops like repeated "felt" and "as she" stems, dulling momentum in discovery beats; information density is moderate with multi-job sentences, but overwriting in water imagery creates muddle without payoff; clarity is maintained, yet template cadence in the ending ("As she...") triggers artifact penalty, obscuring the closure's propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The premise of a flooded opera house ghost code offers a fresh angle on artistic inspiration, with ingenuity in water damage as revelation method; however, it echoes familiar haunted-art tropes without bold transformation, feeling somewhat derivative; risk in textural buildup heightens atmosphere mildly, but lacks non-obvious synthesis at closure.</comment>
