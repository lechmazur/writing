<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The noticer's motivation for seeking tranquility and absolution feels consistent but lacks embodied contradictory impulses, with emotions summarized rather than shown in simultaneous conflict; the gardener's heuristically gentle trait is label-only without constraining choices. Interiority uses stock phrasing like "pang of recognition" without character-specific degradation under stress. The final gratitude feels earned through repetition but without a visible micro-choice hierarchy revealing values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through repeated visits and sensory patterns toward a resonant reconfiguration in the ending, with conceptual repricing of ordinary things offering renewal; orientation anchors early in the courtyard. However, causality is loose with minimal tightening, and the closure's cost feels oblique without a legible before/after change beyond summary assertion. The final smile and return promise provide charged poise but lack undeniable pressure from prior beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard and tea house are vividly described with sensory details like woven vines and blooming scents, integrated into action and reflecting the noticer's search for peace; the setting subtly mirrors internal renewal without overt symbolism. However, spatial choreography is vague during the gardener's emergence, and no element constrains a specific choice or charges the final image beyond atmospheric support.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of finding absolution escalates through pattern accumulation in repeated visits, with one deepening via the gardener's interaction; however, pressure remains static without a meaningful tightening that narrows options or forces trade-offs. The conceptual cost of past transgressions is declared but not viscerally felt on the page, and agency is passive endurance rather than active renunciation with price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of finding sacredness in ordinary renewal emerges implicitly through images like bread and gardening, avoiding direct statements, but resolves tidily without meaningful ambiguity or counter-readings. The final image offers a resonant non-literal answer by repricing the bread as a key to understanding, yet subtext in gestures and silences is underdeveloped. Emotional aftereffect feels honest but borders on sentimentality in the absolution motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Narrative voice maintains a consistent, reflective texture with purposeful compression in seasonal shifts, and perceptual bias filters details through the noticer's tranquility-seeking lens; no dialogue present, so those bullets are ignored. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract register like "tenuous absolution" without POV-specific idiom, and rhythmic control is even but lacks modulation under emotional peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose is clear and concise with varied rhythm, but paraphrase loops appear in repetitive descriptions of tea and bread savoring, dulling momentum without payoff; information density is moderate, with some sentences advancing atmosphere over propulsion. Figurative language like "creeping normality noticer" feels strained and muddled in the opening, though grammar and punctuation are clean overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The premise of a noticer finding absolution through guerrilla gardening in a secret tea house offers a fresh synthesis of urban renewal and personal forgiveness, transforming familiar tranquility tropes with specific details like the vanished bakery bread. However, the accumulative structure feels derivative of vignette-style reflections without bold risk-taking or non-obvious moral calculus to heighten stakes.</comment>
