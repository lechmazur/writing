<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The widow's motivation to process grief through carving is clear and intensifies via embodied actions like selecting wood and scraping, revealing contradictory impulses of pain and solace; interiority is concrete, avoiding stock labels, with emotions layered in tactile details. However, the internal conflict alternates summaries rather than simultaneous impulses in key moments, slightly weakening pressure at the carving's completion. The final endurance forecloses denial with felt cost in her sad smile, earning credibility under the textural lens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned details like rain, scraping, and boiling, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the completed carving and rust-hued peace, with conceptual cost of acknowledged impermanence legible in the empty kettle. Orientation anchors who (widow), where (loft), and when (afternoon post-loss) by the first paragraph, no penalty. Closure lands on-page with a cadence shift from simmering emotions to contained peace, though the pattern break feels subtle without a sharper intensification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft anchors atmosphere early with diffused light mirroring her rust-hued peace, evolving causally as rain persists to ground her meditation; sensory details like wood scent and tea aroma are selective, POV-biased, and constrain her ritual, charging the final serene image. Micro-setting of the table and stove integrates into action, subtly guiding her choices without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of processing grief tightens through the carving process, with a meaningful deepening as the form emerges, reweighting her emotions toward hope; internal pressure coheres, but escalation feels static without a stronger pattern break or visible trade-off beyond the sad smile. Cost is felt in the palpable grief, yet remains oblique without forcing a clearer stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence ("here and gone") emerges organically from the carving and boiling ritual, resonating in the final image of the completed piece without moralizing; subtext in wood grain and simmering builds emotional honesty, inviting reflection on loss. The ending offers a non-literal reconfiguration via rust-hued peace, though some direct statements like grappling with the concept border on assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in tactile wood details and grief-filtered senses; prose texture is distinct with rhythmic repetition of sounds like scraping and rain, modulating under emotional pressure. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; minor elision in time flow is taught through the ritual and pays off at closure without confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with vivid images like "rust-hued peace" and "rain-beaded skylight," varying rhythm in meditative sentences, but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "ash wood carving blank" and "sense of peace" variations) create minor scaffold in the middle, dulling momentum without obscuring closure. Information density is high in sensory integration, yet template cadence in carving descriptions triggers a -0.4 deduction; final line resolves cleanly by recharging the ritual.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise of a lion tamer's widow carving to contain grief offers a fresh synthesis of circus loss and woodcraft, with ingenuity in textural details like shifting grain transforming the familiar mourning trope; risk in quiet, accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry. However, the core angle echoes standard grief narratives without a bolder non-obvious inflection.</comment>
