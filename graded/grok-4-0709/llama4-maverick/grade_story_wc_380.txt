<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation to uncover deleted memories is clear and rooted in the lighter's traits, intensifying through the journey to the crystal, but interiority relies on stock phrasing like "overwhelming urge" without embodied contradiction. The leather-bound book with pressed wildflowers effectively reveals character under pressure, serving as a tangible connection that evolves meaningfully. However, emotions feel performed rather than layered with irrationality, limiting depth in pivotal moments like touching the crystal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure links events through because/therefore progression from the whale's beaching to the crystal's touch, with orientation anchored early in the dock-side setting. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with the flood of memories, carrying a felt cost of trepidation and reclaimed past, though the ending's wonder feels slightly unearned without sharper prior causality. One meaningful tightening occurs in the tunnels, narrowing options toward the chamber.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The harbor and subterranean chamber are vividly anchored with sensory details like salt scent and crystalline glow, filtered through the lighter's distracted gaze, subtly mirroring internal states. The salt crystal growing chamber constrains choices by providing the ritual space, charging the vision that drives the plot. However, some details like the beached whale remain static without evolving causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming memories is signaled early but escalates unevenly under the Causal lens, with one tightening in the coffee grounds ritual narrowing options, yet pressure from gravity pockets feels abstract without consistent cost. The crystal touch forces a stance crystallization with visible emotional cost, but coincidence like the whale's role complicates without deepening. Stakes remain somewhat declared rather than viscerally tested in the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of rediscovering forgotten memories emerges organically through images like pressed wildflowers and the crystal's pulse, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the lighter's wonder. Subtext in the book's connection and gravity's pull invites reflection on loss without confusion. However, the final image offers a resonant but somewhat literal answer, repricing the premise with conceptual cost yet bordering on sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable and close, with perceptual signature in the lighter's distracted gaze and gravity sensations, but voice texture feels uniform without rhythmic modulation under pressure. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; prose has purposeful compression in the journey, taught early via serene descriptions. Elision of deeper tunnel details pays off at the chamber, but minor register drift into abstract terms like "fabric of space-time" jars the focalizer's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose has decent clarity and rhythm, with sentences advancing atmosphere like the "gleaming silence," but paraphrase loops appear in repetitive descriptions of glow and gravity, dulling momentum in the tunnels. Information density is moderate, though overwriting in crystalline details creates muddle without payoff. No major artifacts touch closure, but template cadence in the ending's wonder sentences reduces propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes gravity anomalies and memory recovery with a fresh angle via coffee grounds and crystals, feeling organic rather than checklist-driven. However, tropes like hidden chambers and reclaimed past echo familiar fantasy without bold transformation, and the whale's role feels like ungrounded coincidence. Risk in blending mundane lantern lighting with mystical elements heightens stakes slightly but lacks inevitability in hindsight.</comment>
