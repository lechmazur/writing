<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eli's motivation as a "creeping normality noticer" is clear and drives her actions, rooted in a fascination with alive houses, but interiority relies on abstract pondering rather than embodied contradictions under pressure. Emotions are described more than shown through conflicting impulses, as in her ritual around the house where reverence feels stated rather than viscerally layered. The final realization humbles her with a felt cost of changed perception, earning some credit, yet flaws like stock self-awareness cap depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and realizations, with orientation anchored early in the bay setting, but causality feels loose with events like purchasing the shard lacking tight therefore linkage. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing in the deepened night, where Eli senses the house's energy with a humbling cost, yet the before/after shift is more told than dramatized. One meaningful deepening occurs via the ritual, sufficient for length, but redundant reflective blocks dilute momentum without strong micro-choices tilting stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The quiet bay in spring is vividly anchored with sensory details like blooming scents and lapping waves, filtered through Eli's perceptive bias, and evolves to sunset and streetlights, subtly mirroring her internal hush. Setting constrains choice in the house perimeter ritual, where the environment amplifies energy, charging the final image of vibrant walls. However, some details feel postcard-like without deeper tactical impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding alive houses signals early but escalates texturally through ritual rather than narrowing options, with one deepening in the vibrational shift, yet pressure remains low without a clear reversal or foreclosed path. Cost is obliquely felt in her changed state, but coincidence of the shard's presence resolves without agency-driven complication. Under Accumulative lens, cadence shift at sunset reweights subtly, but stakes stay abstract, lacking visceral test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of hushed profundity in ordinary spaces emerges through the shard and house ritual, with subtext in displaced objects implying reverence, inviting reflection on aliveness without tidy morals. The final image of pulsating energy offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of spaces, tied to Eli's arc. However, overt statements like "shard of hush" echo thesis directly, bordering on moralizing and reducing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with perceptual signature in Eli's subtle noticing, like the shard's creamy hue, and prose texture uses rhythmic, poetic syntax that modulates with serenity. Brief dialogue with the perfumer feels natural and advances knowledge via subtext on hush. However, some register drift into elevated diction, like "inadvertently profound presence," feels unmotivated for her voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety with vivid images like "hushed blaze of energy," advancing atmosphere, but paraphrase loops appear in reflective blocks, such as pondering houses' aliveness restated without new pressure. Information density is moderate, with some overwriting in peak moments like the ritual, muddling clarity without payoff. No major artifacts touch closure, but template cadence in sunset descriptions dulls propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise of sanctifying via a perfumer's shard offers a fresh synthesis of perfumery and spatial energy, transforming trope of mystical objects through Eli's ritual, with emotional specificity in her gratitude. Risk in quiet, introspective turns heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. However, core ideas echo familiar mystical discovery arcs without bold, non-obvious inflection.</comment>
