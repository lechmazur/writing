<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The herald's motivation to steer the dawn is clear and consistent, rooted in ancient traditions, but interiority relies on abstract summaries like "she felt herself becoming one with the shadows" without embodied contradictions or micro-choices under pressure. Emotions are performed rather than layered with irrationality, lacking visible costs in pivotal moments. The single-POV focus shows some perceptual specificity, but flaws feel label-only without complicating choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through repetitive ritual imagery toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the dawn's emergence, with conceptual cost in the herald's ongoing responsibility. Orientation anchors who, where, and when early via the lighthouse and starry sky, but causality is loose with unmotivated prophetic beliefs. Closure lands with a cadence shift, yet lacks a decisive tightening, relying on pattern without narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse under stars is vividly specific, constraining the ritual through its beam and stairs, with sensory details like eerie shadows mirroring the herald's elation. Atmosphere builds an otherworldly tone through selective light and shadow imagery, but some details repeat statically without evolving causally. The setting charges the final image of the lighthouse as sentinel, enhancing resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of shaping the dawn is signaled early but remains abstract, with one deepening via lantern adjustments under Accumulative lens, yet no meaningful reversal or visible cost forecloses options. Pressure accumulates texturally but feels static, with no agency-driven trade-offs; the resolution is a soft reconfiguration without dramatized consequence. Coherent but lacks intensification to force stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of preserving ancient rituals in a digital world emerges implicitly through the herald's actions and the post-newspaper timeframe, with subtext in light-shadow interplay inviting reflection on tradition's power. Resonance arises from the final image of the cycle continuing, reweighting the premise without moralizing. However, integration feels somewhat overt, with "Otherworldly routine" echoed repetitively without deepening complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with perceptual signature in light-focused observations like the beam "slicing through the darkness," and rhythmic prose modulates with ritual intensity. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; syntax varies purposefully in poetic mode. Elision of causal details is patterned and taught early, paying off in ethereal closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose has poetic rhythm with varying sentence lengths, but repetitive phrasing like "the emerald lighthouse" and synonym loops (e.g., "light... beam... shard of light") create scaffold drag, dulling momentum in ritual beats. Information density is moderate, with some lines advancing atmosphere via vivid images, but overwriting in figurative stacks like "dark and luminous" muddles clarity without payoff. No major artifacts touch closure, but template cadence in ascents reduces propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes lighthouse rituals with physics (total internal reflection) and post-print era in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming trope of guiding light through shadowed elation. Emotional specificity in the herald's joyful responsibility adds ingenuity, but turns feel patterned rather than boldly risky. Core elements cohere organically without close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
