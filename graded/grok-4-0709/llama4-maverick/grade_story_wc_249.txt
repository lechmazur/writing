<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Aria's motivation to nurture a shared dream while undergoing treatment is clear and intensifies through her drumming, revealing contradictory impulses in wanting to preserve fleeting connections; however, interiority relies on somewhat stock phrasing like "pang of auroral sorrow," which feels label-only rather than deeply embodied. The final sense of peace is earned via prior actions, with the sorrow providing a felt cost. Strengths lie in micro-choices like insistent drumming that show value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through rhythmic drumming and intensifying glow to a resonant reconfiguration of peace and connection, with conceptual cost in the fleeting sorrow; orientation anchors early in the sound wave garden. Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise, reweighting memories with undeniable pressure. Minor weakness in redundant sequencing of vibrations without sharper pattern breaks, but the deepening cadence shift suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vividly specific with resonating petals and vibrations that respond to drumming, integrating sensory details like pulsing lights to mirror Aria's internal harmony; the environment constrains her choices by enabling the connection and charges the final image with its whispering approval. Tone tensions the ethereal glow against sorrow effectively. No major flaws, though some details repeat statically without evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of nurturing the shared dream tightens through drumming's intensification, leading to a vision that deepens connection under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with auroral sorrow as a legible emotional cost; agency shows in her insistent actions narrowing options. One meaningful cadence shift suffices, but pressure feels somewhat abstract without a sharper trade-off. Coincidence in the lagoon's response complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of fragile, intertwined memories emerges organically from drumming and the lagoon's glow, culminating in a resonant final image of peace that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in vibrations and sorrow adds complexity. The vision offers a non-literal answer to connection's fleetingness. Strength in avoiding tidy morals, though some abstract statements like "collective unconscious" border on direct theme echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with a poetic, rhythmic voice that modulates with intensity, showing perceptual bias in Aria's fixation on the lagoon; no dialogue present. Patterned elision in memory swirls is taught early and pays off at the vision. Minor register drift into elevated diction like "auroral sorrow" feels slightly unmotivated for the focalizer under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic propulsion with varied syntax, but paraphrase loops in descriptions of glow and sorrow (e.g., "glow intensifying" repeated with variations) dull momentum in peak beats; information density is high in sensory integration, yet some synonym churn like "ethereal glow" and "otherworldly glow" creates minor artifacts. Final line recharges motifs effectively. No major clarity issues at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The sound wave garden and entangled memories offer a fresh sci-fi synthesis on connection, transformed through Aria's drumming and sorrow without stock tropes; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically. Emotional specificity in fleeting beauty feels inevitable. No close echoes of familiar scenes, though premise borders on abstract without bolder subversion.</comment>
