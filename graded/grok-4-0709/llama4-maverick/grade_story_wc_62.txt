<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The carver's motivation to understand collective grief is clear and intensifies toward her realization, but interiority relies on stock phrasing like "turmoil within" without deeply embodied contradictions; the spectral mentor feels underdeveloped as a secondary character, applying minimal pressure. Emotions are more performed than contradictory, though micro-choices like reciting the poem reveal values with some cost. Flaws complicate the resolution minimally, as the carver's meditative trait enables endurance but lacks visible trade-offs in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through patterned images of butterflies and ribbons to a Conceptual Repricing closure where grief is reweighted as beautiful yet terrible, with felt emotional cost in the final realization; orientation anchors early in the greenhouse at dusk. However, some causality feels loose, like the ghost's sudden materialization without stronger linkage to prior beats. The single meaningful deepening suffices for length, but lacks a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse at dusk is vividly anchored with sensory details like misty veil and blooming scents, filtered through the carver's meditative POV; it constrains choices by providing a serene space for reflection and charges the final image with butterflies clustering around headstones. Details evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism, and the environment affects the tone of thundering calm effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering collective grief's shape signals early and deepens through the poem recitation and butterfly arrival, narrowing emotional options with a felt cost of shifting grief; under Accumulative/Textural lens, cadence shifts reweight the stake adequately for length. However, pressure remains mostly internal and static, lacking a sharper tightening or trade-off that forces stance crystallization. Coincidence of the ghost and butterflies complicates but doesn't fully resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of collective grief as beautiful and persistent emerges organically from motifs like butterflies and poems, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights loss without moralizing; subtext in silence and implications adds complexity. However, insights feel somewhat unearned, bordering on platitudes like "loss was a part of life, but that it was not the only part." Emotional aftereffect is concrete but risks sentimentality in the peaceful resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward meditative observations like tracing butterfly paths; prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax that modulates with calm intensity. Some elision in ghost's presence is taught early and pays off at closure, but occasional register drift into elevated diction like "serene gloom" feels slightly unmotivated for the carver's voice. No dialogue present, so those bullets are ignored.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and some density, but paraphrase loops like repeated "peace settle over her" and synonym churn (e.g., "serene gloom," "thundering calm") dull momentum in peak beats; figurative language is dense without clear payoff, as in "weight of her grief begin to shift, like the turning of a great wheel." Clarity is maintained, but template cadence in reflective passages obscures propulsion at closure. Information advances atmosphere, yet redundancies like multiple fading light mentions trigger minor artifact penalties.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravestone carving, spectral mentorship, and butterfly migration in a greenhouse offers a non-obvious angle on grief, feeling organic through meditative voice; risk in quiet, accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes subtly. However, tropes like ghostly mentor and transformative realization echo familiar literary patterns without bold transformation. Freshness arises from specific details like the ribbon and poem tradition, but overall vision coheres more as thoughtful than singularly ingenious.</comment>
