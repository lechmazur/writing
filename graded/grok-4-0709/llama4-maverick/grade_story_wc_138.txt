<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in boredom leading to curiosity about the amulet, but interiority relies on stock phrasing like "heart, long thought to be still, stirred" without strong embodiment or contradictory impulses in scene. The final understanding feels earned through the duplicate encounter, yet lacks visible micro-choices under pressure to reveal value hierarchy. Relationships are minimally crucibled with the shadowy echo, applying secondary pressure but not altering status dynamics deeply.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through intensifying storm and energy patterns to a Conceptual Repricing closure where goodbye transforms into new beginning, with felt cost in trepidation and expanded awareness. Orientation anchors early in the escondite during the solar storm, avoiding penalties. One meaningful deepening via the duplicate's emergence reweights knowledge, sufficient for length, though causality feels more textural than tightly linked.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite is vividly detailed with swirling colors and otherworldly energy, selectively filtered through Kael's dimensional awareness to mirror internal intrigue. Sensory details evolve with the storm's intensification, constraining choices by amplifying magnetic fields. The setting charges the final image as a gateway to the infinite, with colors dancing in harmony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering "what happens after goodbye" signals early and deepens through storm zenith and energy surge, forcing stance crystallization under Situational pressure, but lacks a clear reversal narrowing options. Agency in weaving fields drives escalation texturally, with legible cost in trepidation, yet tension remains somewhat abstract without interwoven internal-external conflict. Coincidence of storm complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of goodbye as transformation emerges organically from the duplicate's line "I am what remains after goodbye" and Kael's realization, inviting reflection through ambiguity without confusion. Subtext in the symbolic hand gesture resonates, avoiding tidy morals, but epiphany feels slightly asserted rather than fully earned via struggle. Final image offers non-literal answer, reweighting premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual bias in dimensional awareness noticing multiple paths. Prose texture is poetic and rhythmic, modulating with tension, though brief dialogue like the duplicate's line carries subtext but lacks distinct idiom distinction. No head-hopping or unwarranted certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose advances atmosphere with vivid images like "swirling colors that danced across the walls," but features paraphrase loops, such as repeated "colors swirled" and "energy surged," dulling momentum without pattern payoff. Information density is moderate, with some overwriting in peak beats like the crescendo description. Rhythm varies, but template cadence in reflective blocks slows propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of immortality, spatial mutiny, and post-goodbye exploration feels fresh, transforming tropes through the duplicate echo and escondite gateway. Risk in conceptual reconfiguration heightens stakes organically, with emotional specificity avoiding generics. Core premise commits fully without retreat, though echoes familiar sci-fi immortality boredom.</comment>
