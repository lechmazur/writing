<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Aria's motivation to cultivate peace is clear and rooted in her pacifist traits, with interiority shown through embodied perceptions like tending roses, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in scene, reducing depth; the sword as a relic effectively reveals her renunciation with a felt cost of forgoing her father's path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when early in the glass-domed farm post-tower collapse, but structure is a single accumulative shard without meaningful tightening, leading to a resonant reconfiguration in the final stasis of tranquility; closure lands with conceptual cost via the "engraved quiet" stone, though lens ambiguity lingers until the end (−0.3 applied).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glass-domed desert rose farm vividly filters light and scents through Aria's POV, constraining her choices to nurturing over violence and charging the final image of serene belonging; sensory details like blooming flowers and rustling petals mirror her internal peace, though some repetition feels static.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of weaving continuity through chaos is signaled early but remains abstract without meaningful tightening or deepening under the accumulative lens; no on-page reversal or cost forces stance crystallization, leaving pressure static and resolution unearned by agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of peace amid chaos emerges organically from roses and the sheathed sword, with subtext in the "engraved quiet" stone offering resonant ambiguity; the final image reweights the premise non-literally, but explicit statements like "tranquil blaze" border on moralizing (−0.4 applied).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual bias toward serenity, and prose texture uses rhythmic repetition purposefully for lyric effect; however, syntactic monotony in descriptive loops dulls immediacy, and no dialogue appears to test distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Prose features paraphrase loops like repeated "tranquil" phrasing and synonym churn around peace, dulling momentum (−0.6 applied); information density is low with redundant descriptions, though rhythmic variation in paragraph lengths creates some visual flow; overwrought metaphors like "tranquil blaze" mix without payoff (−0.3 applied).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The premise of a pacifist in a post-apocalyptic rose farm offers a fresh angle on renewal, with ingenuity in repurposing airship scrap, but relies on familiar tropes of inherited violence without bold transformation; emotional specificity feels generic, lacking non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
