<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The navigator's motivation to navigate loss is clear and rooted in consistent traits like adaptability to moon phases, intensifying through her journey to compel the final acceptance; interiority is concrete with embodied grief, such as the "open wound" pain, but emotions sometimes lean toward summary rather than contradictory impulses in scene. The patina bronze censer foot reveals character under pressure as a relic of connection, yet internal conflict alternates summaries instead of simultaneous pulls. Flaws complicate choices, leading to earned stasis at the empty plain with felt cost of irrecoverable loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned reflections and cryptic calls, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration at dawn with conceptual cost of acceptance; orientation anchors early at the starlit signal station, avoiding penalties. Closure lands on-page as charged poise, reweighting grief into possibility, with the empty plain image making the emotional price undeniable. Minor redundancy in journey descriptions slightly dilutes linkage without breaking the accumulative cadence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The starlit signal station anchors atmosphere as a beacon in a shifting landscape, with sensory details like shadows and light filtered through the navigator's bias; moon phases subtly guide choices, constraining navigation and charging the full-moon surge. The patina bronze censer foot functions as micro-setting, its worn designs mirroring loss and constraining her reflective stance. Spatial coherence holds, but some descriptions repeat statically without evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming the past through reverse migration signals early, with one meaningful deepening via cryptic calls that narrow options toward acceptance; under Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates through patterns, forcing stance crystallization at the plain with felt cost of perpetual change. Coincidence in calls complicates without resolving, but stakes remain somewhat abstract, not always viscerally tested on-page. The final renunciation forecloses full restoration, yet lacks a sharper trade-off in the peak moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of resilience amid loss emerges organically from relics and migration, with the censer foot motif shifting meaning to charge solace without overt symbolism; subtext in moon fluctuations implies cyclical healing, inviting reflection on grief's topography. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of the past as foundation for the future, avoiding tidy morals. Minor thematic echo in "raw solace" phrasing slightly undercuts subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable, with perceptual signature biased toward luminous patterns and relics, modulating rhythm to heighten emotional intensity; prose texture is distinct in lyrical syntax, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets. Purposeful compression in journey summary pays off in the final image without withholding known facts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in reflective passages like the moon-waxing buildup, but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "build" phrasing in path and map) create minor scaffold in mid-story, deducting -0.4 without touching closure. Sentences propel through image and action, with strong verbs like "gazing" and "clutched" advancing atmosphere; final line recharges motifs effectively. No major artifacts obscure clarity, though some figurative language borders on muddle in the "topography of loss" repetition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise ingeniously synthesizes grief navigation with moon-fluctuating senses and cryptic calls, transforming trope of loss into a fresh reverse migration; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the plain's acceptance. Details like the patchwork existence feel particular and memorable, avoiding stock metaphors. Minor hedging in balanced solace slightly tempers boldness.</comment>
