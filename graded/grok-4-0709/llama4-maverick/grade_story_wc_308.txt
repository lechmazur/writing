<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The anthropomorphized stone skimmer lacks concrete interiority, embodied emotions, or contradictory impulses, with motivation to navigate without moving feeling abstract and uncompelled by pressure. No meaningful change or endurance emerges with felt cost, as the entity's stillness remains static without flaws complicating choices. The historically reverent trait is label-only, not constraining actions in a crucible of relationships or status dynamics, since no other characters appear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered descriptions but lacks a meaningful tightening or cadence shift, with closure as a vague Conceptual Repricing of stillness into movement without legible cost or reconfiguration. Orientation anchors the fantastical canyon early, but the timeless, non-causal progression feels outline-like without motivated ellipsis or pattern break paying off. No persistent constraint shapes the final image, and ambiguity in the lens persists at the end, triggering a -0.4 deduction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The canyon of endless echoes and towers of bone provide vivid, sensory atmosphere with purposeful details like dust accumulation mirroring time, but they rarely constrain choices or charge the final image, functioning more as static backdrop. Sensory selection reflects a contemplative tone, yet lacks evolution with events or integration into action, with no micro-setting like the arrowhead fully guiding perception under urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>No dominant stake is signaled early, with the vague goal of navigating without moving lacking coherent pressure or meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens, resulting in static contemplation without options narrowing or cost felt. Agency through observation feels passive, with no reversal, trade-off, or crystallization forcing stance, and coincidence in bird patterns resolves without complication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of harmony in stillness emerges implicitly from images like dust and echoes, offering resonant ambiguity without tidy morals, but relies on abstract assertions rather than concrete events or struggle. The final image provides a non-literal reconfiguration of movement, yet epiphanies feel unearned, with no subtext in gestures or irony deepening complexity. Recurring motifs like the pulse charge closure mildly but avoid symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person POV remains stable and apt for the lyric mode, with perceptual signature biased toward vibrational awareness and patterned elision taught early for legibility at closure. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, poetic diction, modulating with intensity, though no dialogue appears to test subtext or distinction. No head-hopping or unreliability issues, but some register drift into elevated abstraction feels unmotivated in peak contemplative beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Lyrical prose offers high density with vivid images, but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated dust accumulation and stillness motifs) and template cadence in sentence openings dull momentum, triggering a -0.6 deduction without payoff. Rhythm varies naturally, yet overwrought metaphors like "symphony of stone and shadow" mix inconsistently in peak beats, obscuring clarity. Information advances atmosphere, but redundancies like multiple pulse synchronizations create scaffold without propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The premise of a sentient stone learning through patterns offers a fresh angle on stillness and perception, synthesizing fantastical elements organically without trope reliance, though emotional truth remains abstract. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens thematic stakes subtly, but the core reconfiguration feels inevitable only in hindsight without bold transformation of familiar harmony motifs.</comment>
