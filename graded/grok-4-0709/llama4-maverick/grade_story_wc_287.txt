<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gardener's wistfully pragmatic motivation is clear and drives the pruning and reflection, but interiority relies on abstract labels like "sense of peace" rather than embodied contradictions; emotions feel performed without simultaneous impulses clashing in scene, as in the token handling of the lockmaster's tooth that reveals little under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and cadence shifts toward tranquility, with orientation anchored early in the harbor setting; closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing via the refreshed rosebush symbolizing resilience, but the cost feels oblique without a sharply felt before/after reconfiguration in the final smile.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The luminous harbor by moonlight is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory details like the oars' rhythm mirroring the gardener's work, subtly guiding choices and charging the final dawn image; however, spatial choreography remains somewhat abstract without tactile navigation constraining actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reflecting light into dark corners deepens through the pruning and token's glow, with one meaningful cadence shift toward purpose, but pressure stays low without a tightening that narrows options or forces a trade-off; the boat's rhythm complicates texture yet resolves nothing, leaving stakes abstract rather than viscerally tested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of nurturing hidden beauty emerges organically from the rosebush cycle and lockmaster motif, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the city's vulnerability without moralizing; subtext in the tooth's glow invites ambiguity, but epiphanies like "instilled a new sense of life" border on assertion over earned insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with a poetic perceptual signature biased toward luminous details, and rhythmic syntax modulates with emotional beats like the oars' soothing dip; no dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets, but minor register drift into elevated diction like "quivering hush" feels slightly unmotivated for the pragmatic focalizer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose features vivid, dense imagery with varying rhythm, but paraphrase loops like repeated "quivering hush" and "rhythm of oars" create redundancy without advancing pressure; overwriting in peak reflective beats, such as the extended token description, muddles propulsion without pattern payoff at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of urban gardening with lockmaster symbolism and harbor rhythm offers a fresh angle on renewal, feeling organic through the tooth's reprise; however, the premise echoes familiar poetic vignettes without bold risk-taking to heighten stakes beyond wistful acceptance.</comment>
