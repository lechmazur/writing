<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The librarian's motivation to preserve wonder is stated abstractly without intensifying through choices or pressure, lacking embodied emotions or contradictory impulses in scene. Interiority relies on stock phrasing like "harmonious blend" without character-specific degradation under stress. No micro-choices reveal values, and the character's fluidity feels label-only, as in the moon phases description that doesn't compel actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>No causal linkage or motivated turns exist; the narrative is a static meditation without beats advancing knowledge or options. Orientation anchors the tidal atrium early but deliberate disorientation with phrases like "after tomorrow disappears" doesn't pay off at closure, failing the test and applying -0.5. Closure lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with legible cost, as the ending image merely restates the premise without before/after or felt price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tidal atrium is vividly described with sensory details like saltwater scent and waves, integrated into the librarian's movements and reflecting internal states. However, details like the moon's influence feel generic and don't constrain choices or charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent but static, with no evolution affecting action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>1.7</grade><comment>No dominant stake is signaled, and there's no tightening, deepening, or pressure under the accumulative/textural lens; the narrative lacks any reversal or cost. Concepts like migrating identities remain abstract without narrowing options or forcing trade-offs. The ending offers no earned resolution or crystallized stance with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Theme of fluid identities and preserving wonder emerges through images but is stated directly in lines like "to preserve wonder in routine," bordering on moralizing without subtext or ambiguity. No earned insights from specifics; it invites reflection but resolves tidily without counter-readings. The final image restates the concept without resonant repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable with consistent perceptual bias toward poetic mystery, but voice drifts into abstract register mismatches like "migrating identities" without character-bound lexicon. Prose texture is rhythmic and purposeful in descriptions, yet lacks modulation under pressure since there's no stress. No dialogue present, so those bullets are ignored.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose has vivid rhythm and sensory density, as in "scent of saltwater and the soft lapping of waves," but includes paraphrase loops like repeated fluidity motifs without advancement, applying -0.6. Sentences vary syntax, but overwriting in peak descriptions muddles clarity without payoff. No major artifacts touch closure, but redundancy dulls momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Fantastical elements like titan-gear and tidal atrium offer a fresh synthesis of mechanical-organic themes, but feel like untransformed tropes without bold risks heightening stakes. The premise echoes familiar meditative sci-fi without non-obvious inflections or specificity grounding universals. The ending restates without ingenious reconfiguration.</comment>
