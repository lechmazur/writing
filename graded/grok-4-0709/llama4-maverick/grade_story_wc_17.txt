<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The cartographer's motivation to uncover secrets is clear and rooted in curiosity, intensifying through discoveries, but interiority relies on stock phrasing like "burning curiosity" without embodied contradictions or micro-choices under pressure. Emotions are somewhat embodied in shivers and racing minds, yet feel performed rather than contradictory, limiting depth. The meaningful endurance at closure forecloses isolation with a felt cost of entanglement, but flaws like unearned epiphanies prevent higher marks. No second character, so relationship dynamics are ignored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increasing through layered discoveries, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the cartographer becomes part of the legacy with conceptual cost legible in the final image of departure. Orientation anchors who (cartographer), where (ivy-veiled passage), and when (post-climate shifts) by ~50 words, waiving any penalty. Structure fits defaults with one continuous shard and meaningful deepening via diaries, but lacks persistent constraints shaping tactics, holding back excellence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage and estate are vividly anchored early with sensory details like shadows and echoes, evolving to mirror the cartographer's growing insight, though repetition of darkening imagery feels static. Atmosphere builds a tone of mystery and resonance, with environmental details integrated into action, such as finding the film strip in crumbling plaster. However, the setting subtly guides choices but does not strongly constrain them or charge the final image, as required for 9+ entry.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering the estate's legacy is signaled early but remains abstract, with one meaningful deepening through diary revelations that reweights personal connection, yet pressure feels static without narrowing options or visible costs under the Accumulative lens. Agency via endurance crystallizes stance at closure with conceptual cost, but coincidence of discoveries complicates without true complication. No antagonist or reversals needed, but lack of interweaving internal/external conflict keeps escalation functional rather than compelling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of legacy's enduring burden emerges organically from discoveries and climate-shift losses, resonating in the final image of the cartographer's entanglement without overt moralizing. Subtext in images like the film strip and diaries invites reflection on preservation amid change, with emotional honesty avoiding sentimentality. However, complexity is limited by tidy resolutions and stated insights, such as "the legacy's burden was not just a weight to be carried, but a story to be told," trending toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable with consistent distance, offering a distinct perceptual signature through sensitive observations like flickering mind's-eye scenes, and prose texture in rhythmic, flowing syntax suits the reflective mode. No dialogue present, so ignored; purposeful compression in accumulative discoveries is taught early and pays off at closure. Minor register drifts into elevated diction, like "labyrinthine corridors," feel slightly jarring for the cartographer's voice under low pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose features vivid imagery and varying rhythm, but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated emphasis on secrets, legacy, and dreams in adjacent sentences) and synonym churn (e.g., "uncover," "discover," "reveal") dull momentum without payoff, triggering -0.6 artifact penalty. Information density is moderate, with sentences advancing atmosphere, but overwriting in peak reflective beats, like stacked descriptions of shadows, obscures propulsion. No major grammar issues, but template cadence in long, clause-heavy sentences reduces clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise of a "corridor echo cartographer" seeking walls' dreams offers a fresh synthesis of exploration and legacy in a post-climate-shift world, transforming familiar estate-secrets tropes through specific elements like the film strip. Emotional complexity in loss and purpose feels authentic, with a non-obvious reconfiguration at closure. However, reliance on stock mystery archetypes without bold risk-taking limits ingenuity to strong but not exceptional.</comment>
