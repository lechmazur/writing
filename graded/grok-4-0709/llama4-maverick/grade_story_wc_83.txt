<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Amira's motivation to escape and seek answers is clear and rooted in trauma, but interiority relies on abstract summaries like "numbness that had shielded her" without embodied contradictions or micro-choices under pressure. Dr. Patel as a secondary character applies some pressure through collaboration, yet relationships lack crucible dynamics to force status shifts. The final endurance feels earned with visible emotional cost from the drone strike, but flaws like stock phrasing limit depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, the structure follows because/therefore linkages from the strike to the observatory discovery, with orientation anchored early in the wreckage. Transitions between shards (wedding to station) are legible, fitting Track B mosaic allowance with a coherent lens. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing via the realization of unused potential as a catalyst, with felt cost in Amira's scars, though the ending image feels somewhat declarative rather than charged.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The wreckage and floating observatory provide vivid sensory details like "scent of smoke and blood" and "gentle hum," filtered through Amira's urgency, but spatial choreography is vague during transitions. The geode crystal as a recurring object constrains choices by guiding focus, charging the final image. Atmosphere contrasts devastation with tranquility, supporting tone, yet details remain somewhat generic without deeper POV bias or environmental evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering unused potential signals early via the crystal's calm, with one meaningful deepening through data analysis that narrows options toward purpose. Pressure coheres causally, forcing stance crystallization in the revelation, but cost feels oblique beyond initial trauma without on-page trade-offs. Coincidence in finding the flyer complicates without resolving, yet escalation lacks visceral intensification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of awakening from trauma emerges through recurring images like the crystal's "intangibly tangible essence," reweighting the premise in the final Conceptual Repricing without overt moralizing. Subtext in the crystal's guidance invites reflection on unused potential, tied to Amira's arc, but integration feels somewhat imposed rather than organic. Emotional aftereffect is concrete via "bleak exhilaration," avoiding sentimentality, though ambiguity is limited.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable without head-hopping, with perceptual signature in Amira's trauma-filtered noticing, like the crystal's calm. Voice has poetic texture in phrases like "unfiltered awakening," but diction drifts into repetitive, abstract register mismatched to stress. Dialogue is minimal and functional, advancing plot via Dr. Patel's explanations, yet lacks subtext or distinct idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Prose suffers from paraphrase loops and synonym churn, like repeated "geode crystal clutched" and "intangibly tangible," dulling momentum without pattern payoff. Sentence rhythm varies somewhat, but template cadence in openings like "As she..." creates monotony, with low density in redundant descriptions. Figurative language muddles in peak beats, such as "bleak exhilaration" restated without propulsion, though grammar is clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes trauma survival with sci-fi perturbation theory for a fresh angle on awakening, transformed through Amira's specific choices like using the crystal as a talisman. However, elements feel stitched from prompts, with turns like the revelation arising from convenience rather than bold risk-taking. Originality in "unused potential" as catalyst heightens stakes modestly, but lacks non-obvious ingenuity.</comment>
