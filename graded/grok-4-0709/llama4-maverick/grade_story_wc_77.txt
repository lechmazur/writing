<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation through morbid curiosity and the whispering advisor's guidance is clear but relies on stock horror tropes without deep interior contradiction; emotions are embodied in shivers and dread but lack contradictory impulses in key moments like examining the clasp. The advisor feels like a device rather than a crucible for choices, and the final endurance forecloses no specific path with visible cost beyond vague change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through atmospheric beats toward a resonant reconfiguration in the blackout and awakening, with a felt cost of being forever marked; however, causality is loose with unmotivated whispers and a vague resuscitation reference, lacking a persistent constraint shaping tactics. Orientation anchors early in the funhouse but disorientation in the mirror confrontation doesn't fully pay off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The abandoned funhouse setting is vividly sensory with decay and glow, filtering through POV bias to mirror internal dread, and it constrains choices like venturing deeper; however, details like the poster and mirror evolve causally but don't fully charge the final image outside. Spatial choreography tracks coherently, but occupational depth is absent and unneeded.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, dread escalates through density of whispers and luminance, with one deepening at the mirror confrontation narrowing options; stakes of uncovering secrets feel abstract without a clear trade-off, and the resolution via blackout lacks protagonist agency, resolving coincidentally without visible cost. The dominant stake of confronting fear is signaled early but remains static without meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of seductive terror emerges implicitly through images like the cursed model and repulsive allure, inviting reflection on lingering trauma without tidy morals; however, subtext is thin in gestures, and the final image offers a resonant but literal haunting refrain rather than non-literal reconfiguration. Epiphanies feel unearned, asserted via the advisor's voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with perceptual bias in noticing glows and whispers, and prose texture builds dread through rhythmic repetition; however, the whispering advisor's dialogue converges with narrative voice, lacking distinction, and elision in the blackout feels untaught. No head-hopping, but psychic distance shifts unintentionally in reflective summaries.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety in creaking banners and musty darkness, but paraphrase loops like repeated "whispering advisor's voice" and synonym churn (e.g., "echoed," "whispered," "laughed") dull momentum, especially in the ending; information density is low with redundant dread assertions, and figurative language like "siren's call" is stock without payoff. Artifacts obscure the closure image without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The haunted funhouse premise echoes familiar horror tropes without fresh synthesis, relying on stock cursed images and whispering guides; while the repulsive allure tone offers a minor inflection, it feels ornamental, and the story hedges risks with vague revelations instead of bold specificity. No transformative angle on archetypes makes it swappable with generic ghost stories.</comment>
