<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The skeptic's motivation to understand homecoming is clear and rooted in rebellious traits, compelling the journey's choices, but internal conflict lacks embodied contradictory impulses in scene, as seen in the summarized pondering before convergence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images to a Conceptual Repricing in the final realization of self-discovery, with felt cost in transformative connection; orientation anchors early in the tower setting, though causality feels more atmospheric than chained.</comment>
