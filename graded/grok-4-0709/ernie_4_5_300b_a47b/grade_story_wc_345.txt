<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to orchestrate collective effort is clear and rooted in her altruistic traits, intensifying through her messages and leading to the settlers' united action at the climax. Interiority is concrete but limited to ethereal descriptions, with embodied emotions shown in her flickering form during observation. The settlers function as a collective rather than individuals, weakening relationship dynamics, though Elara's consistency builds trust effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the plot links Elara's messages to the settlers' mobilization and the arch's reinforcement, culminating in a Decisive Change where the arch holds with the nebula's flare signaling renewal. Orientation anchors early with Luminara's description, and causality holds without breaks, though the resolution feels slightly pat with collective will mending cracks. Closure lands on-page with felt cost in Elara's fading, foreclosing her active role.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating rock arches is vividly specific, constraining choices as the crumbling arches drive the conflict and pressure the gathering beneath the largest one. Sensory details like pearl-fruited trees and twilight nebula integrate into action, mirroring Elara's ethereal presence. The setting evolves causally, with the arches' fade affecting the nebula, charging the final golden bath image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of saving the arches from crumbling is signaled early, tightening through messages that shift doubt to determination, narrowing options to collective action under Causal escalation. One meaningful deepening occurs at the gathering, with tools and chants forcing unity, though cost feels more conceptual than visceral in the effort. Coincidence is absent, but resolution relies on incantations without sharp trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of collective hope amid decay emerges organically from Elara's messages and the nebula as a promise, resonating in the final image of the chiming bell without stated morals. Subtext in cryptic chalked phrases invites reflection on trust and renewal, enriched by ambiguity in Elara's fading. The ending offers a non-literal answer to isolation versus unity, reweighting prior hardships.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable, with perceptual signature in ethereal whispers and shimmers biased toward hope, modulating rhythm in flowing, poetic syntax that suits the tone. Dialogue is minimal but natural, like Elara's resonant hum advancing the gathering. No head-hopping, though some elision in her materializing feels patterned and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in descriptive openings and propulsive action at the gathering, avoiding loops except minor synonym churn in message repetitions. Figurative language like "flickering like a candle flame" enhances without muddle, and clarity holds in peak beats. Final line recharges the bell motif effectively, with clean mechanics throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise of an altruistic ghost using chalked messages on an orchard planet synthesizes sci-fi and spectral elements freshly, transforming unity tropes through the nebula's sanctuary role. Risk in cryptic communication heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the collective chant. No close echoes of famous scenes, with authenticity in the brambled hope tone.</comment>
