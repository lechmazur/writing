<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in dual allegiance, driving her to reorganize graffiti into a resistance map, with embodied emotion in handling the stone chip; however, interiority occasionally slips into stock phrasing like "her intuition hummed," diluting specificity under pressure. Jax as secondary character applies relevant pressure but lacks depth in status dynamics. The final endurance of her role shows credible renunciation with felt cost in ongoing struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure features motivated linkages from graffiti decoding to plan implementation and Council confrontation, with orientation anchored early in the raft city's edge; closure is a Charged Poise as the barge retreats, reconfiguring options with felt cost in "the fight wasn’t over," though the resolution feels slightly soft without a sharper decisive change. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The raft city setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "fried dough and diesel" filtered through Lira's POV, constraining choices in the Alley of Whispers where the mural drives action; the foundation stone chip as recurring object charges the final image by slipping back into her pocket, symbolizing hope amid grit. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, evolving with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving the carnival's soul escalates causally through graffiti reorganization, tightening via the spiral-square symbol and Council arrival, forcing stance crystallization with visible cost in ongoing fight; however, the reversal at climax relies somewhat on group solidarity rather than Lira's sole agency, softening pressure. One deepening shift is sufficient, but coincidence of vendor murmurs complicates without fully resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of balancing chaos and order emerges organically from graffiti symbols and the stone chip, culminating in a resonant final image of "chaos tempered by purpose" without moralizing; subtext in the drowning clown mural invites reflection on gentrification's cost. Emotional aftereffect is concrete but borders on sentimentality in the "flicker of hope."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature in Lira's orderly intuition shaping notices like tracing the mural; dialogue is natural and subtextual, as in Jax's "You’re a madwoman" pursuing alliance. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic descriptions, with no head-hopping; brief elision in plan explanation is taught and paid off at confrontation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing through vivid images like "eyes replaced by dollar signs," but occasional paraphrase loops, such as repeating "order" concepts in adjacent sentences, dull momentum slightly; rhythm varies naturally, and final line recharges the stone chip motif effectively. No major artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise of graffiti as resistance map offers a fresh angle on gentrification, transforming trope of cultural preservation through specific symbols like spiral-square; however, the hopeful standoff echoes familiar underdog narratives without bold risk-taking. Emotional specificity in dual allegiance heightens stakes organically.</comment>
