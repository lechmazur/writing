<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation as a reckless idealist is clear and intensifies through her regret over the drowned boy, compelling her to barter with the Fool card; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like trembling hands during the sewing, revealing contradictory impulses of certainty and doubt. The keeper applies secondary pressure effectively, forcing her to confront flaws without stock phrasing. However, emotional progression leans toward tidy resolution in the vision, slightly hedging moral ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Hybrid (Causal dominant at closure), with because/therefore linkages from bartering the card to sewing and eating the fruit leading to decisive change in her soul's patching; orientation anchors who (Lirael), where (catacomb orchard), and when (timeless half-light) by ~50 words. Closure is a valid Decisive Change with felt cost in reweighted regrets, visible in the vision of the boy as a lesson. Minor ellipsis in the transition to the clearing feels motivated but could tighten for stricter causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly specific with snaking roots through bones and bioluminescent fungi, constraining choices like Lirael kneeling in soft earth and charging the final image of emerging into sunset; sensory details are purposeful, balancing visual glow with tactile cold stone and vibrations. Atmosphere supports the dusky resolve tone through half-light mirroring her internal patching. Micro-setting of the tree and skeleton directly enables the sewing ritual, evolving causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of patching soul holes escalates under Hybrid lens through tightening pressure in the sewing and fruit-eating, narrowing options with the keeper's guidance and culminating in a deepening vision that reweights her recklessness; one meaningful tightening suffices, with visible cost in trading certainty for doubt. Agency drives the climax via her decision to sew and eat, foreclosing past certainty. Coincidence of the fruit falling complicates but does not resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of transforming regret into gentle wisdom emerges organically from particulars like sewing the skeleton and eating the pulsing fruit, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final image of patchwork soul holding firm without stated moral. Subtext in gestures like pressing the card and biting the fruit invites reflection on recklessness as fiercely gentle. Emotional aftereffect is concrete, avoiding sentimentality through bitter-sweet juice and flawed whole tapestry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Lirael's biased noticing of pulsing fruit and humming skeleton; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, image-rich prose modulating with intensity, like shortening sentences during sewing. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances plot, with keeper's rustling voice contrasting Lirael's steady tremor; no head-hopping or register mismatch. Purposeful compression in the vision pays off at closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere in lines like "roots snaked through the bones" without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the sewing beat with short, precise stitches. Figurative language is controlled, like "teeth like broken shards," without muddle or register drift. Minor synonym churn in regret descriptions ("regret turned into resolve") dulls slightly but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing bartered destinies with catacomb orchard imagery, transforming mystic trope through specific sewing ritual and fruit's heartbeat, feeling inevitable in hindsight; risk in lyric vision heightens stakes without gimmickry. However, premise echoes familiar redemption arcs, with the keeper as stock guide, lacking bolder subversion.</comment>
