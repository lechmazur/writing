<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clara's face blindness and methodical nature drive her empathetic approach, shown through embodied actions like tracing the ribbon and sketching, creating contradictory impulses in her reliance on texture over visuals; however, Voss feels somewhat one-note as a weary detective, with status dynamics underexplored despite their partnership. The motivation to awaken empathy intensifies credibly, culminating in the locket discovery that forecloses numbness with emotional cost. Interiority avoids stock phrasing but occasionally veers into abstract labels like "dormant ache."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with causal dominance holds, as ribbon investigation leads to sketching, handprint, and locket discovery in a continuous quarry scene; orientation anchors early with mist and easel. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration via the locket and mist lifting, repricing the case's numbness with felt emotional cost in Clara's tightened throat. One meaningful tightening suffices, but ellipsis in evidence history feels slightly unmotivated without stronger causal tie to the pit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The misty quarry's damp stone and jagged pit constrain choices, like examining indentations, and charge the final image of sharpening edges mirroring revived empathy. Sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, with mist blurring edges to reflect Clara's face blindness. Atmosphere builds tension purposefully, evolving causally as mist lifts at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of solving the cold case via empathy tightens once through sketching the handprint, narrowing options and revealing the locket with visible emotional cost in Clara's reaction. Pressure coheres under hybrid lens, but coincidence of lantern glint feels convenient, complicating without fully resolving. Agency in Clara's intuition drives the turn, though stakes remain somewhat abstract until the locket.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of unifying opposites to awaken empathy emerges organically from Clara's art merging hard stone with soft ribbon, culminating in the non-literal final image of the portrait as a reminder of buried truths. Subtext in gestures like handing the charcoal stick invites reflection on connection. Avoids moralizing, embracing complexity in desperation's marks.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close to Clara maintains stable distance, with perceptual signature in texture-focused noticing like light pooling in hollows. Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot, distinguishing voices—Voss's weary rasp versus Clara's soft corrections. Prose texture is distinct, with rhythmic control in mist descriptions heightening pressure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, like "mist clung like a second skin" advancing atmosphere and character, but occasional paraphrase loops, such as repeating ribbon's significance, dull momentum slightly. Rhythm varies naturally, and metaphors are coherent, though some figurative language in the sketching beat borders on overwriting without muddle. Clarity holds at closure, with strong verbs propelling the discovery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Face-blind artist's empathetic sketching to solve cold cases offers fresh synthesis, transforming mystery tropes through texture-based clues like the handprint. Risk in unifying art and logic heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the locket reveal. Avoids stock echoes, committing to premise without hedging.</comment>
