<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to repair the drone is clear and rooted in her artisan traits, intensifying through tactile "seeing" that compels her choices under pressure. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like tracing warmth, avoiding stock phrasing. The relationship with Marlow acts as a crucible, forcing recalibration with subtextual guidance. However, internal conflict lacks strong contradictory impulses in scene, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through sensory patterns like mist and light refraction, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final image where ongoing work reweights purpose with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors early in the depot setting. Causality holds in repair beats without breaks. Closure lands on-page with felt calm amid endless tasks, though cost could be more visceral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mist-coated depot anchors vividly, with sensory details like clattering chains and water basin integrated into action, reflecting Lira's priorities. Environment constrains choices, as the basin's light reveals truths pivotal to repair. Micro-setting of the workbench and basin charges the final image. Tone supports theme through softening mist harmonizing with her hum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of ensuring drone functionality tightens through the servo misalignment deepening pressure, narrowing options under Accumulative/Textural lens. One meaningful intensification via water refraction forces recalibration with visible cost in overcorrection analogy. Agency in patching and submerging earns resolution. However, stakes remain somewhat abstract without sharper ethical calculus or interwoven internal conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of seeing through listening emerges organically from repair particulars, culminating in non-literal resonant answer via water's light turning chaos to clarity. Subtext in Marlow's guidance and lullaby invites reflection on invisible mending without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete humility. Final image reweights premise with ambiguity, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stays stable, with perceptual signature in tactile bias like brushing surfaces, modulating distance intentionally. Voice texture distinct in rhythmic prose echoing clatters and hums. Dialogue natural, subtextual, advancing plot via Marlow's rumble on servo issues. No head-hopping or elision issues; diction fits Lira's world.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere like mist clinging "like a second skin." Rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops, though occasional figurative stack in basin scene borders overwriting without muddle. Clarity strong, with strong verbs and specific nouns propelling momentum. Final line resolves by recharging light motif effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blind artisan using water refraction transforms trope of disability into ingenuity, feeling inevitable through tactile details. Premise offers non-obvious angle on guidance via drones and light. Risk in lyric calm heightens stakes organically. However, core repair arc echoes familiar mentor-apprentice dynamics without bold subversion.</comment>
