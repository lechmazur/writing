<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as a truth excavator is clear and intensifies compellingly, driving her from investigation to sacrificial choice; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like breath fogging and intuition prickling, revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. The final renunciation of the diamond earns its cost through prior causality, foreclosing catastrophe with visible relief in the orchard's relaxation. Strengths shine in micro-choices, like pocketing the letters, that hierarchy values with felt stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages from journal discovery to letter reassembly to fissure opening, culminating in a decisive change at the pedestal with legible cost of sealing the stillpoint. Orientation anchors early in the orchard scene, avoiding penalties. Closure is on-page with resonant reconfiguration, as the wasteland's hope emerges post-sacrifice, though minor ellipsis in Crane's fate slightly softens hindsight inevitability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard is vividly specific, with glowing apples and radioactive grit constraining Mara's actions, like brushing aside dust to inspect roots; atmosphere builds tension through humming air and frozen dust, charging the final image of relaxed trees and cleaner air. Sensory details are purposeful, filtered through Mara's observant bias, and the setting evolves causally with the fissure's shudder.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preventing boundary collapse escalates causally through reassembly and clearing entry, tightening to a meaningful deepening at the pedestal where agency in placing the diamond forecloses catastrophe with felt cost in the chamber's tremble. Pressure coheres under causal lens, narrowing options from investigation to sacrifice, though coincidence in symbol alignment slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of excavating truth from dangerous secrets emerges organically through Mara's arc and the stillpoint's reconfiguration, with subtext in the diamond's consequence-not-curse resonating without moralizing; the final image of walking away with hope offers a non-literal answer reweighting the premise. Emotional aftereffect lingers in survival's complexity, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Mara's sharp observations like trees arching like fingers; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, purposeful prose modulating with intensity, as in the humming air's charge. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; elision in transitions is minimal and legible under causal lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere in lines like apples glowing amid dust storms; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops, though minor figurative muddle in "branches unfurling like sighs" at closure slightly dulls propulsion. No significant artifacts or redundancies obscure clarity, and strong verbs propel beats effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cursed diamond and dimensional stillpoint feels fresh, transforming tropes through Mara's debunker lens and wasteland specificity; risk in conceptual repricing at the pedestal heightens stakes organically. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on truth's consequences, cohering as singular vision without hedging.</comment>
