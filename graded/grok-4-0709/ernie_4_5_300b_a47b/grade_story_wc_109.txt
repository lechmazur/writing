<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to map the endless night is clear and intensifies through her persistent sketching despite physical aches and environmental distractions, with embodied emotions like trembling lips revealing internal contradictions under pressure. The obsession with hushes is shown through concrete actions, such as tracing mortar cracks, rather than mere labels, earning the final renunciation of fear with a felt cost in her isolation. No second character limits relationship dynamics, but single-POV interiority is character-specific and avoids stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through layered silences and imagery, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the glowing map reweights absence as presence with conceptual cost in shedding gold flakes and infinite patience implied. Orientation anchors early in the fort's cliffside setting post-storm, with no disorientation debt. Closure lands on-page with the map's pulse syncing to her breath, holding the lens without contradiction, though a more visible persistent constraint could elevate further.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The storm-tossed ridge fort is vividly specific, with sensory details like groaning walls and skittering pebbles mirroring Mara's internal hush, constraining her choices by providing shelter yet interrupting with gusts. The setting evolves causally, charging the final image as the map's glow illuminates cracks and ghosts, fulfilling the 9+ test by directly shaping the closure. POV filters details through her oracle bias, avoiding generic clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of drawing the map tightens through deepening hushes and nested silences, with one meaningful cadence shift as lines pulse with her breath, reweighting the stake under the Accumulative lens. Agency drives escalation via her quill strokes despite aches, making cost legible in physical strain and void-dancing risk. Coincidence like the gust complicates without resolving, though stakes remain somewhat abstract until the final glow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as layered presence emerges organically from sketching pauses and echoes, culminating in a resonant final image where the map glows by capturing absence, offering a non-literal answer that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in gold flakes shedding like snow adds complexity, inviting reflection on voids without confusion. Emotional aftereffect lingers through her trembling smile, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with Mara's perceptual signature evident in hush-obsessed noticing, like symbols dissolving when stared at. Prose texture is distinct and rhythmic, with patterned elision in shifting symbols taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue, but voice modulates with pressure, fulfilling the 9+ test without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and rhythm accelerating through sketching beats, free of loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle—e.g., "ambered hush" pulses vividly without contradiction. Information density is high, each line advancing atmosphere and character, as in the quill's hesitant lines. Zero artifacts in peak moments like the final flourish secure the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of oracle lore with silence-mapping transforms tropes through specific details like seashell ink and shedding gold, feeling inevitable as the map glows from layered hushes. Risk in lyric abstraction heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, though familiarity in storm-fort isolation slightly tempers freshness. Core premise offers a non-obvious angle on absence as presence.</comment>
