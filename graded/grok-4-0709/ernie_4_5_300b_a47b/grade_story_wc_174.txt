<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation for ethical storytelling is rooted in his past eulogy compromise, intensifying through concrete micro-choices like manipulating the story stick during the show; interiority is embodied and contradictory, showing serenity amid tension, though Mara's role feels slightly underdeveloped as secondary pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through reflective buildup and the puppet show, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where Elias reweights his storytelling method with conceptual cost in accepting half-truths; orientation anchors early in the dome, but the argument's hush is more atmospheric than causally tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome's skeletal ribs and curved walls constrain choices by providing a unique canvas for projections, charging the final image as Elias gestures to its fracturing light; sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, evolving with the lantern's flicker to mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of exploring ethical storytelling tightens through the puppet show's reversal under Accumulative lens, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in Elias's raw vulnerability post-argument; one meaningful deepening suffices, though coincidence of audience arrival slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of ethical storytelling as half-truths emerges organically from the puppet roles and campfire metaphor, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final image without moralizing; subtext in dialogues like the drifter's scoff invites ambiguity, reweighting prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Consistent third-person close POV with distinct perceptual signature in Elias's ink-stained fingers and serene voice; dialogue carries subtext and advances theme naturally, as in Mara's grandfather anecdote, with rhythmic control heightening the show's pressure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with purposeful metaphors like "rusted crown" and varying rhythm that propels the performance beat; minor scaffold in repetitive glow descriptions, but no loops obscure closure, and information advances atmosphere effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of calligrapher's redemption via subversive puppetry in a radar dome transforms storytelling tropes with specific details like rune-carved stick; risk in half-lit epiphanies heightens thematic stakes, feeling inevitable at the ending campfire invitation.</comment>
