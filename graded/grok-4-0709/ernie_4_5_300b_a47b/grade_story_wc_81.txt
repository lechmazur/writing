<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to trace honest origins is clear and intensifies through her methodical actions, culminating in the journal's discovery that earns her purpose with a felt conceptual cost. Interiority is concrete and embodied, showing contradictory impulses like clutching the stamp for order amid chaos. The single-POV focus excels in revealing flaws through micro-choices, such as sketching the door grooves, without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned discoveries to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Lira reweights the city's history with undeniable truth, carrying a felt cost in her heavy realization at the desk. Orientation anchors early in the blackout and library, serving the moody buildup without disorientation. One meaningful deepening occurs at the door's opening, sufficient for length, though the groan's source feels slightly under-motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sunken library's vivid, purposeful details—like moonlight through cracked skylights and algae-slick stairs—constrain Lira's choices and charge the final image of swimming home, functioning as micro-setting that mirrors her resolve. Sensory hierarchy reflects her perceptive bias, with tactile vibrations and stale air integrated into action. Environment evolves causally, heightening atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering the city's truth tightens through the door's puzzle, deepening knowledge with the journal's revelation under the Accumulative lens, forcing a stance crystallization with conceptual cost. Agency shines in Lira's readjustment via sketching and stamping, narrowing options authentically. One meaningful intensification suffices, though stakes remain somewhat abstract until the confession of failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of confronting buried truths emerges organically from Lira's discoveries, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the journal's confession, reweighting denial as self-sabotage without moralizing. Subtext in images like the owl stamp symbolizes vigilance, inviting reflection on honesty. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through quiet complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature biased toward logical indexing, as in noting book titles methodically. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, textured syntax that modulates with gloom, teaching patterned elision early for legibility. No dialogue, so policy skips; elision pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose advances with high density and varied rhythm, as in the opening's creeping blackout metaphor, though occasional figurative stacking like "dappled resolve" borders on muddle without harming clarity. No loops or scaffolds obscure cause; sentences propel via strong verbs and concise images. Final line recharges motifs effectively, with clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of a sunken library vault revealing self-inflicted decline offers a fresh angle on denial, transformed through Lira's perceptive lens and the stamp's evolving role. Risk in textural buildup heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the journal's quiet confession. Avoids tropes via specific details like bioluminescent algae.</comment>
