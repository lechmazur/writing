<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation as a beautician mortician is clear and intensifies through her precise, artistic channeling of magic, compelling high-stakes choices like embellishing the emerald to stabilize it. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in her trembling fingers and synchronized breath during the infusion, revealing values under pressure. The final endurance forecloses oblivion with felt cost in exhaustion, earned by prior micro-choices. Strength in her flawed competence, balanced with genuine struggle, avoiding stereotypes through specific worldview.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through density of patterns and cadence shifts, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the emerald's transformation and pool's sealing, with visible cost in cracks and exhaustion. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first paragraph, serving the single-scene scope without debt. Closure lands on-page with conceptual repricing of stillness as a canvas, reweighting the premise. Minor slip in ellipsis of post-infusion recovery, but it doesn't obscure causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the skyborne grotto's crystalline walls, bioluminescent moss, and aurora constraining choices, such as the pool's fissures leaking starlight that heighten stakes. Sensory details are selective, filtered through Lirael's professional bias, mirroring her internal hush and amplifying atmosphere. The environment evolves causally, with cracks sealing to charge the final image. Recurring pool as micro-setting directly shapes the closure, meeting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving Elion's echo signals early and deepens through one meaningful tightening when the pool cracks, forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative/Textural lens. Pressure coheres via coherent magical risks, with agency in Lirael's unconventional embellishment foreclosing collapse at felt cost of exhaustion. Moral calculus sharpens in balancing preservation against grotto integrity. Strength in legible cost at climax, but lacks a secondary accent for higher escalation depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of enduring beauty against oblivion emerges organically from Lirael's actions and the emerald's transformation, with subtext in patterns and echoes inviting reflection on preservation's complexity. Final image offers resonant, non-literal repricing of stillness without moralizing, reweighting prior material. Emotional aftereffect is concrete through her triumphant slump and aurora's kiss. Avoids sentimentality, embracing ambiguity in "if only for a little while."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Lirael's watchful noticing of pulses and patterns, modulating rhythm under pressure without head-hopping. Prose texture is distinct, with purposeful compression in lyric descriptions taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; free indirect style is clean, shifting distance intentionally for emotional beats. Meets 9+ test with rhythmic control heightening infusion scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "liquid starlight" without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the cracking pool beat. Figurative language is controlled, avoiding muddle in peaks, though some elevated diction borders on overwrite without harming clarity. Information propels forward, with strong verbs and specific nouns; no artifacts touch closure. Minor synonym churn in early descriptions, but overall propulsion supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing celestial mortuary with beautician artistry, transforming tropes of preservation through specific magical lattice and pattern-finding, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Fresh angle on oblivion via echoes and comet shards, with bold risk in lyric hush heightening stakes without gimmickry. Core premise commits fully, avoiding derivatives; the unconventional embellishment inflects the closure uniquely. Meets 9+ test with non-obvious synthesis and risk elevating coherence.</comment>
