<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through layered memories and humming, leading to resonant reconfiguration where night frays and realm pulses with undeniable conceptual cost of Lira's ongoing loneliness.

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rekindling the realm tightens through humming's intensification, deepening via melody absorption that reweights hope with Lira's exhaustion cost under textural lens. One meaningful cadence shift narrows options, forcing endurance with visible price in her hoarse voice. Agency in humming drives agency, though coincidence of glimpsed child complicates without resolving. Cost unmistakable in final peaceful fatigue, but lacks sharper ethical calculus.</comment>
