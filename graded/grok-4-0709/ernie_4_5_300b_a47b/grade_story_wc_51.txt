<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to collect burdens is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like adjusting the flame on the resistant obsidian, revealing embodied contradictions in his trembling hands and sweat; the final renunciation of his mother's locket feels earned by prior reflections, foreclosing resolution with emotional cost. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, though some reflections border on summary without tilting present stance more sharply.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered tasks and deepening atmosphere, with orientation anchored early in the bronze grotto; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis, where Kael leaves the locket untouched with felt emotional cost, reweighting burdens' weights. One meaningful deepening occurs with the obsidian crack, shifting cadence, though the draft's arrival feels like minor coincidence complicating without resolving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bronze grotto is vividly sensory with wet metal air and calcified walls, constraining choices like orienting by starlight and charging the final lighter ambiance; details evolve causally as hush thins, mirroring Kael's internal relief. Micro-setting of niches and pool integrates into action, heightening specificity without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of collecting burdens without shattering them tightens under textural lens through density increase with the obsidian resistance, forcing a stance crystallization and conceptual cost in the heart-breaking crack; agency via renunciation at the mother's niche forecloses a path with visible emotional price, though stakes remain somewhat abstract until that peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of transforming untended burdens emerges organically from weaving fractals and the grotto's sigh, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the untouched locket, repricing endurance with ambiguity; subtext in smoke and dust images invites reflection without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through the dream's lullaby, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in metallic tastes and fractal patterns, modulating rhythm under pressure like the trembling adjustment; prose texture is purposeful and lyric, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation there.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like the crack "like a heart breaking," advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold; information density high, with lines multitasking via embodied images, and no artifacts muddle peak beats or closure. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, enhancing momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fractal weaving and calcified burdens feels inevitable, transforming trope of inherited trauma through specific grotto mechanics and the locket's renunciation; risk in lyric density heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, offering fresh emotional truth in the whalebone reverie tone.</comment>
