<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in her father's legacy, intensifying through embodied emotions like shaking hands and resolve under pressure, culminating in the earned choice to smash the device despite the cost of hearing his plea. Interior conflict shows contradictory impulses, such as hesitation before placing the fob on the scale, revealing values with visible trade-offs. The trait of being "curiously steadfast" is shown through actions like persisting after false starts, avoiding label-only use. Minor slip in secondary characters feeling somewhat stock, but it doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the causal lens, the plot advances through because/therefore linkages, from eavesdropping leading to the stall to the confrontation and decisive smash, with orientation anchored in the first sentence via who (Lira), where (Saltspire Pier), and when (night). Closure is a decisive change with resonant reconfiguration, as smashing the device forecloses the buyer's plan and reweights Lira's legacy with the cracked fob, carrying felt cost in the "comforting unease." One meaningful tightening suffices, with the recording reveal narrowing options. No orientation debt, but minor redundancy in missteps doesn't harm causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The pirate market beneath the pier is vividly specific with sensory details like brine and opium stench, constraining choices such as hiding behind beams and navigating crates, and it charges the final image as the market dissolves into the tide. Details filter through Lira's POV, with the clock tower's frozen hands mirroring stalled trust. Environment evolves causally, from humming stalls to erupting chaos post-smash. Recurring watch fob as micro-setting constrains the climax by serving as the smashing tool.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the causal lens, the dominant stake of thwarting the device sale escalates through one meaningful tightening—the recording reveal forcing Lira's smash—narrowing options with the cost of destroying her heirloom and hearing her father's betrayal. Pressure coheres, with false starts building to the confrontation, and agency drives the resolution via her decisive act. Stakes feel visceral, not abstract, with moral calculus in choosing silence over exposure. Coincidence in timing complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of trust and silence emerges organically from events like the device's function and father's "hush" mantra, culminating in a resonant final image of the cracked fob reweighting legacy without stated moral. Subtext operates in implications, such as the buyer's laugh and Lira's smile amid unease. Avoids tidy morals, embracing complexity in her father's flaws. Minor drift in overt "trust breaks so beautifully" line, but it doesn't undermine resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Lira's biased noticing of lantern flickers and fob's cold anchor, modulating rhythm under stress like sprinting breaths. Dialogue is natural, subtext-laden, and goal-driven, distinguishing voices like the lisp-man's hiss versus buyer's shattered glass. No head-hopping or unwarranted certainty; elision in father's recording pays off at climax. Distinct texture in syntax, with purposeful compression in action beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing through vivid images like "tide gnawed at barnacled pilings" without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the tower sprint. Figurative language is controlled, purposeful, and coherent, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the smash. Strong verbs and specific nouns propel momentum; final line recharges the fob motif effectively. Minor synonym churn in early descriptions, but it doesn't touch closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise of a device capturing trust breaking in a pirate market offers fresh synthesis, transformed through Lira's steadfast choices and the fob's evolving role, feeling inevitable in the smash. Risk-taking in blending noir with fantastical elements heightens stakes without gimmickry. Avoids stock tropes by grounding in emotional complexity of legacy. Minor echo of adventure archetypes, but specificity in "comforting unease" elevates originality.</comment>
