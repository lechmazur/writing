<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cedar's motivation to rebuild from molting personalities is clear and intensifies through concrete interiority, with embodied contradictions like trembling hands and shifting eyes revealing flaws under pressure. The relationship with Marla acts as a crucible, forcing a stance on acceptance with visible cost in his ongoing fragmentation. However, some emotional summaries lean toward label-speak, such as "mind fracturing," slightly diluting specificity at the molt moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through patterned motifs like the tin and poems, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Cedar accepts his chaos via the new poem, with felt cost in his dulled eye and reformed mind. Orientation anchors early in the library at moonrise, serving the nocturnal atmosphere without disorientation. One meaningful cadence shift at the molt deepens knowledge, though the ellipsis in personality change feels mildly under-dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars is vividly specific, with flickering bulbs and corrugated metal constraining choices like hiding the tin, and it charges the final blooming image with atmospheric resonance. Sensory details filter through Cedar's bias, evolving causally as lights flicker out to mirror his shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of self-rebuilding amid molting tightens through accumulative pressure, with the molt forcing a deepening that reweights options toward growth, carrying felt cost in his earthquake-like shift. Agency via endurance forecloses panic, though coincidence in finding the new poem slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of forging beauty from anarchy emerges organically through recurring images like the tin and poems, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in Marla's silence and Cedar's quill-dipping invites ambiguity on resistance's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual signature in Cedar's biased noticing of worn books and stars, and rhythmic prose modulates poetically under stress. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and distinct, like Marla's gruff softening, advancing their bond without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid metaphors like "flapped like a moth’s wings," but occasional overwriting in similes creates minor muddle in peak beats, such as the mantra echo. No major loops or artifacts obscure closure, and rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of molting personalities and a talismanic tin transforms vagrant poet tropes into a fresh angle on identity, with the final poem's map feeling inevitable and risk-taking in open acceptance heightening stakes.</comment>
