<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lila's motivation rooted in grief is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like unclasping the pendant, revealing contradictory impulses of fear and hope that earn the final vulnerability with felt cost. Elias applies secondary pressure effectively as a crucible, forcing her to graft meaning onto wounds. Interiority is concrete and embodied, avoiding stock phrasing, though Elias feels slightly one-note in his supportive role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images like drips and moss, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in planting the sapling with legible conceptual cost of expanding her brother's story. Orientation anchors early in the data center garden. Closure lands on-page with charged poise, though the final snow line feels slightly tacked-on without deepening the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned data center turned moss garden constrains choices and charges the final image, with server racks as anchors mirroring Lila's grief; sensory details like honeyed hush and glowing moss are selective, POV-filtered, and evolve causally. Recurring drip pattern integrates into action, reflecting internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grafting meaning onto grief tightens through the pendant modification, narrowing options with felt vulnerability cost under textural lens; one meaningful deepening via Elias's moss addition forces stance crystallization. Pressure coheres but lacks a sharper reversal, with coincidence of his arrival complicating without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of healing as expansion emerges organically from images like the grafted pendant, offering a resonant non-literal answer to old wounds without moralizing; subtext in silences and gestures invites reflection on vulnerability. Final image reweights the premise with complexity, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Lila's biased noticing of patterns and glows; dialogue carries subtext and advances goals naturally, distinguishing voices through Elias's low hum. Prose texture is purposeful, with rhythmic control under pressure, no head-hopping or unwarranted elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel beats; metaphors like "honeyed hush" are coherent without muddle. Minor scaffold in repetitive "graft" phrasing slightly dulls momentum, but no loops touch closure; final line resolves by recharging motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tech ruins as grief garden transforms tropes through specific details like bioluminescent moss and drip patterns, feeling inevitable with risk in quiet vulnerability that heightens stakes. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on healing without gimmickry.</comment>
