<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation as a myth buster chasing an unde bunkable legend is clear and intensifies through her actions, with contradictory impulses between logic and wonder embodied in her playing the cello despite doubt. The final renunciation of pure logic carries a felt cost in the "ache in her chest," earning the change via prior buildup. Interiority is concrete but occasionally slips into stock phrasing, like "gloomy cheerfulness," which feels coined for effect rather than organic. Quick test met with visible cost in the closure realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through descriptive layers and pattern breaks like the merging hums, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the riddle is repriced as felt harmony with conceptual cost in Lira's worldview shift. Orientation anchors early in the observatory setting. Closure lands on-page with the glowing note and her humming, reweighting prior elements. Minor ellipsis in the astronomer's vanishing feels motivated but doesn't fully tighten causality at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned observatory is vividly specific with dust motes, rusted telescopes, and buzzing panel, constraining choices like positioning the shell on the cello. Sensory details are purposeful, reflecting Lira's urgency, and the dome creaking open charges the final star-filled image. Micro-setting of the cello and shell functions as environment that alters tactics. Quick test met as setting directly shapes the closure reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding the riddle tightens through the deepening hum and spinning dials, reweighting options under Accumulative/Textural lens with a cadence shift forcing stance crystallization. Agency drives the playing despite risk, with unmistakable cost in her emotional ache and foreclosed logical path. One meaningful deepening suffices, but coincidence in the glowing note slightly complicates without fully resolving. Quick test met via protagonist-driven escalation and legible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of harmony bridging logic and wonder emerges organically from the shell's hum syncing with the cello, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer that the riddle is to be felt. Subtext in vibrations and shadows invites reflection on empathy over equations without confusion. Final image of humming into the wind reweights the premise with ambiguity. Quick test met, though epiphany borders on stated in the last line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Lira's biased noticing of cosmic maps and hums, modulating rhythm under pressure like the keening sound. Her muttered dialogue carries subtext and advances the investigation naturally. Prose texture is purposeful with poetic compression, teaching patterns early. Quick test met with no elision issues or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid metaphors like "fossilized question" advancing atmosphere, varying rhythm naturally without loops. Information density is high, with lines multitasking in peak beats like the vibrating shell. Minor overwriting in stacked figuratives during the hum, but no clarity loss at closure. Quick test met with zero artifacts touching the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of myth-busting with musical-cosmic riddle feels inevitable through specific details like the half-finished cello and ephemeral compass, transforming tropes with emotional complexity. Risk in the textural buildup heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on logic versus wonder. Quick test met, though familiarity in ghost-chasing edges on stock without bolder subversion.</comment>
