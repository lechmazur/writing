<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly from the shard's pull to his final renunciation, with embodied emotions like the throbbing heartbeat showing contradictory impulses in scene; the change feels earned by prior causality with the felt cost of lost pursuit visible in his trembling hands and hollow ache.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure holds with because/therefore linkages from the shard's compulsion to the portal jump and decisive shard-hurling closure, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis with legible emotional cost in the final awakening; orientation anchors early in the bay, and one meaningful tightening suffices at this length, though the parallel-world reveal borders on convenient without deeper setup friction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay is vividly anchored with sensory details like rusting gantries and dust motes, evolving causally to the gleaming parallel version that constrains Kael's confrontation and charges the closure by contrasting worlds; the micro-setting of the platform and visor integrates into action, guiding choices without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, the dominant stake of uncovering the withheld truth tightens meaningfully through the portal entry, narrowing options and forcing the renunciation with unmistakable on-page cost in the hollow ache and trembling; agency drives escalation via Kael's whispered "Show me" and shard toss, though the woman's exposition slightly softens pressure at the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of truths as burdensome choices emerges organically from the shard's pull and mother's warning, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the final image of removed visor and fading dreams, reweighting prior pursuit without moralizing; subtext in the woman's smile and silent nod invites lingering ambiguity on parallel losses.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Kael's visor-filtered hues and biased noticing of the shard's symbols; prose texture distinct through rhythmic syntax like "He fell. Gravity reversed," modulating with pressure, and brief dialogue carries subtext in the woman's "You're late" without voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in short punches during the vortex and longer breaths at closure, free of loops or scaffold; metaphors like "time bled sideways" are controlled and purposeful, though minor register drift in "cyclically spontaneous" feels slightly academic for Kael's stress-degraded perception in the peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes parallel universes with personal loss in a non-obvious way, transforming the missing-mother trope through the shard's evolving compulsion and bold risk in the open-ended peace, feeling inevitable via the hologram echo; however, the guild insignia and portal mechanics echo familiar sci-fi without bolder subversion.</comment>
