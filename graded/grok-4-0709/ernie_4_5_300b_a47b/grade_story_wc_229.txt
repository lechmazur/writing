<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in family grief, intensifying through her hummed intent and leading to an earned endurance with emotional cost in the tears; interiority is concrete, embodied in her trembling hand and swallowed words, showing contradictory impulses like fear and love acting simultaneously. Thalos provides secondary pressure that alters her stance without overshadowing her arc. The single-POV focus excels in micro-choices, such as exhaling into the vial, revealing her value hierarchy with visible vulnerability. However, the quick resolution of her blind spot via Thalos feels slightly unmotivated, though it doesn't derail closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through sensory patterns and cadence shifts, culminating in a valid Conceptual Repricing where whispers prove effective with conceptual cost in silent proof and emotional release; orientation anchors early with the lighthouse at dawn. The single continuous scene flows with motivated ellipsis, like the climb upstairs, advancing knowledge via the vial's glow. Persistent constraint of the cork shapes the final image, enhancing closure legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse at dawn is vividly anchored with salt-streaked tower and gold-bleeding sky, constraining choices like placing the cork on the windowsill for dawn rays; sensory details are selective, POV-biased toward scents and vibrations, mirroring Elara's intent. The micro-setting of the lantern room and garden pots charges the final image with rain patter and glowing cork. Weather affects the mood, evolving causally with the storm's ghost to rain, supporting theme without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving whispers travel farther escalates via accumulative density of hum, scent, and vial glow, deepening to force stance crystallization with felt cost in tears and village warmth; one meaningful cadence shift at Thalos's revelation narrows options, reweighting intent as current not wave. Agency in Elara's exhale and hum drives the intensification under the lens. Coincidence of Thalos's appearance complicates but doesn't resolve, maintaining coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of whispers outlasting shouts emerges organically from Elara's family grief and vial ritual, resonating through images like the glowing cork and village warmth without direct statements; subtext in silences and scents invites reflection on unspoken emotions. The final image offers a non-literal answer, reweighting the premise with ambiguity in silent proof. Emotional aftereffect is concrete, avoiding sentimentality via her tears mixing with rain.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward scents and vibrations, like the garden perfume; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, sensory prose modulating with intensity, such as the low hum. Dialogue is natural, subtext-laden, advancing plot via Thalos's grin and lesson without exposition. No head-hopping or unwarranted certainty; elision in the ending village shift is patterned and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and character via vivid images like "dawn bled gold into the bruised sky"; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops, though minor synonym churn in scent descriptions slightly dulls one beat. No artifacts obscure closure, with strong verbs and specific details propelling to the resonant end. Figurative language is controlled, enhancing without muddle in peak moments like the exhale.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes mystical intent with lighthouse isolation in a fresh way, transforming trope of whispers vs shouts through specific vibrations and scents; risk in quiet, accumulative build heightens stakes organically. Emotional specificity in swallowed words feels inevitable, avoiding generics. No close echoes of famous scenes, with ingenuity in the vial's role charging closure.</comment>
