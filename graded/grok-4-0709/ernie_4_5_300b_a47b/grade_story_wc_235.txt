<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied contradictions, like the "feral nostalgia that clawed at my ribs" driving micro-choices; final clarity earns a resonant renunciation with felt emotional cost, though some diagnostic labels like "chronologically confused" feel stock without deeper embodiment in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, orientation anchors early with the grave and cabin; structure builds through reflective shards to a Conceptual Repricing closure where nostalgia becomes a compass, with legible conceptual cost in the emotional reconfiguration at the ledge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful details like the "weathered logs groaning" and slick ice crevice constrain the climb and charge the final pedestal image; sensory hierarchy reflects POV bias, evolving causally to mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconciling past selves tightens through the arduous climb, forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative/Textural lens; one meaningful deepening at the blank scroll narrows options with felt physical and emotional cost, though stakes occasionally feel abstract before the ledge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of embracing fragmented identity emerges organically from grave and scrolls, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer at the ending clarity; subtext in images like soaring as smoke avoids platitudes, inviting reflection through ambiguity without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Consistent first-person POV with distinct perceptual signature in jaded, reflective texture; syntax modulates rhythm under pressure, like ragged breaths during the climb, with purposeful compression teaching patterns that pay off at closure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in lines like "I’d never felt so alive and so dead at the same time," with varied rhythm; minor scaffold in repetitive metaphor stems (e.g., jealousy as monster) slightly dulls peak beats, but no loops obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of self-grave and ritual scrolls transforms introspection tropes through specific chronology confusion; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the reconfiguration without gimmickry.</comment>
