<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong interiority rooted in Lira's loss of smell, with embodied emotions and micro-choices like tracing the screw revealing contradictory impulses between her fractured perception and interpretive drive; motivation intensifies credibly to the note-writing, earning the final renunciation of silence with felt cost in her own unresolved grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned insights and motifs like fog and gears to a resonant Conceptual Repricing in the note and final smile, with legible cost in Lira's mirrored loss; orientation anchors early in the shop and fog, though the revelation's ellipsis slightly softens causal traceability at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory details in the shop and fog mirror Lira's occluded perception, with the environment constraining her interpretive choices and charging the final image as the fog lifts, reflecting regained clarity; micro-setting of objects like the screw integrates seamlessly into action without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unveiling emotional miracles tightens through textural density of discoveries, culminating in agency-driven note-writing that reweights options with felt cost in Lira's loss; one meaningful deepening via the engraving suffices, though pressure remains more internal than viscerally escalating.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of resilience through occluded reading emerges organically from images like the screw and fog, offering resonant ambiguity in the final tapestry metaphor without moralizing; subtext in silences and relics deepens complexity, though the ending's explicit "ordinary miracle" phrasing edges toward statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature biased toward tactile and visual cues, reflecting Lira's loss; prose texture in rhythmic, lyric syntax heightens emotional beats without elision or head-hopping, teaching patterns early for legibility at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in concise, multi-job sentences, with varied rhythm and no loops or artifacts; metaphors like "phantom scent" and fog diffusion are controlled and purpose-driven, accelerating momentum to the polished screw's glow without overwriting in peak insights.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of aromatherapist's loss with water clock metaphors transforms familiar loss tropes into a non-obvious emotional mapping premise; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the tapestry weave without gimmickry.</comment>
