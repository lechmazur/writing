<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lila's motivation to collect silences is clear and intensifies through her anticipation and the doll's loss, compelling her final renunciation with felt cost; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like tasting rust and fear, but some stock phrasing (e.g., "claustrophobia dissolved") edges toward therapy-speak, slightly undercutting contradiction in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through sensory layers of silence, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing with the sprout's emergence reweighting loss into hope with conceptual cost; orientation anchors early in the bunker, and one meaningful cadence shift at the doll's loss tightens pressure effectively, though the inversion's mechanics feel slightly elliptical without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bunker and xenial trellis are vividly sensory, with details like cool metal and honey-tasting silence filtered through Lila's bias; the trellis constrains her clinging choice and charges the final sprout image in the bunker crack, mirroring internal growth, though some atmospheric repetition (e.g., silence flavors) borders on checklist without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of seeking edible silences tightens through the inversion's time limit and doll's loss, forcing renunciation with visible cost under Accumulative lens; one deepening cadence shift reweights options from fear to hope, but stakes occasionally feel abstract until the sprout's conceptual payoff, limiting visceral escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of loss seeding growth emerges organically from the doll's sacrifice and sprout's promise, with subtext in silences as intangibly tangible; the final image offers resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing, though some direct statements (e.g., "stretching contracted fears") verge on thematic echo, slightly diluting ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual signature in Lila's sensory focus on silences; voice texture is distinct and rhythmic, modulating with pressure like shallow breaths, and sparse dialogue carries subtext naturally; minor filter verbs in reflection (e.g., "she’d learned") are voice-motivated without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in anticipatory countdown and textured silences; no major loops or artifacts, though occasional figurative stacks (e.g., "gilded hush" repetitions) add texture without muddle; propulsion advances through embodied images, with clean mechanics elevating the sprout's final reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of gravity inversion and silence-collecting transforms confinement tropes into a fresh angle on hope from loss; the sprout's emergence feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk in lyric ambiguity heightening stakes without gimmickry, though premise echoes sci-fi familiars slightly, grounded by specific sensory details.</comment>
