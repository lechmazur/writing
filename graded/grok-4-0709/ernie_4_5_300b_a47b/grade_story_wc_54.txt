<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lila's motivation as a curious intern drives consistent choices, with interiority embodied in her calculations and restlessness, culminating in the earned stasis of wearing the sextant as a pendant with the conceptual cost of an untested equation. Strengths include concrete traits shown through actions like rerouting conduits, avoiding stock phrasing. Minor weakness in repetitive emphasis on "functionally creative" without deeper contradictory impulses in scene, but it doesn't undermine the final renunciation of nostalgia for repurposing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through descriptive density and pattern breaks, like the hum's intensification, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the equation reweights decay into hope with felt cost in its rawness. Orientation anchors early in the abandoned terminal under twilight. One meaningful cadence shift suffices, with causality holding via motivated actions like prying the sextant free triggering the hum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport setting is vivid and purposeful, with shattered atrium and rusted carousels constraining Lila's exploration and charging the final image of moonlight pooling to illuminate the sextant. Sensory details like echoing boots and dust swirling integrate into action, reflecting her priorities. Environment evolves causally, mirroring internal restlessness without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of puzzling out hope tightens through one deepening when the sextant activates the hum, narrowing options to repurpose flows with conceptual cost in the untested equation. Pressure coheres under textural lens via accumulating vibrations, forcing stance crystallization. Weakness in stakes remaining somewhat abstract, lacking visceral trade-offs beyond the raw hypothesis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of repurposing fractured systems into hope emerges organically from events like rerouting conduits, culminating in the final image of the luminous equation offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in the sextant's constellations and terminal's decay invites reflection on lost truths. Strength in embracing complexity, avoiding tidy resolutions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable, with perceptual signature in engineering-focused noticing like structural calculations, and rhythmic control modulating with pressure in the hum's build-up. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets. Minor register drift in elevated phrases like "stoic wonder" feels slightly unmotivated for her lexicon, but elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose advances with high density in images like "moonlight pooled on the floor," varying rhythm purposefully, but paraphrase loops like repeating "functional creativity" and "redirected flows" create minor scaffold without payoff, dulling momentum slightly. No major artifacts touch closure, and information propels forward. Figurative language is controlled, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the hum's resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing engineering repurposing with cosmic relic to forge hope equations, feeling inevitable through Lila's traits, with risk in textural accumulation heightening stakes without gimmickry. Transforms exploration trope via functional creativity enabling the resurrection. Fresh angle on decay yielding beauty, committed fully without hedging.</comment>
