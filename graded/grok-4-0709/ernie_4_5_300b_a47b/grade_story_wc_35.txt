<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Nessar's motivation to temper memories is clear and intensifies through embodied interiority, with contradictory impulses evident in his hesitation at the pool before submerging hands; the final subsumption earns its cost via the gasped guilt overload, revealing value hierarchy without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, sensory patterns build density to a resonant reconfiguration at the pool, with felt cost in the founder's guilt surging; orientation anchors early in the fortress after rain, and structure holds with one transition to the kitchen without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, POV-filtered details like condensation on sandstone and arctic pavilion air constrain Nessar's choices and charge the lighter post-subsumption atmosphere; the desert rain after a decade mirrors internal remorse, evolving causally to support the sturdier fortress image at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of blunting remorse tightens through deepening pool interaction under textural lens, with agency in submerging hands forcing a trade-off; cost is unmistakable in the momentary guilt possession, narrowing options without coincidence resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of tempering remorse like spices emerges organically from images and motifs, culminating in a resonant cooking scene that reweights the premise non-literally; subtext in tidal patterns and diluted burden invites reflection on shared guilt without tidy morals or direct statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Close-third POV maintains consistent perceptual signature biased toward tastes and echoes, with rhythmic syntax modulating under pressure at the pool; no dialogue or elision issues, and voice texture feels singular without register drifts.</comment>
