<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marlow's motivation to confront collective grief is clear and intensifies through reflective choices, culminating in his poem-reading that forecloses silence with felt emotional cost; interiority is concrete via chisel-calloused hands and unspoken losses, avoiding stock phrasing mostly. However, internal conflict alternates summaries rather than simultaneous impulses in scene, slightly weakening embodiment under pressure. The single-POV focus excels in revealing values through micro-choices like unrolling the ribbon, with flaws complicating his endurance authentically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned reflections and migration cadence, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Marlow's poem reweights grief as a door with undeniable conceptual cost in the lantern's flare and voice's departure. Orientation anchors early in the greenhouse at dusk, with no disorientation debt. One meaningful deepening via ancestor stories tightens the stake sufficiently for length, though some ellipsis feels unmotivated without stronger linkage to tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse at dusk is vividly sensory with damp earth, rattling panes, and butterfly shadows, filtered through Marlow's POV to mirror grief; it constrains choices by housing the voice and migration, charging the final image of faded ribbon and lingering flight. Details evolve causally, like leaves crunching under boots, integrating into action without stalling. Micro-setting of the ribbon as object enhances specificity, though some rose scents feel slightly generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering grief's shape escalates accumulatively through migration density and voice interactions, deepening once via the poem question that reweights words as bridges, with legible cost in Marlow's heavy heart and family losses. Pressure coheres under Textural lens, forcing stance crystallization in the reading, though coincidence of butterflies complicates without resolving. One tightening suffices, but lacks a sharper trade-off in the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of grief as shared bridge emerges organically from poems, ribbon, and migration motifs, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via Marlow's poem that reweights loss to hope without moralizing. Subtext in voice whispers and lavender scents invites ambiguity, earning insight through specific struggles like retracing ancestors. Emotional aftereffect lingers honestly, avoiding sentimentality, though some direct statements like "words outlive us" border on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in twilight hues and chisel hands; voice modulates rhythmically, compressing under migration pressure without obscuring clarity. Dialogue with the voice feels natural, subtextual, advancing mentorship via indirection like "You're late." Elision of ghost presence is taught early and paid off in closure, with distinct idiom in Marlow's shaky poem versus the serene voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in flickering shadows and thundering calm; sentences propel via strong verbs, though occasional paraphrase loops like repeated grief weights dull momentum slightly. No major artifacts touch closure, but figurative stacks in migration description mix metaphors without full payoff. Opening anchors voice strongly, final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Spectral mentorship in a greenhouse with poem-trading family transforms grief tropes through specific ribbon and butterfly synthesis, feeling inevitable in the poem's door metaphor; risk in lyric accumulations heightens stakes without gimmickry. However, premise echoes familiar ghost-echo tales without bolder subversion, limiting freshness despite authentic emotional complexity.</comment>
