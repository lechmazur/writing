<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elric's motivation to understand safety's cost intensifies credibly through his silence and eventual speech, with embodied internal conflict shown in his hesitation and the bolt's weight; however, secondary characters like Lady Veyra apply pressure but lack depth, trending toward stock roles that slightly dilute relational crucibles.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds with patterned imagery building to a conceptual repricing in Elric's realization and speech, providing resonant closure with felt cost of breaking silence; orientation anchors early in the fortress, but minor ellipsis in the staircase revelation feels slightly unmotivated without stronger causal linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress under snow vividly constrains choices, with sensory details like frozen mercury walls and frostbite air mirroring Elric's internal thaw; the yellow stain on the staircase charges the final reconfiguration by mapping unspoken pacts, elevating specificity without overbreadth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of safety's cost tightens through Lady Veyra's scream and Elric's staircase reflection, culminating in his speech as a meaningful deepening under the textural lens; however, pressure feels somewhat static until the climax, with coincidence in the neglected bolt complicating without fully escalating agency-driven cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence versus courageous listening emerges organically from images like the bolt and stain, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in Elric's transformed role; the final image of the child playing piano offers resonant repricing without statement, though epiphanic lines like "safety is not a cage but a garden" verge on overtness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single-POV interiority maintains stable distance with perceptual bias in Elric's silent observations, and prose texture distinctively poetic yet controlled; dialogue is sparse but natural, with subtext in Lady Veyra's demand and Elric's rustle-like response advancing the shift without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose density shines in vivid metaphors like "walls glimmered like frozen mercury" propelling atmosphere without loops, though occasional overwriting in similes (e.g., "cloth so soft it seemed woven from moonlight") slightly muddles peak beats; rhythm varies naturally, supporting momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence as contract in a cobalt fortress transforms bellhop trope through specific imagery and thematic risk, feeling inevitable in Elric's vocal emergence; however, premise echoes familiar redemption arcs without bolder subversion, limiting ingenuity.</comment>
