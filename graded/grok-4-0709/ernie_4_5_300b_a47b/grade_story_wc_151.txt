<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and personal, intensifying from past letter to present discovery, with embodied emotions like trembling fingers and hitched breath revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. The final choice to continue her grandmother's work is earned through causal buildup, foreclosing anonymity with emotional cost shown in tears. Minor weakness in secondary characters' pressure, as the vendor's line feels ornamental without altering her stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under Causal lens, the structure flows with because/therefore linkages from chalk decoding to letter receipt and fountain discovery, culminating in an on-page Decisive Change where Lira commits to teaching, with felt emotional cost in the hologram reveal. Orientation anchors early in the arcade at dawn; persistent clipboard constraint shapes tactics throughout. Strength in the closure unit's legible before/after shift from pursuit to inheritance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The golden arcade at dawn is vividly specific, with sensory details like honeyed light and chalk spirals filtering through Lira's bias, constraining choices as the fountain holds the key and charges the final image. Micro-setting of the clipboard and fountain evolves causally, mirroring internal nostalgia. No white-room issues; details integrate into action without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding margins signals early and tightens once through the letter's arrival and fountain reveal, narrowing options under Causal lens with emotional cost legible in tears and crystallized motivation. Agency in Lira's active scanning and dipping hand drives escalation; one meaningful deepening suffices. Coincidence of the chip's placement complicates but doesn't resolve, as her methods earn the find.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of futuristic nostalgia emerges organically from chalk codes blending old and new, culminating in a resonant final image of reinventing the past without stated moral, reweighting the arcade as archive. Subtext in margins and phoenix seal invites reflection on endurance post-Collapse. Strength in the hologram's line earning the insight through struggle, avoiding platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Lira's kinetic focus on relics; no head-hopping or unwarranted certainty. Voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, image-rich prose modulating with pressure, like clicking boots as countdown. Brief dialogue feels natural and subtextual, advancing plot without exposition; elision in backstory anchors and tilts present stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm from descriptive openings to propulsive action, free of loops or scaffold; metaphors like "honeyed streaks" integrate without muddle. Strong verbs and specific nouns propel momentum, especially in the fountain climax. Minor register drift in phrases like "alphanumeric sequences" feels slightly academic but fits POV; no artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-Collapse mail with chalk encryption feels inevitable, transforming nostalgia tropes through Lira's pseudonym work and the arcade as archive. Risk in blending sci-fi relics with emotional inheritance heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh angle in the margins' language of survival, committed fully without hedging.</comment>
