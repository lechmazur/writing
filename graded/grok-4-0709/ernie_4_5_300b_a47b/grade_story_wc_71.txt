<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to understand living houses is clear and intensifies through her ritual, with embodied interiority in moments like inhaling the shard's scent revealing character under pressure. The final endurance of her theory feels earned by prior observations, foreclosing skepticism with a subtle conceptual cost in her smile of understanding. Strength lies in consistent traits shown through micro-choices, like arranging objects deliberately; weakness is mild stock phrasing in dream-derived insights that slightly dilute specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned object accumulation to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the hush becomes potential, with felt cost in the bay's transformed sanctity. Orientation anchors early in the quiet bay, avoiding penalties. Strength is the meaningful cadence shift at the glow, reweighting stakes; minor weakness in elliptical backstory that briefly loops without fully tilting present stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bay setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like lapping water and amber haze filtered through Lira's bias, subtly mirroring her internal quest. Environment constrains choices, as the shore amplifies hush in the ritual, charging the final image of pulsing houses. Strength in selective, POV-specific details evolving causally; no major weaknesses, though occupational depth is absent but not required.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding living houses signals early and deepens through object arrangement, with one meaningful cadence shift under Accumulative/Textural lens as the glow forces stance crystallization on hush as potential. Agency in Lira's ritual forecloses doubt with visible cost in the thickened air and trembling objects. Strength in coherent pressure without coincidence resolving; weakness in abstract stakes that feel less viscerally tested at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of unnoticed objects bridging mundane and ineffable emerges organically from Lira's actions and the ritual's glow, inviting reflection through ambiguity without confusion. Subtext in images like the shard's secret resonates, with the final image offering a non-literal answer reweighting displaced items as anchors. Strength in complexity avoiding tidy morals; minor weakness in near-explicit statements like "inadvertently profound" that border on assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Lira's subtle noticing, like the creaking swing's rhythm. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, deliberate syntax modulating with hush's thickening. No dialogue, so ignore those bullets; strength in consistent voice without elision issues; minor register drift in academic terms like "quantum physics" feels slightly unmotivated for her idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid lines like the shard "glinted faintly, as if holding a secret," varying rhythm naturally. No major loops or artifacts, though occasional figurative stacking in ritual description borders on overwriting without harming clarity. Strength in propulsion and strong verbs; weakness in one paraphrase loop around "displaced objects" that slightly dulls momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality in synthesizing folklore and physics into "hush anchors" via orris root feels fresh, transforming trope of found objects through Lira's specific worldview. Risk in lyric hush buildup heightens stakes organically without gimmickry. Strength in non-obvious synthesis inevitable at glow; weakness in premise echoing familiar magical realism without bolder subversion.</comment>
