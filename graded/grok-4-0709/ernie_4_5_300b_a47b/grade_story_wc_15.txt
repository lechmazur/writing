<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to mend the labyrinth with thread is clear and rooted in her traits as a poetic weaver, intensifying through embodied actions like humming and sewing despite raw fingers. Interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions shown through tactile details rather than labels, though internal contradictions are subtle rather than simultaneous in key scenes. The final endurance earns a felt cost in her effort and optimism, aligning with Earned Stasis under the textural lens. No second character, so relationship bullets ignored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, holding through density increases via threaded paths and a pattern break at the heart's mending, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the labyrinth revives with conceptual cost of lost illustrations. Orientation anchors early in the tide pools and entrance, with no disorientation debt. Closure lands on-page with the final stitch and tide pools refilling, reweighting ruin to reverence; one meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The labyrinth's red canyon walls and damp corridors vividly anchor the setting, with sensory details like scents and pulsing walls filtered through Lira's poetic bias, constraining her choices in junctions and chambers. Tide pools bookend the piece, evolving from empty to filling, mirroring the mending and charging the final image of reflection. Micro-setting of threads and plates integrates into action, subtly mirroring her internal hope without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mending the labyrinth signals early and deepens through textural accumulation of threads and encounters, narrowing options at the spiral junction with a felt cost in raw fingers and effort. Agency drives the sewing, leading to a stance crystallization in the heart, though pressure is more poetic than visceral reversal. One tightening via overlapping paths suffices, with coincidence in the sleepwalker complicating but not resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resilience through mending emerges organically from threaded images and the labyrinth's revival, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in "hauntingly optimistic" endurance. Subtext in symbols like spirals and glowing threads invites reflection, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights ruin without stating a thesis. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars like the empty plates, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature biased toward poetic, tactile noticing like tracing grooves and glowing threads. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, image-rich syntax that modulates with intensity, teaching patterned elision early and paying off at closure. No dialogue, so those bullets ignored; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "exhausted eyes" without loops or artifacts; syntax varies for propulsion, accelerating in sewing beats. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, with no muddle in peak moments like the final stitch. Opening anchors voice, final line recharges motifs with momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weaving, sleepwalking paths, and labyrinth mending transforms mythic tropes through Lira's specific optimism and threaded method, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk in poetic structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, committing to the premise's implications. No close echoes of famous scenes, with authenticity in voice and vision.</comment>
