<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies through embodied interiority, rooted in childhood stories and legacy, compelling her to renounce the negative in the fireplace with felt cost. Internal conflict shows in her trembling fingers and unsteady legs, revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. The single-POV focus excels without needing relationships, but some emotions lean toward poetic abstraction rather than raw embodiment in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned discoveries with coherent causality, anchoring orientation early in the ivy-veiled passage. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lira hears the whisper and smiles, reweighting her as the map with conceptual cost of carrying the burden. One meaningful deepening suffices, but ellipsis in the groan's resolution feels slightly under-motivated, though it pays off at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage constrains choices, pressuring Lira's exploration and charging the final alcove reveal; sensory details like wet earth and iron are vivid, POV-filtered, and evolve causally with the groan. Micro-setting of the fireplace and vines mirrors her internal state without overt symbolism. Environment directly shapes the closure image, meeting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering walls' dreams escalates through accumulative deepenings like finding diaries, tightening to the groan that narrows options with coherent pressure. Agency in placing the negative forecloses holding onto the past, with felt cost legible in her unsteady legs. Under Textural lens, one intensification suffices, but cost could be more viscerally embodied at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of legacy's burden emerges organically from discoveries and the final whisper, offering resonant non-literal answer that reweights Lira as the map without moralizing. Subtext in ivy and diaries enriches complexity, inviting reflection on memory and climate shifts. Ending reweights prior material effectively, meeting 9+ test, though some insights border on overt statement in diary quotes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Lira's sensitive echoes and vine textures, modulating rhythm under pressure like the amplified breath. Prose texture is purposeful and lyric, teaching patterned elision early with no head-hopping. Meets 9+ test with rhythmic control heightening the groan without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally in discoveries like sifting debris; no loops or scaffold, strong verbs propel momentum. Figurative language like "curved like a question mark" integrates without muddle, advancing atmosphere. Zero artifacts in closure, meeting 9+ test, though one mixed metaphor in "throat tightened" slightly distracts mid-beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography with living architecture and climate legacy feels organic, transforming tropes through specific details like the blank negative. Risk in lyric accumulations heightens stakes without gimmickry, with the whisper turn inevitable in hindsight. Core premise offers non-obvious angle, but echoes familiar gothic exploration motifs without full subversion.</comment>
