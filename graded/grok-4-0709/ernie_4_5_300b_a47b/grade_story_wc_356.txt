<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to grow the seed for serenity is clear and rooted in her ambitious traits, intensifying through doubts to compel a patient shift; interiority is concrete via scents and journaling, with embodied emotions in her dream realization of rushing; however, some stock phrasing like "ambition overshadowing" slightly flattens contradictory impulses; the final endurance earns stasis with felt cost in her resolved doubts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, journal entries and scent shifts build density toward a pattern break in the dream, culminating in resonant reconfiguration at the bloom with conceptual cost of tempered ambition; orientation anchors early in the treetop village; one meaningful deepening suffices, but predictability softens some causal links; the bloom's harmony reweights village energy legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The treetop village is vividly anchored with vines, lanterns, and mists, sensory details filtered through Lira's olfactory bias; setting mirrors her internal hush via walkways and light, charging the final bloom image; details evolve with seasons, constraining her gardening choices; minor overreliance on visual metaphors holds back perfection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of harmonizing village via flower tightens through dormant weeks and dream-induced shift, deepening under Accumulative lens to reweight patience with emotional cost of doubts; agency in her method adjustment drives escalation; stakes feel visceral in elder warnings, but lack a sharper reversal; the bloom forces stance crystallization without coincidence resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom in patience emerges organically from seed's growth and Lira's arc, with subtext in evolving doodles and scents; final bloom offers resonant, non-literal repricing of chaos and serenity as kin without moralizing; purposeful ambiguity lingers in her tempered ambition; avoids sentimentality but could deepen counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stays stable and modest, with perceptual signature in scent details and rhythmic prose modulating with emotional hush; minimal dialogue carries subtext in elders' warnings; purposeful compression in journal summaries pays off at closure; minor register drift in poetic flourishes slightly jars under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose density advances atmosphere via vivid scents and rhythms, with syntactic variety breathing in quiet moments; however, repetitive "journalized" and stacked metaphors like "vines draped like ancient tapestries" create minor loops in peak beats; clarity holds, but overwriting dulls propulsion slightly; final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Corpse flower in treetop village offers fresh synthesis of herbalism and patience, transforming growth tropes through scent-guided choices; emotional specificity in doubts feels authentic; risk in lyric hush heightens stakes organically; however, fairy-tale echoes lack bolder subversion.</comment>
