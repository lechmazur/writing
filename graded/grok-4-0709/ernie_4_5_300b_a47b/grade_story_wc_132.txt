<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation to study plants evolves credibly into a personal reluctance to change, with embodied interiority shown through her hesitation to touch the hellebore; contradictory impulses appear when she reaches out but withdraws, earning the final renunciation with felt cost of her control-oriented past. Mara's secondary pressure as assistant effectively crucibles this shift without overshadowing. Some interior phrasing borders on stock, like admiring resilience, slightly diluting specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, plant observations build density toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where Eleanor reweights her control, with conceptual cost legible in the final image of vines growing unchecked; orientation anchors early via the trellis and nursery. One meaningful cadence shift at the hellebore suffices for length, though minor ellipsis in storm transitions feels lightly unmotivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mossy trellis and post-rain nursery vividly anchor atmosphere, with sensory details like damp fibers and wet soil filtering through Eleanor's bias; the setting constrains her final choice by enabling the vines' overnight growth, charging the closure image. Micro-setting of the hellebore pot integrates action purposefully without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reluctant transformation tightens via the hellebore's retraction, deepening knowledge and forcing Eleanor's stance crystallization under Accumulative lens; agency in withdrawing her hand forecloses control with felt cost, though stakes remain somewhat abstract until the vines' arrival complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of sustaining transformation emerges organically from plant behaviors and Eleanor's arc, with subtext in gestures like tracing the linden leaf; the final image offers resonant repricing without moralizing, though direct statements like "transformation wasn’t something to resist" border on thematic echo, reducing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Close third-person POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature biased toward plant details; dialogue carries subtext and advances realization naturally, as in Mara's "Let it be" prompting withdrawal. Prose texture distinct in rhythmic, nature-infused syntax that heightens under pressure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose propels with varied rhythm and high density, integrating sensory images into action; minor paraphrase loops, like repeated "releasing control," appear in the ending but do not dull closure clarity. No major artifacts or overwrites obscure peaks, though some metaphors like "circuitously sincere" feel slightly strained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Core premise of plants teaching human transformation offers fresh inflection through specific nursery details and vine growth, transforming trope via Eleanor's occupation; however, epiphany arc echoes familiar self-realization tales without bold risk-taking to heighten stakes uniquely.</comment>
