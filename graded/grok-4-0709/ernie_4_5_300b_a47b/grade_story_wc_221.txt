<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elio's motivation as a questioning pariah intensifies credibly, with interiority showing contradictory impulses like restlessness turning to resolve, embodied in his trembling hand during the glimpse; the grandmother's appearance pressures a micro-choice, but her translucent status limits relational crucible depth without penalty at this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned glimpses and reflections to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Elio reweights confusion as freedom, with felt emotional cost in the grandmother's fading; orientation anchors early on the deck, and causality holds via motif accumulation without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The time dilation deck vividly constrains perception and enables the glimpse, charging the final image as Elio descends; sensory details like frosted glass and humming machinery filter through POV bias, mirroring internal chaos without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of navigating temporal confusion tightens once through the prolonged glimpse, forcing stance crystallization under Situational pressure (hybrid lens note), with agency in path choice foreclosing isolation at emotional cost; lacks a second deepening but sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of confusion as exploration emerges organically from glimpses and sketches, culminating in resonant final image without moralizing; subtext in the compass rose implies ambiguity, earning insight through dramatized memory without platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person POV with perceptual signature in warped constellations and syrupy time; voice texture modulates rhythmically under stress, and grandmother's dialogue carries subtext naturally, advancing the thematic shift without register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose propels with high density and varied rhythm, like "time dilated like syrup," advancing atmosphere without loops; minor figurative stack in sky descriptions avoids muddle, and final line resolves cleanly by recharging the compass motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time dilation with personal ritual transforms exile trope through specific motifs like meteorite ink, heightening stakes organically; risks lyric compression but commits fully without gimmickry, though premise echoes sci-fi standards modestly.</comment>
