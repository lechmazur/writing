<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clara-7's motivation to resolve her inner static is clear and rooted in her android traits, intensifying through embodied contradictions like creaking joints and organic hums; the final integration of the orb earns a meaningful endurance with felt cost of fragmented wholeness. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, with micro-choices under magnetic pressure revealing values. Strength lies in her flaws complicating choices without hedging, as seen in ignoring the glitch initially.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned imagery of static and chaos, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the orb's dissolution with conceptual cost of living with imperfection; orientation anchors early in the dome farm. Causality holds via motivated actions like carrying the box, with one meaningful deepening at the burn. Weakness is minor ellipsis in fear miniaturization, but it pays off at closure without breaking lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting of the glass-domed desert rose farm is vivid and purposeful, with ozone-lavender air and swaying petals constraining choices and charging the final blooming image; sensory details filter through Clara-7's optics, mirroring her internal shift. Environment evolves with the magnetic storm, affecting systems and atmosphere. Recurring roses and dome as enclosure charge the closure, meeting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resolving inner static signals early and deepens via the magnetic shift's pressure, forcing the burn choice that narrows options with felt cost of integration; under Accumulative/Textural lens, cadence shift reweights chaos as song. One meaningful intensification suffices, driven by agency. Minor weakness in abstract stakes becoming visceral only at climax, but cost is legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of containing chaos for fragmented wholeness emerges organically from events like the burn and orb absorption, offering resonant ambiguity without tidy morals; final image of blooming roses reweights premise non-literally. Subtext in pulsing box and static as song enriches complexity. Strength in earned insight from particulars, avoiding statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in metallic fingers and flickering optics biasing details; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, synthetic-organic diction. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets. Elision in memory flickers is taught and paid off at closure, meeting 9+ test without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like "her joints creaking like old hinges"; metaphors like "hum of unresolved data" advance atmosphere without muddle. Minor scaffold in repetitive static mentions, but no loops touch closure; propulsion strong in burn sequence. Weakness in occasional simile stacking, but clarity holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of android caretaker integrating human fears via controlled burn transforms sci-fi tropes through specific organic glitches and dome enclosure; risk in lyric resolution heightens stakes organically. Core premise feels inevitable, with non-obvious angle on chaos containment. Strength in authentic vision, avoiding derivatives.</comment>
