<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to foster interspecies respect is clear and rooted in her terminal diagnosis, driving consistent micro-choices like wrapping the wire despite rumbling displeasure; interiority is embodied through tactile actions and whispers, showing contradictory impulses of calm resolve amid pain. The spirit's secondary pressure heightens her endurance, culminating in an earned stasis at death with felt cost. Minor slip in over-articulated mantra repetition slightly hedges emotional rawness, but it doesn't undermine the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure builds through because/therefore linkages from wire-wrapping to spirit manifestation and acceptance, with orientation anchored early in the temple orchard; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via the aligned heartbeats and Lira's peaceful death, with visible cost in her final breath. One meaningful tightening at dusk escalates effectively, though the rumbling displeasure feels slightly under-motivated without immediate causal trigger.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The temple orchard with living stone pillars is vividly specific, constraining choices like branch selection and charging the final image of humming stone and wire; sensory details like dappled gold and pulsing warmth evolve with actions, mirroring Lira's internal harmony. Environment pressures the remodel, supplying resources that affect outcome without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of remodeling for interspecies respect tightens meaningfully at dusk, narrowing options as light erupts and the spirit questions, forcing Lira's stance crystallization with felt cost in her tightening chest and impending death. Under Causal lens, pressure coheres through her agency, though coincidence of spirit appearance slightly complicates without fully resolving. One deepening suffices, with moral calculus between pain and bridge-building sharpening the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of bridging human-spirit divides through symbiosis emerges organically from wire-wrapped oaks and spirit dialogue, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the aligned heartbeats and Lira's sigh, reweighting pain as a language without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like touching the stone adds complexity, inviting reflection on acceptance amid mortality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-specific, with perceptual signature in Lira's tactile focus on runes and pulses; voice texture modulates rhythmically, from murmured mantras to calm whispers under pressure. Dialogue carries subtext, advancing plot through implication like "pain can be a language too," distinguishing idioms without convergence. No head-hopping or unwarranted certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the dusk climax's eruption of light; metaphors like "liquid sun" are controlled without muddle, advancing atmosphere. Minor template cadence in repeated "she" openings in action beats deducts slightly, but no loops obscure closure, and propulsion remains strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of terminal illness with spirit-bridging via copper-wired oaks transforms familiar dying-wisdom tropes through specific architectural secrets, feeling inevitable in the spirit's softening edges. Risk in brazen calm tone heightens stakes organically, though premise echoes eco-spiritual tales without bolder subversion.</comment>
