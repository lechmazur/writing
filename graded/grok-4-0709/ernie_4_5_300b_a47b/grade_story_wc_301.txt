<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as a truth-seeking chronicler is clear and intensifies through her methodical transcription, leading to an earned endurance of guilt with felt cost in her trembling hands and new heart map; interiority is concrete and embodied, like tracing grooves to bridge soul gaps, avoiding stock phrasing; however, the emotional progression borders on tidy self-forgiveness without deeper contradictory impulses in the peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned graffiti discoveries to a resonant Conceptual Repricing in the final "Begin" graffiti and heart-map drawing, with conceptual cost of surrendering to messy flow; orientation anchors early in the disused station; one meaningful deepening suffices, but the ellipsis from stall to outside feels slightly unmotivated without stronger causal linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The disused railway station with ivy is vividly specific, constraining choices like following the drainpipe to the tributary, and charges the final image with gilded ivy and glowing graffiti; sensory details like damp earth and rust are purposeful, mirroring Mara's internal stagnation, and the micro-setting of graffiti walls guides her emotional navigation without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping regrets escalates texturally through graffiti accumulations, tightening to a deepening realization that healing requires surrender, with felt cost in her trembling hands and foreclosed stagnation; one cadence shift at the tributary suffices, driven by agency in playing the accordion; coincidence of new graffiti complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of self-forgiveness as a meandering river emerges organically from graffiti particulars like "Forgiveness isn’t a destination—it’s a current," culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the heart map and "Begin"; subtext in ivy as archive enriches without overt statement; avoids tidy morals, embracing ambiguity in ongoing flow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Mara's river-biased noticing, like ripples distorting arches; prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, metaphorical syntax that modulates with solace; no dialogue, so policy skips; minor register drift in abstract phrases like "labyrinth of her regrets" slightly jars but doesn't obscure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "ivy that clawed at the cracked brickwork like a thousand green fingers"; rhythm varies naturally, but occasional paraphrase loops, such as repeating forgiveness metaphors, dull momentum slightly; no major artifacts touch closure, though some overwriting in peak beats like the accordion playing adds minor scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of river chronicling with emotional graffiti mapping transforms familiar regret tropes through specific, grounded choices like the tributary overlook and accordion chords; risk in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the "Begin" reprise; avoids derivative premises by committing to raw, unmedicated perception.</comment>
