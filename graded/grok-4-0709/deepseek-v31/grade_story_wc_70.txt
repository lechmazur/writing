<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arawn's involuntary truthfulness is concretely embodied in his spoken admissions, revealing internal contradictions like fear of the box that intensify under pressure and culminate in the earned choice to prioritize hives over lights. The trait constrains actions without stock phrasing, and his micro-choices, such as brushing the box and admitting fear, show a hierarchy of values with visible cost in the blackout's persistence. Solitude fits the single-POV scope, but the grandfather's influence feels slightly summarized rather than dramatized mid-crisis. The final opening of the box earns stasis by foreclosing routine with personal wonder, though emotional embodiment could layer more contradictory impulses in the descent beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages from blackout to riddle discovery to battery choice, anchoring orientation early in the tower setting and blackout timeframe without disorientation. Closure lands as a decisive change in activating the hives, with resonant reconfiguration via the empty box's honey smell repricing wonder over function, carrying felt cost in the city's ongoing darkness. One meaningful tightening suffices, as the riddle motivates the descent and forces the trade-off. Minor slip in the matchbox's convenient spill, but it pays off without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tower setting constrains choices vividly, with the iron skeleton and grounding plate pressuring the descent and battery decision, while sensory details like silent conduits and nectar-dusk sky filter through Arawn's diagnostic POV to mirror isolation. Micro-setting of the console and box integrates into action, charging the final image of the flickering lantern and honey smell. Atmosphere evolves causally from dimming sky to returning hum, supporting theme without overt symbolism. The environment directly shapes the climax by housing the hidden battery, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under the causal lens, the dominant stake of resolving the blackout tightens meaningfully through the riddle's pressure, narrowing options to a trade-off between lights and hives, with agency in Arawn's choice driving escalation. Cost is legible in the city's continued darkness versus revived life, forcing stance crystallization without coincidence resolving it. One deepening suffices, but the internal fear admission feels like a micro-turn that could interweave more sharply with external pressure. The moral calculus between function and wonder sharpens the peak, though stakes remain somewhat abstract until the battery connection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of preserving wonder amid routine emerges organically from the box, riddle, and hive choice, with the empty box's honey smell offering a resonant, non-literal repricing of life's value over mere power. Subtext in silences and implications, like the unopened box's anticipation, invites reflection on fear and truth without tidy morals. Emotional aftereffect arises from the smile at honey's faint smell, avoiding sentimentality through concrete particulars. The final image reweights the premise without stating a moral, meeting the 9+ test, though counter-readings could be more ambiguously layered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable, with perceptual signature in Arawn's diagnostic noticing of silent hums and conduits, modulating rhythm under stress like the unbidden truth admission. Voice texture is distinct in poetic yet grounded diction, such as "nectar dusk," consistent without register drift. Dialogue is minimal but natural in self-spoken truths advancing introspection; no head-hopping or unmotivated elision. Prose as character reflects his candid solitude, though peak stress could compress syntax more for urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the opening sky description and the riddle's cryptic flow, advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language, such as "spilled honey and wine," is purposeful and coherent, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the battery choice. Information propels forward, with strong verbs and specific nouns; no artifacts touch closure, meeting the 9+ test. Minor template cadence in diagnostic checks, but it serves momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes lightning towers, drone hives, and truth-telling with fresh ingenuity, transforming solitude tropes through the riddle's organic integration and the wonder-preserving choice. Risk in the empty box's reveal heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable via grandfather's legacy. Emotional specificity in the honey smell avoids generics, though the blackout-hive link echoes familiar eco-dystopias without bolder subversion. A non-obvious moral calculus between light and life elevates it, but proximity to riddle-box archetypes caps higher bands.</comment>
