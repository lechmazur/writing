<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as a gossip-column exorcist is clear and intensifies through her apology, rooted in consistent traits like metaphorical advising that compel the climax; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion in her handling of the bottle and currents. The ghost's weary understanding reveals character under pressure, though secondary, with status dynamics legible in their exchange. Flaws complicate her choices, earning the resolution with felt cost in the dawn's roar. The final apology moment embodies contradictory impulses, satisfying the 9+ test but capped by minor stock phrasing in her self-reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural, holding through density increase via metaphors and energy currents to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the ghost unravels with conceptual cost of imperfect miracles, felt in the orchard's end and the sliding nocturne. Orientation anchors early in the archive's silence and scent, with no debt. Causality builds through motivated actions like uncorking the bottle leading to the ghost's slowdown, shaping tactics with persistent constraint of the impending dawn. The cost proof is legible in the ghost's metaphorical forgiveness and Elara's alone stance, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sheet music archive anchors vividly with decaying paper and unsung notes, constraining choices like drawing on latent energy for currents; sensory details are selective, POV-biased through Elara's trade, mirroring her internal regret via the orchard's terminal bloom. The environment evolves causally with the dawn saws, charging the final image of the sliding nocturne. Micro-setting of the bottle and phantom piano affects action tactilely. This constrains the ritual choice and charges closure, passing the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of delivering the apology tightens through the ritual's currents, deepening via the ghost's shudder and turn, narrowing options with the orchard's impending grief as coherent pressure under the textural lens. Agency in Elara's conducting forecloses paths with felt cost in the release's melancholy. One meaningful intensification suffices, driven by her choices, but coincidence of the sliding sheet slightly complicates without resolving. Cost is unmistakable in the ghost's unraveling, but minor abstraction in stakes caps below 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect miracles emerges from events like the metaphor exchange and ghost's roots analogy, integrating with the core concept through Elara's fractured story admission, inviting reflection via ambiguity in apologies' cuts. Subtext in gestures like stilled hands and unraveling elicits emotional aftereffect without sentimentality. The final nocturne image offers a resonant, non-literal answer reweighting scandals as flawed works, passing the 9+ test. Complexity resists tidy morals, with organic emergence from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Elara's noticing of scents and silences biased by her trade; voice texture distinct in rhythmic, metaphorical prose modulating with intensity. Dialogue is natural, subtextual in the ghost's rustle-like whisper pursuing forgiveness indirectly. No head-hopping or elision issues; diction fits lexicon without drift. Distinct signature and control under pressure meet 9+ test, but minor filter verb in "watching him" prevents higher.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere and character via vivid images like "flickered, a photograph bleached by time"; rhythm varies naturally, syntax propels without loops or scaffold. No artifacts in closure; metaphors coherent and purposeful, like roots feeding growth. Opening anchors stakes, final line resolves with resonant image. Zero loops and propulsion pass 9+ test, with exemplary control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of exorcism via metaphors and currents transforms gossip trope through specific details like rosin-scented bottle and orchard grief, feeling inevitable in the apology's release. Emotional truth in weary forgiveness offers fresh angle on legacy scandals. Risk in ethereal grit heightens stakes organically. Non-obvious yet hindsight-inevitable, with +0.3 risk bonus, but no bold structural subversion caps at band edge.</comment>
