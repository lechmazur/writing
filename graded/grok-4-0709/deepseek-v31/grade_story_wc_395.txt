<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to uncover deleted files' fate is clear and intensifies through persistent investigation, rooted in her trait of bright attentiveness that compels higher-stakes choices like bypassing encryption. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions in moments like her deep breath before decryption, revealing contradictory impulses of curiosity and fear. The final realization earns a meaningful change in understanding, foreclosing ignorance with a felt conceptual cost. No second character, so relationship bullets are ignored; overall, flaws are minimal but include occasional stock phrasing in emotional descriptions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, the structure builds through because/therefore linkages, from routine check to pattern discovery to encrypted file, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing closure where the truth reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost in the looming presence. Orientation anchors who (Elara), where (data vault), and when (present with historical ties) early, avoiding penalties. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length, with the transmission revealing the anomaly as the decisive change. Strength lies in motivated ellipsis that narrows options, like numbers leading to the sub-archive; no major causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The social network archive setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like server hum and screen glow filtered through Elara's POV, constraining her choices by providing data streams for investigation. Atmosphere builds a sensed absence that mirrors internal unease, evolving causally as discoveries deepen. A recurring object (the virtual patch) charges the final image as a gateway, meeting the 9+ test. Minor weakness in occasional generic descriptors, but details integrate into action without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, the dominant stake of uncovering the truth escalates through tightenings like cross-referencing numbers to the Icarus Prime, narrowing options and raising costs via corporate lies. One meaningful deepening—the transmission's revelation—forces stance crystallization with legible conceptual cost in the terrifying truth. Agency drives escalation, as Elara's decisions bypass restrictions, earning the resolution. Strength in moral calculus between curiosity and danger, but stakes occasionally feel abstract until the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of digital afterlife and erased truths emerges organically from events like the pattern in data and the transmission, inviting reflection on corporate culpability without direct statements. Subtext in images like the patch's void resonates, offering a non-literal answer in the final reconfiguration of absence as presence. Emotional aftereffect is concrete, avoiding sentimentality through complexity. The ending reweights prior material effectively, meeting the 9+ test, though ambiguity is well-handled without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Elara's data-focused noticing, like patterns in timestamps; distance shifts intentionally with emotional intensity. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, investigative flow, with purposeful compression in discoveries. No dialogue, so those bullets ignored; voice modulates under pressure without register drift. Minor elision in transitions is taught and paid off, but occasional filter verbs slightly dull immediacy in peak moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing story through vivid sentences like the transmission's static-filled audio; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops or scaffold. Figurative language, such as the patch radiating absence, is controlled without muddle, supporting momentum. No major artifacts, but minor redundancy in describing numbers' recurrence slightly slows one beat. Final line recharges motifs effectively, with clean grammar and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise transforms sci-fi tropes of lost ships and data ghosts through specific synthesis of corporate archives and recurring numbers as breadcrumbs, feeling inevitable in Elara's discovery. Risk-taking in the conceptual horror of absorption heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth in the looming presence offers fresh inflection on deletion. Minor derivative echo of digital afterlife concepts, but grounded details personalize it.</comment>
