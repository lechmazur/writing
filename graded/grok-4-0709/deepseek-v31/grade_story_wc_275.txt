<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her father's legacy, intensifying to compel her final choice with embodied contradictions like her shaking hand over the thorny stem. Interiority is concrete and particular, showing internal conflict through micro-choices under pressure without stock phrasing. The resolution earns her endurance by foreclosing hiding from chaos, with a felt cost of carrying the weight. Minor summary in backstory slightly dilutes immediacy but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Structure builds causally from ritual to discovery to decision under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with patterned elision in reflections that pay off at closure. Orientation anchors early in the dome after the tower's fall, serving the resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands as a Charged Poise in her decision to carry the chip as a seed, with legible conceptual cost of mending chaos. One meaningful deepening at finding the box tightens options without redundancy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting of the glass dome is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like crimson blossoms mirroring Elara's internal tranquility and fragility.

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving peace versus confronting truth signals early and deepens once through the box discovery, narrowing options under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Pressure coheres internally, with a meaningful tightening at the tremor of fear that forces stance crystallization. Cost is felt in her choice to carry the weight, foreclosing her fragile oasis. No coincidences resolve; agency drives the resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of weaving continuity through chaos emerges organically from images like the sandbag scrap and roses, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer at the ending without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like pressing the scrap to soil invites reflection on resilience amid violence. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through complex ambiguity in her inheritance. Final image reweights the premise with conceptual cost, inextricable from her arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, filtering through Elara's bias toward flowers and silence without head-hopping.

No dialogue, so policy skips; free indirect style is clean and voice-motivated. Purposeful compression in reflections tilts stance without withholding known facts.</comment>
