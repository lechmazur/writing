<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Leo's motivation as a phobia-ridden stunt double is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in betrayal that forces higher-stakes choices like diving into the ocean; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in his trembling hands and gut-churning dread during gear preparation. The final transformation earns its endurance by foreclosing his old self with visible emotional cost, as in gasping and weeping upon surfacing. Strength lies in flaws complicating choices without safety-hedging, avoiding stock personalities through specific stunt-rig adaptability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, because/therefore linkages drive the plot from betrayal to decryption to the dive, with motivated ellipsis in time jumps that narrow options; orientation anchors early in the rusted library under stars. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost in the surfacing gasp and weep, pointing to the clutched case as an anchor to his new self. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length, though minor redundancy in whisper motifs slightly softens propulsion without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars is vividly specific, with salt-tinged night and decaying shelves mirroring Leo's decay and refuge; the ocean setting constrains his phobic choice, charging the final image of surfacing with the case. Sensory details are purposeful, filtered through POV bias under stress, like the headlamp's feeble beam in the murk. Environment evolves causally, from dome to boat to abyss, guiding action without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of facing oceanic phobia to retrieve evidence signals early and tightens once through the dive decision, narrowing options under Causal lens pressure; cost is legible in the sob-like breath and weeping surfacing, forcing stance crystallization. Agency in renunciation of fear avoidance forecloses safety with felt price, though coincidence of the child's cast clue complicates without resolving. Moral calculus sharpens the peak between vulnerability and power, interweaving internal conflict effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability as power emerges organically from betrayal and the dive, with subtext in the shell's whisper shifting from lie to truth; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars like the clutched case as anchor, embracing complexity without tidy binaries. Minor weakness in overt thematic echo, as in "vulnerability is power, not the weakness," slightly undercuts implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature biased toward adaptive hands and phobic terror; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, image-rich syntax that modulates with stress, like shortened sentences in the descent. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; purposeful compression in time jumps is taught and pays off at closure without elision issues. Prose as character reflects Leo's mind under pressure, avoiding register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in metaphors like "transformative acid" and "disposable echo" creates slight figurative muddle without harming clarity; no major loops or artifacts obscure cause/effect. Sentences advance story through concrete images, like scraping glitter with the shell, though occasional synonym churn (e.g., "raw and new-born thing") dulls momentum slightly. Final line resolves resonantly, recharging the shell motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stunt double's phobia with betrayal and oceanic dive transforms familiar facing-fears trope through specific details like the smudged cast and shell; non-obvious angle feels inevitable, with risk in embracing vulnerability heightening stakes. Core premise commits without retreat, avoiding stock archetypes via adaptive trait's tradeoffs. Minor derivative echo in mentor-betrayer dynamic, but grounded choices personalize it.</comment>
