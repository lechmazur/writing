<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aveline's motivation to read scars is concrete and intensifies through her telepathic tunneling, revealing internal contradictions in her wound-opening habits; emotions are embodied in her shaking and pain, with the final unwrapping showing earned reconfiguration via micro-choices. The plant telepathy trait feels character-specific, amplifying her flaws without stock phrasing. Minor slip in over-articulated revelation at "the acute ache of revelation," but it doesn't undermine the closure's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through sensory and memorial layers to a Conceptual Repricing closure where scars become seals of healing, with felt cost in pain and revelation legible in the final unwrapping; orientation anchors early in the tower at dawn post-anesthesia. Density increases via the tunneling sequence, reweighting knowledge without causality breaks. Strong hold on lens, though the miracle's displacement feels slightly elliptical without fuller causal linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tower at dawn anchors vividly with sensory specificity like cold quiet and ivy shuddering, constraining choices via the plants' network that enables tunneling; the bedside objects (cup, hourglass) charge the final image of unwrapping, mirroring internal states through purposeful detail. Micro-setting of the bandaged arm functions as environment, evolving causally. No white-room issues; atmosphere supports the meteor hush tone intentionally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding scars tightens through the tunneling deepening, reweighting options with the displaced miracle realization; under Accumulative lens, pattern break in the ivy's sprout thought forces stance crystallization with visible pain cost. Agency via mental reaching and unwrapping forecloses prior misbeliefs. Coherent pressure, though coincidence of plant memory complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of scars as healing seals emerges organically from coffee ring examination and tunneling, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the ivy's personal miracle that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in images like the emptying hourglass invites ambiguity on displaced goodness. Emotional aftereffect honest, avoiding sentimentality in the acute revelation ache.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Close third-person POV stable with perceptual signature in plant whispers and scar focus, diction textured and rhythmic under pressure like "viscous tendrils of anesthesia receding"; no dialogue, but prose reflects focalizer's mind with purposeful compression in tunneling. Elision in memory access taught early and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose dense with propulsion, varying rhythm in metaphors like "meteor hush" without loops or scaffold; high information density advances atmosphere and character, as in the hourglass emptying at revelation. No artifacts obscure closure; figurative language coherent and voice-motivated, accelerating in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of plant telepathy and displaced miracles transforms scar-reading trope through specific choices like coffee ring method, feeling inevitable in the tunneling turn; risk in lyric introspection heightens stakes without gimmickry. Original angle on healing avoids generics, committing to premise with authenticity.</comment>
