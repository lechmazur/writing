<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation shifts credibly from resignation to action through embodied emotion and the ribbon's thorn-like memory, revealing contradictory impulses in her quiet reflection versus decisive handover; Lyra's feistiness pressures this change, creating a crucible relationship with visible generational cost. The final renunciation of her "beautiful prison" feels earned by prior causality, foreclosing isolation with felt emotional price. Minor slip in Lyra's arc feeling slightly stock, but it doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure flows with because/therefore linkages from the decree's arrival to Lyra's storm-prompted confrontation, culminating in a Decisive Change where the apple handover delays demolition; orientation anchors early in the cathedral orchard. Closure lands on-page with conceptual cost of pruning Elara's rooted life, reconfiguring options. Persistent constraint of age brittles initial motivation, shaping tactics toward wisdom-bridging without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lush orchard in cathedral rafters constrains Elara's isolation and charges the final apple as a symbol of unlikely growth, mirroring internal states through sunlight dapple and unharvested fruit. Sensory details like rustling leaves and mossy pews filter through POV bias, evolving causally to pressure the handover. Environment directly shapes the closure image, with roots woven through statues embodying the prison metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving wisdom escalates causally from decree to Lyra's arrival, tightening through ribbon memory that forces stance crystallization; one meaningful deepening narrows options, with felt cost in Elara's hurt rooting her like trees. Agency in the handover forecloses passivity, though coincidence of Councillor's recognition slightly complicates without resolving. Moral calculus between deciduous and evergreen vows sharpens the peak choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of bridging wisdom emerges organically from deciduous vows metaphor and ribbon relic, resisting tidy morals through ambiguity in mother-daughter hurt; subtext in the apple's sweetness reweights growth in unlikely places. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer to generational blindness without stated moral. Emotional aftereffect lingers via accidental wisdom, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV stays stable in Elara, with perceptual signature in softened quartz-eyes and leaf-rustle voice; dialogue carries subtext, like Lyra's feisty cries pursuing persistence while Elara evades with wisdom. Rhythmic control heightens pressure in the handover without elision issues. Distinct idioms distinguish characters under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose propels with varied rhythm and high density, like "sharp thorn" embodying memory without loops; final line recharges motifs cleanly. Minor scaffold in upended bag description, but no artifacts dull closure. Syntactic variety supports beats, with strong verbs like "twisted" advancing action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of quartz-eye mending in a rafter orchard transforms familiar generational tropes through specific, non-obvious details like ribbon-adorned apple; risk in lyric wisdom heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight, with fresh angle on vows avoiding derivative premises.</comment>
