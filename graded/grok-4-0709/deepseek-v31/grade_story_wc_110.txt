<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Anya's motivation is clear and intensifies from curiosity to ethical dilemma, rooted in her reverence for the archive's veracity, culminating in a meaningful renunciation with felt cost to her duty; interiority is concrete and embodied, showing contradictory impulses in her decision to burn the logbook rather than log it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through layered discoveries to a resonant reconfiguration in the incineration act, with conceptual cost legible in her shifted view of honesty; orientation anchors early in the archive setting, and closure lands on-page with undeniable pressure, though the ellipsis to the forecourt feels slightly soft.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The archive's hushed corridors and rain-sheeting forecourt vividly anchor atmosphere, with sensory details like droplet percussion and humming crystals constraining Anya's reflective choice and charging the final incineration image; micro-setting of the lens and logbook integrates purposefully without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of archival truth versus mercy tightens through the lens revelation, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in her conscience; one meaningful deepening suffices, but coincidence of the misfiled logbook complicates without fully resolving, aligning with Situational allowance under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of honesty as mercy emerges organically from discoveries and the final act, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the manager's potential confession; the lens's "purer, kinder light" offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual bias toward sacred hush, and prose texture distinct in rhythmic, image-rich syntax; no dialogue, but elision in reflective blocks is taught and pays off at closure without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in descriptive beats like the rain's percussion, though minor figurative stacking in the lens metaphor borders on muddle without harming clarity; no loops or artifacts obscure the incineration climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival duty and ethical mercy through the projector lens as truth metaphor feels inevitable, transforming trope of hidden ledgers with bold risk in destruction act that heightens stakes organically.</comment>
