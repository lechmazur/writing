<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and intensifies through embodied shame and factual insulation, culminating in an earned resolution that forecloses his insulated path with visible emotional cost; interiority is concrete and particular, as in the "metallic taste of public failure" coating his tongue. Internal conflict shows contradictory impulses in scene, like touching the cloth while avoiding work. The brief secondary character Hendricks applies relevant pressure without depth, fitting the scope. Flaws complicate choices authentically, avoiding stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through reflective shards to a resonant reconfiguration in the final realization, with conceptual cost of lost years legible on the page; orientation anchors early in the trailer. Causality holds via motivated discoveries, like wresting the case, leading to the letters' reveal. One meaningful deepening suffices, but minor redundancy in inventorying the cloth slightly dilutes propulsion without harming closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The quarry office trailer and shed are vividly specific, with sensory details like rock dust and diesel ghosts filtered through Silas's POV; the environment constrains choices, as the shed's tangle forces wresting the case, charging the final image of the cloth through the window. Tone tensions the theme purposefully. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding purpose after loss signals early and deepens once through the letters' discovery, narrowing options with the cost of confronting unfulfilled lives; under Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure accumulates via details to crystallize stance. Agency in resolution via realization feels earned, though coincidence of finding the case complicates without resolving. One tightening suffices, with moral calculus sharpening the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of rediscovering purpose after applause emerges organically from particulars like the unfinished song and letters, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer that reweights insulation as costly; subtext in objects and silences invites reflection without confusion. Emotional aftereffect arises from concrete struggle, avoiding sentimentality. No overt moralizing, with ambiguity lingering meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward factual details like "polyester blend, mid-70s manufacture"; voice texture distinct in rhythmic, introspective prose modulating with emotion. Brief dialogue from Hendricks feels natural and advances plot subtly. No head-hopping or register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally and advancing atmosphere through images like "cathedral of rust"; minor scaffold in repetitive factual insulation, but no loops or artifacts obscure closure. Strong verbs and specific nouns propel beats, with clean mechanics. Final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of roadie past with antiques appraisal transforms tropes through specific details like the grille cloth and unfinished song, feeling inevitable; risk in quiet, reflective structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional complexity avoids generics, with authentic vision cohering. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
