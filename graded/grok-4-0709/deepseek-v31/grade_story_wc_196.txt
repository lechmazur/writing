<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to contextualize grief through archiving is clear and intensifies compellingly, with embodied emotions like rubbing temples and breath catching showing contradictory impulses in scene. The shift from penance to excavation feels earned by the letter's discovery, foreclosing pure sorrow with a felt cost of opening his heart. Interiority avoids stock phrasing, grounding in specific actions like handling the button, revealing values with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through layered discoveries with coherent pressure toward Conceptual Repricing closure, where Elias reweights his work with undeniable emotional cost in the final image. Orientation anchors early in the file room, with no disorientation debt. One meaningful deepening via the letter suffices, but lacks a persistent constraint shaping tactics beyond the button, limiting to sub-9.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The foster care file room anchors vividly with dusty boxes and slanted light, constraining choices like retrieving the button and integrating into action to mirror Elias's internal shift. Sensory details are selective and POV-biased, evolving causally with discoveries. A recurring object (button) charges the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of contextualizing grief escalates through textural density of file details, with one meaningful deepening at the letter forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative lens. Agency via endurance reconfigures options with felt emotional cost, but coincidence of finding the button complicates without fully resolving, holding back higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of magnifying small kindnesses amid loss emerges organically from the soldier's act and Elias's realization, offering a resonant non-literal answer that reweights unknown histories without moralizing. Subtext in images like the tarnished button invites reflection on transient care. Final image recharges prior grief with complexity, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in reverent movements and dust patterns, modulating rhythm under emotional pressure. Prose texture feels character-specific, with no dialogue to evaluate. Elision of soldier's name is purposeful and paid off in thematic anonymity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally and avoiding loops, though occasional figurative density like "clenched fist of sadness" borders on muddle without harming clarity. Sentences propel through discoveries, with strong verbs and specific details advancing atmosphere. No artifacts touch closure, but peak beats could trim minor scaffold for propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Civil War artifact in modern archiving transforms abandonment tropes through Elias's emotional arc, feeling inevitable with risk in quiet introspection heightening stakes. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on grief via bureaucratic excavation. Lacks bold structural risk for higher band.</comment>
