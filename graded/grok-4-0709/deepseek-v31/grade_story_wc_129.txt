<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly from isolation to communal grafting, with embodied emotions like the "luminescent ache" revealing contradictory impulses of frustration and curiosity in the arbor encounter. Interiority is concrete and character-specific, avoiding stock phrasing, and the final renunciation of finding the artist feels earned by prior discoveries with a felt cost in the collective glow. Secondary characters, though present, apply pressure through shared curiosity, forging relationships as a crucible that alters community state by the end. Minor weakness in group members reading as somewhat undifferentiated, but it doesn't undermine the protagonist's arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure accumulates tags into a pattern that reweights the stake of community and history, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Kaelin dedicates the arbor with a visible cost in the transformed ache. Orientation anchors who (Kaelin), where (crystalline orchard), and when (present-day settlement) by the first sentence, with no disorientation debt. Causality holds through motivated discoveries without breaks, and the closure lands on-page with conceptual repricing of the arbor as a living record. Persistent constraint of the tags shapes tactics and charges the final image of the hung sculpture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and shimmering crater are vividly specific, with sensory details like humming air and singing stone filtered through Kaelin's artisan bias, constraining choices like the offering and final dedication. Atmosphere supports the theme of forgotten histories through purposeful tone, and the arbor as a recurring object charges the closure by evolving from relic to living record. Spatial choreography is coherent, with the inner arch discovery providing a tactile payoff. Environment directly shapes the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grafting onto community signals early and deepens through accumulative discoveries under the Textural lens, with one meaningful tightening in realizing the tags as restoration that forces stance crystallization on communal history. Pressure coheres via the tag pattern, narrowing options to the orchard return, with a legible cost in the reweighted ache and foreclosed isolation. Agency drives the shared search and dedication, though coincidence in group formation slightly complicates without resolving. Escalation is protagonist-driven with unmistakable on-page cost, but lacks a second accent for higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of weaving forgotten threads into communal narrative emerges organically from events like tag decoding and the final dedication, with subtext in silences and images avoiding direct statements. Resonance arises from particulars, inviting reflection on belonging without tidy morals, and the ending offers a non-literal answer by repricing the arbor as shared history. Emotional aftereffect is concrete through the infused ache, resisting sentimentality. Minor thematic echo in the explicit "graft oneself onto community" phrasing slightly undercuts subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward artisan details like weaving and forms, and rhythmic control in luminous descriptions heightens pressure without obscurity. Prose texture is distinct in syntax and word choice, like "luminescent ache," with purposeful compression in the accumulative search. Dialogue is minimal but natural, subtextual, and advances plot in Kaelin's final speech. No head-hopping or elision issues, meeting the 9+ test with consistent voice under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere and character through vivid images like "void of captured night," without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in discoveries. Clarity is strong, with strong verbs and specific nouns, though one mixed metaphor in "singing stone" slightly muddles without harming closure. No artifacts touch the final beat, and information propels toward the dedication. Overwriting is minimal, but peak beats could trim minor redundancies for tighter propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise transforms street art tropes into a fresh synthesis of restoration and community in a speculative crater setting, with ingenuity in tags forming a visual language that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the collective artist revelation heightens stakes organically without gimmickry. Details are particular and memorable, avoiding derivatives, though the artisan-seeking-belonging arc echoes familiar motifs without full subversion. Bold commitment to the premise elevates, but lacks one more non-obvious inflection for higher band.</comment>
