<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to capture the geomancer's spark is clear and rooted in her traits as a beautician for the dead, intensifying through the ritual to compel her high-stakes pause in breathing and heartbeat. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with emotions like reverence shown in actions rather than labels, though internal conflict lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final renunciation of her own vitality earns a felt cost, visible in the moment she steps across the threshold of stillness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the single-scene structure builds through patterned imagery and cadence shifts, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the infused emerald reweights the geomancer's essence with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first paragraph, avoiding penalties. Closure lands on-page with felt cost in Elara's halted breath and heart, though the pattern break at infusion feels slightly soft without a sharper before/after reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto under the aurora is vividly specific, with sensory details like humming silence and refracted light filtered through Elara's watchful POV, constraining her ritual choices and charging the final image of the shimmering dirge. Environmental elements evolve causally, mirroring her internal stillness without overt symbolism. This micro-setting directly shapes the closure by providing the celestial dance essential to the geomancer's request.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of capturing the spark before oblivion signals early and deepens through one meaningful tightening in the threshold-crossing, narrowing options under Accumulative/Textural pressure with felt cost in Elara's paused vital signs. Agency manifests in her renunciation, foreclosing her own motion for the infusion. Coherent pressure forces stance crystallization, though stakes remain somewhat abstract without a secondary accent complicating the ritual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of preserving radiant grace amid oblivion emerges organically from images like the emerald's glowing fractures and the aurora's dirge, inviting reflection through purposeful ambiguity without confusion. The final image of the warm chip on the chest offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of death's finality. Subtext in silence and implication enriches emotional honesty, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in Elara's attuned senses and rhythmic prose that modulates with intensity, such as the hush turning electric. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; purposeful compression in the ritual sequence is taught early and pays off at closure. Diction and syntax reflect her lucid watchfulness without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, multi-job sentences like the emerald capturing aurora light, varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold; figurative language is controlled and coherent, enhancing momentum. Clarity shines in the infusion beat, though minor overwriting in descriptive preludes slightly pads without obscuring cause. Final line resolves by recharging the spark motif effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of a skyborne mortician infusing gems with soul-sparks offers fresh synthesis of fantasy and elegy, transforming tropes through specific details like the rune-etched coin and geometric afterimage. Risk-taking in the meditative ritual heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in the joy-spark avoids generics, committing fully to the vision.</comment>
