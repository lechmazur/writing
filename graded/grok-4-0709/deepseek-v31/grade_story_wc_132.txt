<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Aris's motivation to study plants is clear and intensifies toward surrendering control, with embodied reluctance shown in his frown and resolve; interiority is concrete, like the linden leaf as a rebuke, revealing character under pressure. However, internal conflict alternates summaries rather than simultaneous impulses, slightly weakening the emotional layering. The meaningful change—releasing control—forecloses his old methodology with felt cost, evident in his metamorphosis during the storm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure accumulates atmospheric details and observations leading to a resonant reconfiguration in Aris's stance, with closure as Conceptual Repricing where releasing control reweights his premise with undeniable cost in the final sketching scene. Orientation anchors early in the greenhouse post-rain, avoiding penalties. One meaningful deepening occurs via the storm's clarity, sufficient for length, though causality feels more textural than chained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like wet earth and ozone mirroring Aris's transformation; the mossy trellis and storm constrain choices, charging the final image of the linden leaf under glass. Environment evolves causally with the storm, guiding his release of control. Recurring objects like the leaf constrain his realization, meeting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding plant growth tightens through the storm's pressure, deepening via Aris's agency in opening panels, narrowing options with felt cost of abandoning control; under Accumulative/Textural lens, cadence shift reweights stakes effectively. One meaningful intensification suffices, driven by protagonist choice. Coincidence of the leaf complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of surrendering control for true understanding emerges organically from observations and the leaf motif, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in gestures like placing the leaf under glass invites reflection on transformation. Emotional aftereffect is concrete, avoiding sentimentality. Ending offers non-literal answer to control versus witness, meeting 9+ test but with slight overtness in epiphany.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward botanical details, like veined leaf perfection; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, sensory sentences modulating with storm intensity. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets. Elision in reflective blocks anchors in present cues, paying off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "dark bruise against the grey sky"; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops or scaffold, though some metaphors like "circuitously sincere" border on muddle without harming clarity. No artifacts in closure beat; propulsion strong in storm sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh angle on scientific hubris via plant communication and storm surrender synthesizes ideas organically, with the anomalous leaf transforming trope of epiphany; risk in textural accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity feels memorable, though premise echoes familiar transformation arcs slightly.</comment>
