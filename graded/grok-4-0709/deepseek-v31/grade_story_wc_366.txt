<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to protect the letters stems from a consistent practical yet warmly observant trait, intensifying to compel the high-stakes cairn-building choice with embodied emotion like his thudding heart and clutching sea glass. Interior conflict shows contradictory impulses, such as his disbelief in ghosts clashing with instinctive defiance, culminating in an earned renunciation of fear that forecloses isolation with felt cost. The single-POV interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, though the protective instinct surges somewhat abruptly without deeper prior contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under a Causal drive lens, the structure links events through motivated because/therefore causality—from the failing pump trapping Elias to discovering letters, confronting the ghost, and building the cairn—leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the presence recedes with visible cost in his defiant endurance. Orientation anchors who (Elias), where (lantern room), and when (haunted hour) by the first paragraph, serving closure without debt. The single continuous scene fits scope, with one meaningful tightening at the door clang that narrows options effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like the iron grating moan and salt-scent thickening air constraining Elias's choices and charging the final dawn image. Micro-setting elements, such as the gears and jar, integrate into action, mirroring his internal protection urge without overt symbolism. Environment evolves causally, from flickering lamp to dropping temperature, pressuring the climax and supporting tone through selective, POV-biased specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake of protecting the letters/connection escalates causally from discovery to ghostly pressure, with one meaningful tightening at the door clang forcing stance crystallization and a visible cost in Elias's defiant kneel-and-build action. Agency drives the deepening through his tool cairn as a barricade, narrowing options without coincidence resolving it. Moral calculus sharpens the choice between yielding to grief or preserving shared flame, though the recession feels slightly soft without sharper trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of human connection as light against isolation emerges organically from letters, sea glass, and cairn, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights solitude without stated moral. Subtext in gestures like worrying the sea glass and stacking tools invites reflection on bottled safety, earning insight through struggle. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality via complexity, though the ancient grief's ambiguity slightly dilutes counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward practical details like fuel pumps shifting to protective instinct under stress, and rhythmic control accelerating in the confrontation. Brief dialogue ("No... You don't get this light") feels natural, subtextual, and goal-driven, advancing defiance without excess. Elision of Elara's full presence is taught early and paid off in the letters' warmth, maintaining legibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm from the opening flicker to the clang's propulsion, avoiding loops or scaffold except a minor synonym churn in "moan... groan." Figurative language like "sea’s whispers grew teeth" integrates without muddle, supporting momentum in peak beats. Final line recharges motifs cleanly, with strong verbs and specific nouns enhancing clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise transforms haunted lighthouse tropes through the anonymous letter chain and stone-stacking as defiant connection, feeling organic and inevitable via Elias's particular warmth. Risk in blending practical skipper with supernatural confrontation heightens stakes without gimmickry, offering fresh synthesis in the tool cairn as message. Emotional specificity avoids generics, though the ghost's grief echoes familiar archetypes slightly.</comment>
