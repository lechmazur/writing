<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to learn the building's language is clear and intensifies through lessons, culminating in her acceptance of the role with a felt cost of loss; Mr. Valerius's ghostly traits are embodied in his cool skin and nimble movements, creating a crucible that forces her stance crystallization. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like desperation and firmness under pressure. The relationship under pressure alters their state by the end, earning the reconfiguration. Weakness in limited contradictory impulses in scene caps perfection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lessons and seasonal shifts build density to a pattern break at the meteor shower, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Elara inherits the vigil with undeniable conceptual cost as a "gift" that dissolves lies. Causality is motivated through escalating curiosity, with orientation anchored by the first paragraph. Closure lands on-page with the ghost fading and Elara holding the seal, reweighting her role. No orientation debt or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The rooftop garden is vividly specific, evolving from lush to brittle, constraining choices like tea sessions and charging the final image under meteor light; sensory details like damp earth and jasmine are purposeful, filtered through Elara's POV. Atmosphere supports the mysterious tone, with the environment mirroring internal revelations. Recurring garden elements guide action and contrast the city's glow. Micro-setting of the seal as object enhances closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of learning the building's language tightens through thinning lies and seasonal shifts, deepening to a stance crystallization at the confrontation; under Accumulative/Textural lens, cadence shifts with the meteor shower, reweighting options with the cost of inheritance. One meaningful deepening is sufficient, driven by Elara's agency in interrogating. Cost is legible as the ghost's fading and her new burden. No coincidences resolve; pressure coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of understanding hidden languages and promises emerges organically from lessons and the seal's permanence, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer as Elara becomes the scribe; subtext in lies and silences invites reflection on legacies. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through the gift's ambiguity. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing. Coherent without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Elara's building-focused bias; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, image-rich prose modulating with pressure. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, advancing revelations like the custodian confession. No head-hopping or elision issues; diction fits POV. Perceptual control under stress heightens the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel beats; metaphors like "papery rustle" are controlled without muddle. No significant loops or artifacts; sentences advance atmosphere and character. Final line recharges motifs effectively. Minor scaffold in one descriptive run slightly dulls momentum but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost tutor and building language feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific garden evolution and seal's role; risk in ghostly reveal heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in familiarity avoids generics. Commits to premise authentically. Non-obvious angle on inheritance as gift burdens closure ingeniously.</comment>
