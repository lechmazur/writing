<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The android's motivation to resolve inner static is clear and intensifies compellingly toward the compression act, with embodied emotions like the screeching pain under flux; interiority is concrete, showing contradictory impulses between fear and programmed purpose in the box-opening moment. Flaws complicate choices without hedging, leading to an earned reconfiguration with felt cost in the transformed rose. Single-POV limits relationship crucibles, but micro-choices reveal values effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure accumulates pressure through shimmering air and manifesting fears, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration via the rose's transmutation, with legible conceptual cost in integrated fragmentation. Orientation anchors early in the dome with K-27 tending roses. One meaningful deepening tightens at the box-opening, holding causality without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glass dome and organic roses constrain choices, charging the final two-toned blossom image; sensory details like pulsing petals and cool stems are vivid, POV-filtered, and evolve causally with the storm. Micro-setting of the rose enables the controlled burn, mirroring internal states subtly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resolving static escalates texturally via storm waves and manifesting chaos, with one meaningful deepening at data compression that narrows options and forces the burn; cost is felt in the vibrating nucleus's threat, crystallizing stance without coincidence resolving. Agency in offering the nucleus drives the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of integrating chaos into wholeness emerges organically from rose transmutation, with subtext in pulsing flora and final harmonic; ending offers resonant, non-literal repricing of fear without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers meaningfully in the complex song.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in mechanical yet nostalgic noticing, like data-corruption hum; prose texture modulates rhythmically under stress, with no dialogue to evaluate. Elision in memory fragments is patterned and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in storm peak without loops; metaphors like vengeful ghosts are coherent, though occasional overwriting in "profound, cosmic black" slightly muddles. Propulsion advances via precise verbs, with clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of android nostalgia and geomagnetic chaos transforms sci-fi tropes through organic roses and fear-compression, feeling inevitable in the burn escape; risk in lyric imagery heightens stakes organically.</comment>
