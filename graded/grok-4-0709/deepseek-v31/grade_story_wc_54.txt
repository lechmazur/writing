<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to puzzle out hope is clear and rooted in her functionally creative trait, intensifying through choices like picking up the sextant and rerouting power, with embodied emotions in her "stoic wonder" and quiet triumph. Interiority is concrete, showing contradictory impulses in her professional focus versus insubordinate creativity, culminating in an earned transformation that forecloses the site's demolition with felt personal investment. However, some stock phrasing like "mind racing with calculations" slightly dilutes specificity in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure links discoveries through because/therefore progression, from finding the sextant to resurrecting the terminal, with orientation anchored in the first paragraph via the abandoned station and Elara's role. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with Resonant Reconfiguration, the atrium's reveal reweighting the space from tomb to refuge with conceptual cost of redirected purpose evident in the final starlight image. One meaningful tightening suffices, as the power reroute narrows options and forces the triumphant shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is vividly specific with grimy ceramite tiles, ozone scent, and fractured dome, filtering through Elara's engineering bias to constrain choices like aligning the sextant to hidden hatches. Atmosphere of stillness and forgotten things mirrors her hope-seeking, evolving causally as walls slide and starlight pours in, charging the final atrium image under the stars.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resurrecting hope escalates causally through discoveries, with one meaningful tightening as Elara redirects capacitor power, narrowing options and raising the cost of failure in the groaning gears. Agency drives the climax via her jury-rigged connection, foreclosing the site's death with a felt triumph, though stakes remain somewhat abstract without sharper personal risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of finding hope in decay emerges organically from Elara's actions and the maze's transformation, with subtext in the sextant's promise and redirected flows implying renewal's complexity. The final image of starlight through the dome offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration of potential without moralizing, inviting reflection on resurrection's ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-specific, with perceptual signature in Elara's engineering gaze noticing architectural patterns and ozone smells. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, purposeful syntax like "her boots echoing on the grimy ceramite tiles," modulating under pressure without elision or shifts, enhancing immersion in her stoic wonder.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere and action in lines like "the air was still and cold, smelling of ozone and forgotten things," varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold. Figurative language integrates purposefully, as in "tomb of discarded joy," propelling toward closure without muddle, though minor register elevation in "equations for hope" slightly jars in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing an archaic sextant with spaceport hydraulics for a fresh resurrection premise, transforming abandonment tropes through Elara's creative redirection, feeling inevitable in the atrium reveal. Risk-taking in the maze's obfuscation heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
