<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting of ancient terrace at midsummer is vivid and purposeful, with night-blooming vines and celestial dance mirroring internal calm and indifference, constraining choices by providing a serene yet indifferent backdrop that charges the final image of fragile peace. Sensory details are selective, filtered through Elara's bias, evolving causally as delegates arrive on flagstones. The environment subtly guides the ritual's tone, with spatial coherence in her movements from balustrade to bench. Recurring celestial bodies charge the closure, constraining the thematic reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of redemption's price emerges organically from Elara's memories and ritual, resisting tidy morals through ambiguity in the fragile peace, with subtext in the clipboard's swirl and handshake's eon-like hesitation. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting war's ledger via compromise, eliciting emotional aftereffect of hard-won hope without sentimentality. Subtext in gestures like extended hand invites reflection on flawed beauty. No explicit moralizing; complexity embraces counter-readings without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Elara's biased noticing of celestial dance and ebony grain, modulating rhythm from ponderous to steady under pressure. Prose texture distinct in lyrical syntax, purposeful without unmotivated shifts; no dialogue, so policy skips those bullets. Focalization controlled, with inference as inference; elision in memories taught early and paid off in ritual. Narrative stance consistent, prose as character reflecting her operative gentleness.</comment>

Figurative language purposeful, like syrupy time, without muddle or register drift; no artifacts in closure, though some metaphors stack in opening without harming clarity. Strong verbs and specific nouns propel, with clean grammar and sequence clarity. Final line recharges motifs effectively, passing read-aloud test.</comment>
