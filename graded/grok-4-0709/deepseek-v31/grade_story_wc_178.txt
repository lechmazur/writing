<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to seal the covenant is clear and rooted in her frugal, empirical traits, intensifying through failures that reveal internal contradictions in embodied ways, such as frustration unspooling. The meaningful change from quantification to surrender is earned by prior attempts, foreclosing her old path with the felt cost of releasing control, visible in her palm on the tile moment. No second character, so relationship bullets ignored; interiority is concrete without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned failures and a cadence shift to acceptance, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the covenant manifests with conceptual cost of her transformed spirit. Orientation anchors who (Elara), where (ziggurat), and when (liminal hour) by the first sentence, no penalty. Closure lands on-page with felt cost in the entity's appearance and her endless wealth, though one more persistent constraint could elevate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The reimagined ziggurat setting is vivid and purposeful, with stone warmth and glowing schematics constraining Elara's choices and charging the final image of dissolving diagrams. Sensory details like whispering sandals and dusky harmony are selective, POV-filtered, and evolve with action, mirroring her internal shift. Environment pressures her surrender, meeting 9+ test by shaping the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of binding chaos escalates under Accumulative lens through deepening failures that reweight her devotion, forcing stance crystallization in the palm-on-tile surrender with unmistakable cost of her frugal spirit. One meaningful deepening suffices, driven by agency, though coincidence of the entity's response slightly complicates without resolving. Moral calculus between logic and mystery sharpens the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of truths felt not solved emerges organically from Elara's struggles and the magic square's balance, with subtext in silences and glowing failures inviting reflection on mystery. Final image of the inert tile offers a resonant, non-literal answer reweighting her empiricism without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Elara's quantifying bias, modulating rhythm under pressure like frustration unspooling. Prose texture is lyrical yet controlled, with purposeful compression in failures; no dialogue, so ignored. Meets 9+ test with rhythmic control and no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in climbs and hums, advancing atmosphere without loops; e.g., no paraphrase redundancy in failure sequences. Figurative language like "dusky harmony" is purposeful without muddle, though one mixed metaphor ("weight that was empirically ironic") draws minor notice but doesn't obscure closure. Zero artifacts in peak beats meet 9+ test basics, with strong propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astronomy and ancient magic transforms tropes through Elara's empirical irony, feeling inevitable in her surrender; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on devotion, with authentic vision avoiding templates.</comment>
