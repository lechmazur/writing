<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve wonder is clear and rooted in her traits as a bell tuner, intensifying through her precise actions; interiority is concrete and embodied in her sensing frequencies, with micro-choices like cleaning the film revealing values. However, internal conflict lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, trending toward summary rather than layered embodiment in the climax. The final renunciation of a quick fix for re-tuning earns credibility with felt cost of the ice's decay.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure anchors orientation early in the world after the Silencing and Elara's climb, with because/therefore linkages from dissonance detection to adjustment and resolution; closure is a Decisive Change as the note spreads, reconfiguring the valley's harmony with visible cost in the ice's weeping. One meaningful tightening suffices, but ellipsis in her work's immediate effects feels slightly under-motivated before the final note.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bluff setting constrains choices through cold and thin air, charging the final image as prismatic light dances; sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, like vibrations through boots, with the resonator as micro-setting evolving causally to mirror her intent. Environment pressures action, such as the sun catching facets, heightening specificity without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving wonder signals early and tightens causally as the ice's decay narrows options, forcing her dance of precision; agency in adjustment drives escalation with legible cost in the fragment's shrinkage, but coincidence of the sun's role slightly complicates without fully resolving. One deepening suffices, charging the climax effectively under the Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of silence as profound listening emerges organically from events like her kinetic method, resisting tidy morals through the ice's inevitable decay; subtext in gestures and the final note offers resonant ambiguity without confusion. The ending reweights the premise non-literally as the symphony restores wonder, eliciting emotional aftereffect via the blushing valley.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature in her feeling discord through boots; prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, purposeful syntax like "muted vigor," modulating with pressure. No dialogue, so policy applies; elision in her muteness is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere in lines like "the stone biting cold even through her thick gloves"; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops, though one paraphrase near the resonator description slightly redunds without harming clarity. No artifacts touch closure, with strong verbs and specific detail propelling to the pure note.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of muteness and kinetic tuning transforms tropes of silence into organic ingenuity, with the iceberg relic offering non-obvious inflection on wonder's fragility; risk in lyric muted tone heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise feels inevitable, though world-building echoes familiar post-apocalyptic quietude without full subversion.</comment>
