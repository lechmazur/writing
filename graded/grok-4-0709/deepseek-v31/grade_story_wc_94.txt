<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to distill truth from scars is clear and intensifies through her ritual actions, culminating in an earned internal shift from victim to navigator; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in her frozen moment during the blackout. The single-POV focus excels in revealing flaws and micro-choices under pressure, like tracing scratches and handling negatives by touch. No relationships on-page, so those bullets are ignored; the realization forecloses self-pity with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through layered metaphors and sensory patterns, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Elara reweights scars as resistance topography; orientation anchors early in the observatory dome with storm below. Closure lands on-page with the developed poem as a "coordinate," carrying conceptual cost of mourned losses. One meaningful cadence shift during the blackout suffices for length, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is vividly specific, with lightning illuminating panels and thunder shaking foundations, constraining choices like the blackout that heightens tension; it charges the final image by mirroring Elara's internal revelation. Sensory details are purposeful, filtered through her poet's bias, evolving causally with the storm. Environment directly pressures the ritual, qualifying as micro-setting that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding scars tightens through the blackout's coherent pressure, forcing stance crystallization under Situational elements within the Textural lens; one deepening via the timer's click in darkness narrows options, with felt cost in her frozen suspension. Agency in endurance forecloses victimhood. Coincidence of thunder complicates but doesn't resolve, aligning with lens guardrails.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of resistance through mourning emerges organically from images like silenced bells and paved rivers, culminating in a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration of scars as navigable map without moralizing. Subtext in silences and negatives invites reflection on loss. Final image offers earned wisdom from particulars, avoiding platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, sensory noticing like "storm-kissed wonder"; rhythmic control heightens pressure in the blackout without obscurity. No dialogue, so ignored; purposeful compression in ritual description is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in clicks and thunder; metaphors like "cartography of scars" advance atmosphere without muddle, though some figurative stacking in opening risks overwriting but pays off. No loops or artifacts obscure closure; final line resolves by recharging the map motif. Information propulsion strong in ritual beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of censorship via photographic negatives and storm vigil transforms tropes into a fresh angle on resistance; risk in lyric texture heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable at the realization. Premise commits fully, with emotional specificity avoiding generics. Bold non-literal closure elevates ingenuity.</comment>
