<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Aris's motivation to reclaim her son evolves credibly from skepticism to belief, rooted in her historian's eye spotting the tooth mistake, with embodied emotions like gorge rising and calm fissure; interior contradiction shines in her "shrewd innocence" enabling the plan, but occasional label-speak like "cleft in certainty" slightly abstracts the crisis without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure links discovery to garden quest to portal entry via tooth, with motivated ellipsis in her slip away; closure as Charged Poise in holding the tooth for truce reconfigures options with felt cost of Leo's injury, but the Fae's emergence feels slightly coincidental without tighter causal trigger.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The secret garden anchors vividly with mossy tablets, weeping fountain, and ancient oak constraining her plea and enabling the portal; sensory details like humming air and iron-rich water reflect her grief, charging the final image in the mirrored Fae world, though spatial choreography in the maze is briefly vague.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming Leo tightens causally when the tooth pulls her through the portal, forcing immediate healing under pressure; agency in setting the bone crystallizes her stance with visible cost of pain, but coincidence of Fae appearance slightly dilutes escalation without resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of turning mistakes into understanding emerges organically from the mismatched tooth and her alchemical motivation, resonating in the truce bridge without moralizing; subtext in the tooth as compass reweights certainty, but the "nostalgic innovation" tone occasionally states rather than implies complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stays stable in Aris's biased perception, with distinct texture in rhythmic sentences like the garden's hum; dialogue is sparse but natural, as in her steady whisper to Leo, advancing healing; no head-hopping, though brief elision in maze entry is taught and paid off at the oak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in descriptive beats like the waxen effigy softening; some paraphrase loops, such as repeating the tooth's mistake in adjacent lines, slightly drag momentum, but no major artifacts obscure the closure image of holding the tooth.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of changeling lore with a historian mother's bone-setting skill transforms the trope into a truce via mistake, feeling inevitable in her plan to weave constellations; risk in the open-ended poise heightens stakes without gimmickry, though Fae curiosity echoes familiar motifs without full subversion.</comment>
