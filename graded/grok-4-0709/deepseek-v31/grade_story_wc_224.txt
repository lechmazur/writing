<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to understand home is clear and intensifies through her visions' pain, driving tactile choices like using the feather; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses in enduring truths versus seeking solace. Alistair applies secondary pressure effectively as a crucible. The final renunciation of dread is earned with visible cost in ongoing visions, satisfying the 9+ test via causality and cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural, with density building through sensory patterns and a cadence shift at the stone's discovery; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where visions reweight from painful to readable, with felt cost in endurance. Orientation anchors early in the bookstore mountain. The feather's texture as persistent constraint shapes tactics, meeting the 9+ test, though minor ellipsis in the journey slightly softens linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore mountain is vivid and purposeful, with twisting corridors constraining Elara's path and charging the final cavernous room; sensory details like wood grain and stacked books filter through her tactile bias, evolving causally. It meets the 9+ test by constraining choices and charging the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding home tightens via the feather-guided journey under Accumulative/Textural lens, with deepening in the tactile map narrowing options; agency in seeding texture drives escalation, with unmistakable cost in enduring visions. Meets 9+ test through protagonist-driven deepening and legible cost at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of brutal truths as home's foundation emerges organically from visions and stone, with subtext in feather's softness contrasting thunder; final image offers resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing. Meets 9+ test by reweighting prior material through the stone's grammar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in tactile focus, rhythmic prose modulating with pressure; dialogue is natural, subtextual, and goal-driven in Alistair's whisper. No elision issues, meeting 9+ test with control under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and no loops or artifacts; metaphors like "twin pools of shifting, reflective liquid" enhance without muddle, accelerating in the journey beat.
