<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris's motivation shifts credibly from nostalgia to purposeful exploration, rooted in concrete interiority like touching the compass rose, with embodied emotions in his breath catching at the discovery; the final renunciation of past skies for charting the new structure earns a visible cost in accepting eternal exile, satisfying the quick test through contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building through reflective layers to a cadence shift in the discovery, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing closure where exile's cost is reframed as a unique gift; orientation anchors early in the ship's dead state and Aris's isolation, with the time stretch constraint shaping the final image of defiant sketching.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The time dilation observation deck constrains choices by enabling the prolonged perception of the nebula, charging the final image of sketching under the worklight; sensory details like cool glass and echoed silence are selective and POV-filtered, mirroring internal vastness without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure deepens through a single meaningful cadence shift from confusion to exploration, with the dominant stake of survival in isolation reweighted by the discovery's cost of embracing endless solitude; protagonist agency drives the glimpse and mapping decision, making cost unmistakable in the fierce purpose amid exile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of finding direction in exile emerges organically from the compass rose's shifting meaning and the discovery, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final image of sketching the nebula that reweights nostalgia into potential without moralizing; subtext in the glinting applique invites reflection on internal true north.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature in selective noticing of silence and stars, rhythmic control accelerating in the discovery beat; no dialogue or elision issues, and prose texture reflects Aris's stretched temporal state under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in reflective passages and propulsion in the discovery, free of loops or artifacts; metaphors like time as "sluggish sea" and "taffy" are coherent and purposeful, with the final line's soft scratch defiant against silence charging closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise of temporal stretch enabling hidden cosmic discovery offers a fresh synthesis of sci-fi isolation and family tradition, with risk in lyric introspection heightening stakes organically; the compass rose transforms a naval relic into a symbol of internal navigation, feeling inevitable without trope echoes.</comment>
