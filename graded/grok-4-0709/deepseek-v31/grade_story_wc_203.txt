<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo's motivation as a ghost-seeing technician driven to uncover hidden truths is clear and intensifies compellingly toward his choice to engage, with embodied interiority showing contradictory impulses not to interact yet compelled by the itch; the final renunciation of his no-engagement rule carries visible emotional cost in his rough voice and the girl's relief. Strengths include character-specific perceptions like analyzing dust as a timeline, avoiding stock phrasing. Minor slip in ghost girl's one-note heroism, but it doesn't touch closure motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inferred Causal lens holds with strong because/therefore linkages: the ghost's point leads to moving the desk and finding the barrel, triggering the vision and Leo's engagement for closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt conceptual cost in revealing her heroism. Orientation anchors who (Leo), where (abandoned circus ticket office), and when (post-fluorescent buzz) by ~50 words. Persistent constraint of his vocation shapes tactics, elevating the score; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory details like rotting wood, popcorn ghost, and dust motes as confetti anchor the abandoned circus ticket office, with the ceiling's fissures constraining Leo's discovery and charging the final image of dissolving dust-motes. Micro-setting of the counter and desk integrates into action, reflecting POV bias. Environment evolves causally with the panel opening and dust shower, mirroring internal revelation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering ceilings' secrets tightens meaningfully when the vision reveals the girl's heroism, forcing Leo's agency in engaging despite his rule, with felt emotional cost in breaking his burden and her fading relief under Causal lens. One deepening narrows options, crystallizing his stance without coincidence resolving. Moral calculus between non-engagement and witnessing heroism sharpens the peak choice effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of hidden heroism and burdens emerges organically from the barrel's discovery and vision, with subtext in cracks mirroring fractured stories, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect of relief avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars like the girl's solid smile. Coherent without tidy binaries, inviting reflection on unseen courage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-specific, with perceptual signature in Leo's technical observations like sheave wheels filtering details; brief dialogue ("I see you") pursues goal with subtext of relief, natural and advancing closure. Rhythmic control heightens pressure in the vision without elision issues. Distinct texture in syntax and word choice, like "weightless burden," coheres without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in lines like dust as "geological record" advance atmosphere and character without loops or scaffold; varied rhythm and syntax support momentum, with clean grammar and no artifacts in closure. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the vision. Minor synonym pair ("sweet-and-sour ghost") doesn't obscure, but overall clarity elevates.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-seeing technician in abandoned circus uncovering clockwork heroism feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like the mainspring barrel and dust analysis; risk in engaging ghosts heightens stakes organically. Avoids stock echoes, committing to premise with authentic vision. Minor familiarity in ghost-fading, but non-obvious angle on hidden burdens stands out.</comment>
