<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to innovate with the seed is clear and rooted in curiosity, driving her design choices effectively, but interiority relies on poetic whispers rather than embodied contradictions or stress-degraded thoughts. The final triumph feels earned through her actions, yet lacks a visible cost or internal conflict at peak moments, such as when placing the seed under the skylight. No second character appears on-page to apply relationship crucibles, fitting the single-POV scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural, with density building through atmospheric patterns like silence and flow toward the bloom's reconfiguration. Orientation anchors early in the rain-swept shed beside the brook, and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing where the bloom reweights innovation's premise with undeniable wonder, though conceptual cost feels oblique without a sharper felt price. One meaningful cadence shift from design to eruption suffices for length, holding without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like amber glow, earth scent, and brook melody integrate into action, with the skylight and vents constraining the seed's growth and charging the final bloom image. Atmosphere supports the innovative theme through storm-born hush, evolving causally with events. Selective focus reflects Mara's priorities without tourist catalogs, though occupational depth is minimal but apt for scope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of innovating a living puzzle signals early and deepens via design and participant solving, but escalation feels textural rather than tightening options with visible cost under the Accumulative lens. The bloom's eruption crystallizes stance without a clear trade-off or foreclosed path, relying on awe over pressure. Coincidence of the mailed seed complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of innovation through flowing ideas emerges organically from the seed's receptivity and bloom, with subtext in whispers and scents inviting reflection on mystery without direct statements. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting the premise via the constellation-like petals. Ambiguity lingers meaningfully, avoiding tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and biased through Mara's perceptual signature, with rhythmic prose modulating like the brook's melody under emotional intensity. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; patterned diction teaches lyric compression early, paying off at closure without obscurity. Distinct texture in syntax and word choice heightens atmosphere consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose density is high with purposeful rhythm, as in "rain fell in sheets, muffling the town," advancing atmosphere and momentum, but occasional paraphrase loops like repeated "storm-born silence" dull propulsion without taught pattern payoff. Figurative language stacks in peak beats without muddle, though some overwriting in the bloom description borders on purple. Clarity holds at closure, with varied syntax supporting emphasis.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of escape room with a mood-receptive corpse flower transforms tropes through specific design like orthogonal vents, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, though premise echoes familiar mystery-box narratives without bolder subversion.</comment>
