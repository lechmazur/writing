<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as an underestimated rebel is clear and intensifies through resourceful actions like mapping with shadows, compelling her to broadcast truth; interiority is concrete via her quiet smile masking resolve, but emotions lean toward abstract labels without strong contradictory impulses in scene. The final endurance forecloses indifference with conceptual cost, yet lacks embodied contradiction under peak pressure, as in the transmission moment where resolve feels tidy rather than conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through patterned imagery like puddle reflections leading to the transmitter, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where histories are revised with undeniable social cost; orientation anchors early with the night-veiled lagoon. Closure lands on-page via the broadcast rippling freedom, reweighting stakes, but lacks a sharper pattern break at the end for stronger cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The auric lagoon under starlight is vivid and purposeful, with ripples catching starlight mirroring Mara's resolve and constraining her path to the platform; sensory details like molten gold glow integrate into action, charging the final image where the water becomes a living chart. The setting evolves causally, pressuring choices like following reflected lines, and its micro-elements (puddles, waves) constrain the climax without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of broadcasting truth against indifference tightens meaningfully when Mara inserts the key, deepening via the transmission's ripple that reweights options for rebels; under Accumulative/Textural lens, density increases through imagery, but cost remains mostly conceptual without a visceral on-page trade-off. Agency via her whisper crystallizes stance, yet escalation feels static in places, lacking a secondary pressure to force sharper crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of revised histories emerges organically from particulars like the liquid memory map and broadcast inserting defiance, inviting reflection on indifference without tidy morals; subtext in images like phantom fireflies elicits emotional aftereffect. The final image of the lagoon whispering approval offers a resonant, non-literal answer to coded freedom, reweighting the premise with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature in poetic noticing of glints and ripples, modulating rhythm under pressure like the humming transmitter; prose texture is distinct with purposeful compression in lyric mode. Patterned elision in reflections is taught early and pays off at closure, but some dense diction borders on register drift, slightly obscuring subtext in the whisper moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety in opening veil imagery, but overwriting with stacked metaphors like "silver veil over auric lagoon" and "scattered coins" creates density muddle in peak beats, triggering -0.6 for figurative overload without payoff. Paraphrase loops appear in retelling history revisions, dulling momentum; information density is high but propulsion slows in reflective blocks exceeding BRR allowance without tilting present stance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing rebellion with poetic elements like puddle-map navigation and coded ripples, transforming trope of hidden transmitter through specific, non-obvious imagery; emotional truth in quiet defiance feels authentic. The premise offers fresh angle on tyranny via liquid memory, with risk-taking in lyric structure heightening stakes without gimmickry, though some metaphors echo familiar nature-symbolism without full personalization.</comment>
