<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to reclaim deleted memories is clear and rooted in her lantern-lighter traits, intensifying through embodied actions like reading coffee grounds and exhuming sand, with internal conflict shown in her haunted question and bone-deep tugs. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, as seen in her steady breath amid fluctuating gravity. However, emotions lean performative rather than deeply contradictory, with flaws not complicating choices enough at the climax, slightly softening the earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images like spirals and salt crystals, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where memories are reclaimed with conceptual cost in the whale's echoed song and steadied gravity. Orientation anchors early with Mara at the dock and beached whale, serving the resonant ending. Causality holds via motif accumulation, but some ellipsis, like the sudden filament emergence, feels lightly unmotivated without stronger linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber is vividly specific, with fluctuating gravity constraining Mara's movements and charging the final image of steadied walls and returning tide. Sensory details like salt's kiss and crystal hum are purposeful, filtered through her POV, mirroring internal reclamation. Environment evolves causally, from withdrawn sea to humming walls, guiding choices without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding deleted memories tightens through one meaningful deepening when coffee grounds form a spiral, triggering the chamber's tremble and exhumation, narrowing options under gravity's pulse. Pressure coheres texturally, with cost felt in the whale's loss and reclaimed fragments' weight, but escalation remains somewhat static without a sharper reversal or trade-off. Coincidence in the matching symbol complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming deleted memories emerges organically from images like pressed flowers and gravity pockets, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer that memories wait to be lifted, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext in silence and whispers invites reflection on loss, with emotional honesty avoiding sentimentality. However, some ambiguity feels purposeful but borders on oblique, slightly diluting thematic complexity at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Mara's selective noticing of flames, scents, and pulses, modulating rhythmically under pressure without head-hopping. Prose texture is distinct in lyrical syntax and patterned diction, teaching compression early and paying off at the gleaming silence. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision in memory emergence is legible under textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "sifted dreams" and varying rhythm without loops, though some figurative stacking in the chamber scene borders on muddle without harming clarity. Clarity holds with clean grammar and propulsion, but occasional synonym churn, like "gleaming silence" repetitions, slightly drags momentum at the end. Opening anchors voice strongly, and final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of whale's loss with gravity pockets and coffee divination transforms familiar loss tropes through specific, organic details like the filament coiling memories. Risk in lyric structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight. However, core premise echoes mythic reclamation tales without fully bold subversion.</comment>
