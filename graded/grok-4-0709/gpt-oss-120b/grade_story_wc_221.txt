<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to turn confusion into exploration is clear and rooted in family ritual, intensifying through the sketching act to compel a resolve with felt cost of loss. Interiority is concrete via embodied actions like pressing charcoal to glass, revealing contradictory impulses in grief and hope without stock phrasing. However, emotions occasionally lean toward abstract summary, as in "confusion melt into a quiet resolve," slightly diluting embodiment under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned reflections and images like the compass and sketching, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where resolve reweights stakes with conceptual cost of navigating a blank map. Orientation anchors early with the deck and shutdown context by ~100 words. Closure lands on-page with the promise and shifted true north, though one ellipsis in the vision feels mildly unmotivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The time dilation observation deck is vividly specific, with sensory details like humming quantum echo and rippling air constraining choices and charging the final glowing walls. It evolves causally, mirroring internal states through temporal stretching that enables the vision. A recurring object like the compass integrates with setting to charge closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding direction post-shutdown tightens accumulatively through the vision and sketching, deepening knowledge with one meaningful cadence shift to resolve, foreclosing confusion at felt cost. Pressure coheres under textural lens but remains somewhat abstract, with no sharp reversal testing commitment. Coincidence of the line aligning complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of honoring loss through exploration emerges organically from sketching ritual and compass motifs, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the fractured reality. Subtext in silence and rippling air invites reflection, culminating in a resonant final image of pulsing map without stated moral. However, occasional direct statements like "every stretched moment held a compass" border on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, reflective texture, modulating rhythm under pressure like stretched minutes. Patterned elision in visions is taught early and pays off at closure without obscurity. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; prose rhythm reflects focalizer's mind effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in metaphors like "minutes stretched like taffy" that advance atmosphere without loops. Some overwriting in peak beats, such as stacked figuratives in the vision, triggers minor deduction, but clarity holds at closure. No major artifacts obscure cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of time dilation with family ritual transforms sci-fi tropes through specific emotional truth, feeling inevitable in the pulsing compass at closure. Risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Avoids derivative premises by grounding in personal navigation.</comment>
