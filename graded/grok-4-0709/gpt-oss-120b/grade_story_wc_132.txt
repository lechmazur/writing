<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marlowe's motivation to study plant behaviors is clear and intensifies through subtle actions like placing the copper coil, revealing interior contradictions in his desire to intervene yet release control. Interiority is concrete, with embodied curiosity in his steady heart and gratitude toward the storm, though emotional progression lacks deeper contradictory impulses under stress. The final renunciation of direct control feels earned with visible cost in patience, foreclosing forceful methods.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increasing through layered observations, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the leaf's transformation reweights the premise of control with conceptual cost in humility. Orientation anchors who (Marlowe), where (nursery trellis), and when (post-rain during storm season) by ~50 words, waiving any penalty. Closure lands on-page with the leaf's verdant shift and Marlowe's promise, but lacks a sharper persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mossy trellis after rain is vividly specific, with droplets as prisms and wind as equations, filtering through Marlowe's scientific bias to constrain choices like coil placement. Sensory details evolve causally with the storm, mirroring internal patience without overt symbolism. Environment charges the final image of the greenhouse and saplings, elevating resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake in understanding reluctant metamorphosis tightens once through the mycelium bridge, deepening knowledge via subtle intervention, but pressure remains low without a clear reversal or forced trade-off. Agency in releasing control forecloses direct forcing with felt cost in patience, fitting the textural lens. Coincidence of natural forces complicates but does not resolve, though stakes feel abstract rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of transformation through releasing control emerges organically from the leaf's unfurling and Marlowe's insight, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in nature's agency. Subtext in the coil as conduit implies gentle influence, inviting reflection on humility without confusion. The final image of the greenhouse offers a resonant, non-literal answer reweighting the premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV maintains perceptual signature through Marlowe's curious, biased noticing of ozone and mycelium, with rhythmic prose modulating via storm cadence. No dialogue or head-hopping; purposeful compression in reflective blocks anchors to present cues like the quivering leaf. Elision of direct action pays off in the ending reconfiguration without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose has high density with vivid images like refracted droplets, but paraphrase loops around "reluctant metamorphosis" and "releasing control" in adjacent sentences dull momentum without payoff (−0.6). Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the transformation beat, though some template cadence in observational stems repeats. No major artifacts touch closure, preserving propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical observation with philosophical release transforms familiar nature metaphors through specific copper coil and mycelium details, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk in quiet, accumulative structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry (+0.3). Avoids stock tropes by grounding in Marlowe's singular humility.</comment>
