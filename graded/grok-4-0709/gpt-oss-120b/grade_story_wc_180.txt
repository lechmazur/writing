<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to bridge generational wisdom is clear and intensifies through her persistence in mending, rooted in traits like feistiness that compel choices like using bag contents; however, interiority leans on abstract labels like "old fire of her lineage" without strong embodied contradictions under pressure. Mira's presence applies secondary pressure effectively, forcing Lira to explain and demonstrate patience, altering their relationship subtly by the end. The final endurance feels earned with a felt cost of the breach, but emotions are more performed than contradictory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of leaves, vows, and light, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final chime and sharpened vision that reweights the breach as purposeful; orientation anchors early in the orchard-cathedral, but causality is loose with reflective blocks exceeding BRR allowance without always tilting present stance. Closure lands with conceptual cost of accidental wisdom, visible in the pact and renewal. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lush orchard in cathedral rafters is vividly specific, with sensory details like filtered gold and whispering leaves mirroring Lira's internal renewal; setting constrains choices, as vines snag the ribbon prompting mending, and charges the final image of footsteps as a hymn. Details evolve causally, like storm clouds bruising the sky, affecting atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of bridging wisdom tightens through the ribbon-snag incident, deepening pressure via the thorn's chaos and mending act that narrows options toward quartz repair; under Textural lens, cadence shifts reweight the stake with cost of the breach, but escalation feels static without a stronger reversal forcing stance crystallization. Agency in persistence forecloses prior guild reliance with felt cost in the realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of renewal through broken promises emerges organically from motifs like deciduous vows and mending, culminating in a resonant final image of leaves whispering a pact without moralizing; subtext in gestures like loosening the thorn invites reflection on care versus chaos. However, insights border on platitudes like "every fracture holds a seed of renewal," slightly undercutting complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual bias toward orchard's pulse, modulating rhythm in lyric compression like "deciduous vows" that teaches patterned elision; dialogue is natural, subtextual in Mira's question advancing theme, but brief. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic metaphors, holding under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and density in images like "light fell like a choir," advancing atmosphere, but paraphrase loops appear in repetitive vows and renewal motifs, dulling momentum; figurative language stacks in peak beats like the mending without payoff, triggering −0.6. Clarity holds with clean grammar, but some overwriting muddles propulsion in reflective blocks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise of mending quartz eyes in a cathedral orchard offers fresh synthesis of fantasy and renewal, transforming trope of broken promises through specific generational motifs; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, but echoes familiar wisdom tales without bold non-obvious inflection.</comment>
