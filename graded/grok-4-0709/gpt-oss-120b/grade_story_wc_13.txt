<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to find the echo source is clear and rooted in her illustrator traits, intensifying through actions like sketching ripples to anchor the present; however, interiority relies on abstract phrasing like "warm against her skin" without embodied contradictions under pressure. The final renunciation of the pendant earns stasis by foreclosing linear time, with felt conceptual cost. Strengths include micro-choices revealing values, but emotions lack irrational layering, trending toward tidy epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned echoes and cadence shifts, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where Mira becomes the echo, reweighting time with undeniable conceptual cost in the pendant's release. Orientation anchors early with the city and canal, no disorientation debt. One meaningful deepening suffices, with the luminous ribbon as a pattern break advancing knowledge; minor redundancy in ripple descriptions doesn't break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The rooftop canal system is vividly specific, weaving light and shadows to mirror Mira's quest, constraining choices like gliding the skiff and descending the spiral; sensory details like fractured light on ripples are purposeful and POV-filtered. Environment charges the final image as the water turns silver, restoring rhythm. Micro-setting of the pendant and canal integrates action without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding the echo source tightens through the pendant's glow and bridge of light, deepening via the cavern discovery under Accumulative/Textural lens, with one cadence shift reweighting time's cost. Agency in releasing the pendant crystallizes stance with felt price, but stakes occasionally feel abstract rather than visceral. Coincidence of the gondolier's rumor complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of sculpting time emerges organically from images like the infinity loops and echoes, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer where Mira becomes part of the city's song, embracing complexity without moralizing. Subtext in whispers and rhythms invites reflection on possibility. Final image reweights the premise with ambiguity, avoiding tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in artistic noticing like light on ripples, but diction drifts into elevated register like "uncage moments" not fully POV-bound. Prose texture is distinct and rhythmic, modulating with pressure; no dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets. Patterned elision in mythic elements is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purposeful metaphors like "lattice of stone ribs," advancing atmosphere, but paraphrase loops appear in ripple and cadence descriptions, dulling momentum without payoff. Rhythm varies naturally, yet figurative overload in the cavern beat mixes vehicles slightly, triggering minor artifact penalty. Information density is high, with sentences multitasking, but peak beats have some scaffold in repetitive stems like "she [action]." Final line resolves resonantly without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The mythic canal quest synthesizes familiar fantasy with fresh inflection in time as sculptable echoes, feeling inevitable through the pendant's evolution; risk in lyric abstraction heightens stakes without gimmickry. Premise transforms tropes like sleeping giants via specific illustrator lens, avoiding stock echoes. Emotional specificity in becoming the echo adds ingenuity.</comment>
