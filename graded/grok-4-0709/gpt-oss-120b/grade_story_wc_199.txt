<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to decode leaves is clear and rooted in traits like orderliness, intensifying through actions like building monuments, but interiority leans abstract with stock poetic phrasing like "mossy delight" lacking embodied contradiction. The transformation earns a meaningful change with felt cost in her reordered soul, shown in the climax where she deciphers "home." Strengths include consistent flaws complicating choices, but emotions feel performed rather than contradictory under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, patterns of leaves and monuments build density to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure with conceptual cost in Lira's rebirth, as the final mist seals the pact. Orientation anchors early with Lira in the arbor; one meaningful cadence shift occurs when the leaf ignites, reweighting knowledge. Strength is coherent motif accumulation without causality breaks, though minor ellipsis in the spring discovery feels unmotivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is vividly specific with sensory details like rustling leaves mirroring POV bias, constraining choices like prodding moss to reveal the pool, which charges the final cascade image. Atmosphere supports the hush of past and prophecy, evolving causally with events. Micro-setting of monuments and vial integrates into action, though some details repeat statically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding leaves signals early, with one meaningful deepening when the ignited leaf surges through her veins, narrowing options and forcing transformation with felt cost. Under Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through motif density, but stakes remain somewhat abstract without visceral trade-offs. The climax's deciphering tests commitment, yet resolution feels more accumulative than agency-driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of human-forest connection and renewal emerges organically from images like falling leaves as ciphers, culminating in a resonant final image of dissolving leaf without stated moral. Subtext in monuments as pleas adds complexity, inviting reflection on forgotten wisdom. Strength is emotional aftereffect through particulars, avoiding sentimentality, though some ambiguity borders on vagueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct lyrical texture in syntax and rhythm, like patterned elision in leaf scripts, taught early and paid off at closure. Perceptual signature filters through Lira's orderly bias, with no dialogue to evaluate. Narrative stance modulates effectively under transformation pressure, though minor register drift into elevated diction occurs in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose has high density with vivid images like "leaves that fell like ancient verses," but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "monuments" descriptions) and template cadence in action sequences dull momentum, especially in the spring revelation. Rhythm varies, yet overwriting with stacked metaphors in the climax obscures clarity without payoff. Strengths include concise advancement, but artifacts touch closure, triggering -0.6 deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folklore decoding with seed-sorting and monuments transforms nature-communication trope through specific details like moonstone dust igniting leaves, feeling inevitable at the pact-sealing end. Risk in lyrical structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. However, premise echoes familiar eco-fantasy without bold subversion.</comment>
