<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to map wall dreams is clear and rooted in her lineage, intensifying through her interactions with the diaries and negative, leading to an earned acceptance of the legacy's burden. Interiority is concrete via embodied perceptions like hearing hums and feeling ash, with contradictory impulses shown in her initial burden versus final communion. However, emotions lean toward poetic abstraction rather than raw contradiction under stress, slightly softening peak moments. The final stroke on the map reveals her value hierarchy with a felt cost of shared responsibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered discoveries from diaries to negative to hum, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the legacy transforms from burden to communion with conceptual cost of honoring silent reveries. Orientation anchors who (Lira), where (ivy-veiled passage), and when (after climate shifts) early, with no disorientation debt. One meaningful deepening suffices, as the negative's use tightens her understanding, though causality is more poetic than strict linkage. The ending's resonant reconfiguration lands on-page with the final map stroke and dream hum as undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage is vividly anchored with mist, rain, cracked stone, and hearth, evolving causally as Lira interacts with it, mirroring her internal shift from burden to communion. Sensory details like the hum resonating with thunder and scent of rain are selective and POV-biased, constraining her choices by revealing dreams. The post-climate shift world subtly pressures her motivation through perpetual mist, charging the final image of swirling ivy. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, with the negative pressed against stone as a pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering wall dreams signals early and deepens once through the negative's translation of visuals to echoes, reweighting options under the Accumulative lens with conceptual cost of transformed legacy. Pressure coheres via accumulating resonances, forcing stance crystallization in accepting shared responsibility, though coincidence in finding diaries complicates without resolving. One tightening suffices, but stakes remain somewhat abstract, lacking visceral trade-offs. The hum's exhale narrows her path, foreclosing isolation with felt communal price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of legacies as shared living histories emerges organically from Lira's mappings and wall interactions, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in dreams changing seasons. Subtext in gestures like pressing the negative to stone invites reflection on collective imagination without confusion. The final image of the map as a symphony offers a resonant, non-literal answer to honoring silent stories. However, occasional abstract statements like "walls, like people, carry stories" border on direct theme echo, slightly diluting emergence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable and close, with perceptual signature in Lira's sensitive hearing of echoes and biased noticing of resonances, modulating rhythm under emotional intensity like the heartbeat hum. Prose texture is distinct with poetic syntax and rhythm, teaching patterned elision in dream descriptions that pays off at closure. No dialogue present, so no evaluation there; free indirect style is clean without filter stacks. Tense is consistent, and purposeful compression in the months-following shard serves the accumulative lens without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the corridor's hum resonating with thunder, advancing atmosphere without loops. Some paraphrase redundancy appears in repeated dream descriptions, like sighs trapped in stone, slightly dulling momentum but not touching closure. Figurative language is controlled, with metaphors like green-threaded artery coherent and voice-motivated. Final line recharges motifs effectively, though minor template cadence in listing discoveries reduces propulsion in the middle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise of echo cartography mapping wall dreams offers a fresh synthesis of sensory translation and legacy, feeling inevitable through Lira's lineage and climate-shifted world. Tropes of forgotten knowledge are transformed via specific details like the ash-marred negative, heightening stakes without gimmickry. Risk in poetic structure elevates coherence, as the accumulative build commits to its implications. The hum as a lullaby composed of breaths provides a non-obvious inflection that recharges the concept.</comment>
