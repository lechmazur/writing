<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to map river origins is clear and rooted in her atlas editor traits, intensifying through subtle confidence that compels her to transmit the message; interiority is concrete via trembling fingertip and embodied dread, but contradictory impulses are summarized rather than simultaneous in scene, slightly weakening peak choices like stepping outside.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, patterns of condensation and ice build density to a Charged Poise closure where the cracking ice reconfigures convergence with felt dread-cost; orientation anchors early in the outpost by the lake; one meaningful cadence shift at the signal burst suffices, though causality feels elliptical without stronger linkage to the falcon's return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The rusted outpost and frozen lake vividly anchor atmosphere, with sensory details like crunching ice and iron-tasting air mirroring Mara's tranquility-dread; the setting constrains her choices by hiding subterranean streams and charges the final image of the glinting water vein, though occupational map details could integrate more purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding rivers' beginnings tightens through the condensation pattern's revelation, deepening knowledge with a single intensification that reweights options under the Textural lens; agency via transmission forecloses isolation with dread-cost, but pressure remains abstract without a sharper on-page reversal narrowing paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of convergence from ice and silence emerges organically through images like wet letters and cracking ice, offering resonant ambiguity in the final smiling dread without moralizing; subtext in the phrasebook's glyph invites reflection on myth-geography, though epiphanies like "every river is born from ice" border on direct statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual bias toward maps and condensation, modulating rhythm poetically under pressure; prose texture is distinct in patterned diction like "dog-ear curled like a tired ear," teaching lyric compression early and paying off at closure without elision issues; no dialogue present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid images like "metal ribs shivering," varying rhythm purposefully, but occasional paraphrase loops (e.g., tranquility-dread restated) and mixed metaphors (e.g., spine cracking like a gun) slightly dull momentum in the transmission beat without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography, linguistics, and thawing ice transforms familiar exploration tropes through Mara's specific worldview, with the condensation method offering non-obvious ingenuity that heightens thematic stakes; risk in lyric structure coheres without gimmickry, though premise echoes poetic nature-myth without bolder subversion.</comment>
