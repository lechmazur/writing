<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear through Mara's quest to embrace chance post-mother's death, but it's rooted in labels like "compulsive gambler by inheritance" without embodied contradictions or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority relies on abstract summaries rather than simultaneous impulses, as in her theoretical rebelliousness whispered by colleagues without on-page enactment. The final theorem-writing feels unearned, lacking a visible cost beyond the lingering melancholy. No second character, so relationship bullets are ignored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure follows because/therefore links like placing the coin leading to the panel opening, but sequencing feels outline-like with redundant symbolic steps. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing via the new theorem embracing certainty and chance, with conceptual cost from the mother's heart attack felt in the lingering melancholy. Orientation anchors early in the rainwashed library at midsummer, avoiding penalties. One meaningful tightening occurs in the tunnel traversal, sufficient for length, though ellipsis lacks motivated pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting anchors vividly in the rainwashed library with filtered light and old paper smells, evolving to subway tunnels with phosphorescent symbols that guide choices. Sensory details like the flickering lantern and distant thunder are purposeful, mirroring internal chaos, but some repetition (e.g., clover melancholy) feels static. The environment constrains actions, as tunnel signage directs Mara, charging the final ledger scene. No occupational depth required, as it fits the quest.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Under Causal lens, dominant stake of widening perspectives is signaled early but remains abstract, with one tightening in the tunnel interpretation narrowing options conceptually but without visceral cost. Pressure from mother's heart attack complicates but doesn't force stance crystallization; no meaningful reversal or deepening raises stakes. Agency is passive endurance, foreclosing little with faint emotional price in the sputtering flame. Coincidence in panel opening resolves without protagonist-driven escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of lucid contradictions emerges from events like interpreting the equation, but it's directly stated rather than implicit, with the final theorem offering a literal answer. Subtext in lantern shadows and scrawls invites reflection, but epiphanies feel unearned, as in the sudden insight without struggle. Resonance avoids sentimentality yet resolves tidily, embracing complexity without lingering ambiguity. No motif checklist applied; recurring lantern reweights minimally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual bias in Mara's probability-filtered notices, like tracing the 7:11 ratio. Prose texture is distinct in poetic rhythm, but syntax monotony and register drift into academic diction (e.g., "lucid contradictions") jar. No dialogue, so those bullets ignored; elision in tunnel shift is taught but pays off weakly at closure. Psychic distance serves beats, but emotional ventriloquism asserts insights without inference modesty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense with metaphors like "veins of possibility," but overwriting muddles clarity, as in mixed prism-shadow imagery without payoff. Paraphrase loops, such as repeating "clover melancholy," and template cadence in quest steps trigger -0.6; artifacts touch closure by dulling the theorem-writing. Rhythm varies, but redundancies slow momentum, with final line resolving weakly via image. Information density is high yet padded with synonyms, harming propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Premise of a gambler's daughter questing in a symbolic subway offers a fresh angle on probability paradoxes, but it echoes familiar trope transformations without bold risk. Details like cryptic scrawls feel organic, yet the synthesis is obvious, with the theorem turn inevitable but not ingenious. Emotional complexity is present but generic; no proximity to famous scenes, but lacks singular stance. Risk in lyric motifs heightens minimally without gimmickry.</comment>
