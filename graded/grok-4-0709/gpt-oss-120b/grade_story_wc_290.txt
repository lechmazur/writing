<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The explorer's claustrophobia and prudently adventurous nature create contradictory impulses that drive micro-choices, like stepping into the narrowing corridor despite protests, but interiority often relies on abstract labels like "paradox" without deeper embodiment under stress. Emotions are somewhat embodied in breath tightening, yet the final realization feels slightly unearned due to poetic summary rather than dramatized contradiction. Strengths lie in flaws complicating choices, as seen when claustrophobia whispers during the passage reveal, foreclosing easy retreat with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and cadence shifts, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the key reweights forgetting stories with conceptual cost, evident in the explorer's vow to share. Orientation anchors early with the cavern under starlight, avoiding penalties. Closure lands on-page with the dawn emergence and mutiny in heart, but some ellipsis in spatial changes feels unmotivated, slightly weakening linkage to the organ's reverberation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cavern as shadowed nexus vividly anchors atmosphere with sensory details like quivering walls and organ tones, selectively filtered through the explorer's bias, and the garden's luminescent fungi charges the final image by mirroring resonance. Setting constrains choices, as narrowed corridors heighten claustrophobia, but some details like the constellated window feel ornamental without evolving causally. Strengths in purposeful integration, where environment mirrors internal rebellion without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure accumulates through density of imagery and pattern breaks like the walls' sigh, tightening to force stance crystallization at the key's lift, with felt cost in overcome claustrophobia. Dominant stake of uncovering the key deepens once meaningfully via the compass activation, but escalation remains somewhat static without a sharper reversal. The moral calculus between fear and resolve sharpens the peak, yet coincidence in the passage unfolding complicates without fully resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of rebellion against forgetting emerges organically from images like spatial mutiny and organ resonance, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like clutching the compass implies deeper freedom, but some direct statements like "the rebellion he had sparked was not against stone" border on thematic echo. Emotional aftereffect lingers through wistful tone, avoiding sentimentality via complexity in claustrophobic doubts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable with perceptual signature in biased noticing of closing walls and glowing lines, and rhythmic prose modulates with pressure, as in trembling air sentences. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; purposeful compression in lyric mode teaches patterns early, paying off at closure. Minor register drift into elevated diction like "transfix the void" feels slightly unmotivated for the explorer's voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose features high density with vivid images like "blossoming map," but paraphrase loops appear in repeated rebellion motifs, and template cadence in "He [action]" runs dull momentum slightly. Figurative language muddles in mixed metaphors like walls as wound and architecture rebelling, triggering -0.6; strengths in propulsion during the passage unfold, but artifacts touch closure with redundant "sigh" echoes. No major grammar issues, but overwriting in peak beats reduces clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise of a compass igniting spatial mutiny offers fresh synthesis of exploration and metaphor, transformed through specific details like organ reverberation, feeling inevitable at the garden reveal. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, but echoes familiar fantasy tropes like hidden passages without full personalization. Strengths in authentic vision cohering voice and theme, avoiding middle-ground hedging.</comment>
