<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to dissolve perception boundaries is clear but remains abstract, rooted in poetic traits rather than embodied contradictions; interiority uses stock epiphanic phrasing like "felt the texture of time under her fingertips" without simultaneous impulses in scene. The child's brief appearance adds no relational pressure, and Mara's flaws feel ornamental, not complicating choices with visible cost. Earned stasis at the end lacks a foreclosed path with dramatized trade-off, trending functional but limited.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds density through layered motifs like vines and photographs, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the maze reveals time's texture with conceptual cost in loss and renewal, as in the final glowing garden image. Orientation anchors early with the garden and Mara, but causality is elliptical without motivated ellipsis changing options distinctly. One meaningful cadence shift suffices, yet the ending feels more declarative than reweighted with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is vividly specific, with sensory details like humming vines and ambient mist integrated into action, subtly mirroring Mara's internal dissolution quest; it constrains choices by pulsing in response to wanderers, charging the final blooming arch image. Micro-setting of the bridge and hedges evolves causally, affecting the maze's loops without static repetition. Tone tensions the reverie with quaking, supporting theme organically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of dissolving memory-moment boundaries signals early but escalates via textural density rather than narrowing options; one deepening occurs as photographs disintegrate, reweighting the stake with subtle loss cost, yet pressure feels coherent but not intensifying to force stance crystallization under the lens. No clear reversal or trade-off, with agency in endurance lacking visceral test. Coincidence in the child's pause complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of time's fluidity emerges organically from motifs like disintegrating photographs and hyperbolic corridors, culminating in a resonant final image of the glowing garden without stated moral, inviting reflection on loss and renewal. Subtext in vaporous threads stitching past to present enriches complexity, avoiding tidy binaries. Emotional aftereffect lingers through quaking reverie, tied to Mara's arc, though some ambiguity borders confusion in abstract phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual signature in Mara's biased noticing of time-textures, and prose texture is distinct with rhythmic, lyric compression taught early; no dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets. Purposeful elision in mutable sanctuary pays off at closure without obscurity. Psychic distance shifts intentionally with emotional beats, like the child's moment, maintaining legibility under the lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose density is high with purposeful metaphors, but overwriting muddles peak beats, as in mixed "trembling fabric that resonated with both loss and renewal" and "Möbius strip of foliage," triggering −0.6 for figurative muddle without pattern payoff. Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent descriptions of the maze's breathing and quivering, dulling momentum in the final third (−0.4). Rhythm varies, yet template cadence in vine-pulsing sentences obscures propulsion at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hyperbolic geometry in a living maze transforms familiar time-memory tropes through specific, organic details like heartbeat-shifting leaves, feeling inevitable in hindsight; risk in non-linear accumulative structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry (+0.3). Core premise offers non-obvious angle on perception, committing fully without retreat. Avoids derivative echoes, with ingenuity in the halo fragment's geometric truths.</comment>
