<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The translator's motivation to graft meaning onto wounds is clear and intensifies through her interaction with the child's cast, revealing embodied emotions like the lotus-hearted ache without stock phrasing; interior contradiction shines in her shrewdly innocent gleam that balances raw truth with unpoisoned heart, culminating in the mutual recognition moment that earns endurance with felt sorrow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern breaks in motifs like mist and coral building to a Conceptual Repricing closure where anxieties bloom into strength, with felt cost in the sorrowful ache; orientation anchors early in the atrium at twilight, but causality feels elliptical in the anesthetic's dream-like tilt without a sharper tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight vividly anchors atmosphere, with sensory details like the pen's click and foggy veil mirroring internal anxieties; the brain coral vial as a micro-setting constrains choices by symbolizing resilience, charging the final droplet-sealing image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unknotting shared anxieties tightens once through decrypting the cast's notes, deepening via the coral's absorption that reweights fear into hope under the Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is legible in the lotus-hearted ache, but pressure feels more textural than agency-driven, lacking a sharper foreclosure of options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of grafting new meaning onto old wounds emerges organically from coral motifs and decrypted confessions, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights shared anxieties into strength without moralizing; subtext in gestures like tracing letters and placing the vial invites reflection on resilience amid ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable with perceptual signature in the translator's shrewdly innocent filter, noticing mist as a veil of anxieties; prose texture in rhythmic, lyric syntax like "gentle tide" modulates with emotional intensity, teaching patterned elision early and paying off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose density is high with purposeful metaphors like "sky is a cracked mirror of bombs" advancing atmosphere without loops, but occasional overwriting in stacked figuratives like vines and coral in one beat slightly muddles clarity; rhythm varies naturally, propelling to the resonant ending line on blooming strength.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of translation as coral-like grafting transforms familiar refugee trauma tropes through specific motifs like the cast's smudged notes and vial's essence, feeling inevitable in the sealing moment; risk in lyric compression heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, though premise echoes symbolic healing archetypes.</comment>
