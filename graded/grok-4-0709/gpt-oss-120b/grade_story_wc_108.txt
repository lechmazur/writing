<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The protagonist Mara's motivation as a phobia-ridden stunt double is clear and intensifies through her adaptive masking of fears, leading to an earned endurance in confronting vulnerability at the vial's price. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotions like "trembling certainty," showing contradictory impulses in her whispered promise to transform betrayal. However, some self-awareness veers into diagnostic label-speak, such as directly naming fears without mid-crisis embodiment, slightly flattening the internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elisions and density increases, with orientation anchored early in the rusted library under stars. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise in the final emergence, reweighting her identity with the conceptual cost of confessed vulnerability made legible in the amber fire rippling through veins. One meaningful deepening suffices, but causality feels elliptical in the shell-to-vial progression, with the lever's release relying on symbolic rather than strict linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars is vividly anchored with purposeful sensory details like groaning shelves and constellation maps, constraining choices as the dome's cracks guide discovery. Micro-setting elements, such as the seashell and cast, evolve causally and charge the final image of glowing walls. Tone tensions the surreal atmosphere effectively, mirroring internal transformation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of overcoming fear escalates through a meaningful deepening in decoding the notes, narrowing options with the lever's threat and forcing stance crystallization at the vial's price. One visible cost—the betrayal confession—charges the ending, but pressure feels more symbolic than visceral, with coincidence in the shell's appearance complicating without fully resolving. Agency via adaptive outwitting drives the turn, yet stakes remain somewhat abstract in the mythic leviathan fragment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of transformative betrayal emerges organically through images like the silver thread and amber vial, inviting reflection on vulnerability as power without direct statements. Subtext in the constellations spelling her name backwards offers resonant ambiguity, reweighting the premise in the final image. However, the ending veers close to thematic echo in the voice's thanks for embracing betrayal, slightly tidying the complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in selective noticing of dust-laden specters and humming sighs, modulating rhythm under pressure like the flickering lights. Purposeful compression in lyric mode teaches patterns early, paying off at closure without obscurity. No dialogue present, so those bullets are ignored; minor register drift into elevated diction fits the poetic voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and high density in multi-job sentences, but paraphrase loops appear in repetitive stems like "sighed" and "whispering," dulling momentum in the shell-lifting beat. Figurative language stacks densely in peak moments without full pattern payoff, such as mixed metaphors of bones and skins, triggering a -0.6 deduction. Clarity holds at closure, but scaffold redundancies like "trembling certainty" repeated obscure propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise of a stunt double decoding fears via a mythic shell offers fresh synthesis of vulnerability and performance, transforming tropes through specific adaptive actions like pairing stunts with symbols. Risk-taking in surreal elements heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in the backward name pattern. However, echoes of familiar magical artifact quests slightly hedge boldness without full subversion.</comment>
