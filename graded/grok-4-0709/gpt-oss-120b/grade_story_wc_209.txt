<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her childhood memory of night flowers, intensifying to compel her cathedral visit and emotional reckoning; interiority is concrete with embodied emotions like tears tracing cheeks, showing contradictory impulses between doubt and curiosity. The final endurance of her "lingering winter" is earned with felt cost, foreclosing cold doubts. Strength lies in micro-choices, such as aligning the postcard with glass, revealing value hierarchy. No second character, so relationship bullets ignored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, patterns of hush, light, and bloom build density to a Conceptual Repricing at the vision, reweighting Mara's understanding with felt cost in tears and released doubts. Orientation anchors early in the pavilion; structure holds as two shards with one transition. Closure lands on-page with the final smile and exhaled sigh, making before/after legible. Minor slip in ellipsis from pavilion to cathedral, but pattern holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like amber light through cracked panes and incense mingling with autumn scent filter through Mara's POV, with setting constraining choices like using the etched glass for revelation. Environment charges the final image of unfolding night-flowers echoing the glow. Micro-setting of postcards and lenses integrates into action, evolving causally. 9+ test met as recurring amber light and glass shape the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding night blooms signals early and deepens through the postcard alignment, narrowing options to a resonant reconfiguration with felt emotional cost. Under Accumulative lens, pattern break in the glowing etchings forces stance crystallization. Agency in Mara's actions drives escalation, though coincidence of the vision complicates without resolving. 9+ test nearly met but cost is more conceptual than unmistakable in agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of dialogue between darkness and light emerges organically from images like night-flowers and postcards, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights Mara's winter doubts. Subtext in umbral tenderness and hush invites reflection on seasonal promises without tidy morals. Strength in the final image offering conceptual repricing without statement. Minor thematic echo in the explicit "promise whispered" slightly undercuts subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Mara's artist-eyed noticing of light and shadows; rhythmic control in lyrical syntax heightens pressure without obscurity. Patterned elision in reflective blocks is taught early and pays off at closure. No dialogue present, so ignored. 9+ test met with distinct texture and no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid metaphors like "rivulets that glittered like silver threads," but occasional overwriting in peak beats, such as stacked light imagery, muddles clarity without pattern payoff. No major loops, but some synonym churn around "hush" and "amber" in the ending dulls momentum. High density advances atmosphere, though figurative excess touches the closure image slightly. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of postcards as memory bridges unlocking cathedral secrets transforms familiar curiosity trope through specific artist worldview and night-bloom premise. Risk in lyrical structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Inevitable in hindsight, as the vision grows from established patterns. Minor derivative echo of magical realism in glass revelation, but personalized ingeniously.</comment>
