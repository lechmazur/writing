<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The inspector's purposeful curiosity is rooted in consistent traits that drive his precise actions, like calibrating the chemical reaction, revealing embodied emotion through grief and solace at the photograph's click. Interiority is concrete but occasionally slips into stock phrasing, such as imagining the grain as a "tiny lighthouse," which feels less character-particular. The final renunciation of the grain's physical presence earns a meaningful endurance with felt cost, foreclosing its unspent time.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through layered imagery and patterns, culminating in a Charged Poise closure where the photograph reconfigures the grain's memory with emotional cost evident in the inspector's tremor of grief. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first sentence, avoiding penalties. One meaningful deepening occurs as the chemical reaction counts down, reweighting the stake without requiring causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The moonlit summit is vividly anchored with selective sensory details like jagged basalt and powdery dust, constraining choices as the tripod sinks and light shifts, charging the final image of the rising Earth. Atmosphere evolves causally with the dawn, mirroring internal melancholy without overt symbolism. Micro-setting of the kit and camera integrates into action, guiding the timed photograph.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of capturing the grain before dawn tightens once through the chemical countdown, deepening emotional cost but lacking a clear reversal or narrowed options. Pressure coheres but remains low-intensity, with the inspector's agency in endurance foreclosing the grain's watchfulness at a felt grief price. Coincidence of the wind stirs dust but complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of preserving fleeting memories emerges organically from the photograph's act, resonating through images like the vapor ghost without direct statements. Subtext in silence and implication invites reflection on ambition's cost, with the final whisper offering a non-literal reconfiguration of endings as new silences. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality, embracing complexity in melancholy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with a distinct poetic texture in syntax and rhythm, modulating with intensity as in the breathless instant before the click. Perceptual signature filters through the inspector's curiosity, noticing chemical plumes and shimmering grains selectively. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; purposeful compression in lyric mode is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose advances atmosphere with high density in metaphors like "dawning hush settled over the scene," but paraphrase loops, such as repeated "dawning hush" and synonym churn around light and silence, dull momentum without payoff. Rhythm varies, but template cadence in setup descriptions (e.g., "He unfolded... He calibrated... He set...") triggers a minor deduction. Information propulsion is clear, with no major artifacts obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise of archiving a cosmic memory in a sand grain via chemical timing offers a fresh sci-fi angle on preservation, transformed through specific details like the rover's cavity. Emotional complexity in grief-solace feels authentic, with the final reconfiguration arising from established patterns. Risk in lyric boldness heightens stakes without gimmickry, earning a small bonus.</comment>
