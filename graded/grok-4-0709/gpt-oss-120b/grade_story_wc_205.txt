<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation as a defunct revolutionary is clear and intensifies toward reimagining civilization, with embodied regret in her heavy heart at the end; however, internal conflict feels summarized rather than simultaneous in scene, lacking contradictory impulses during the recitation beat that could deepen her flaws under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and cadence shifts, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the dispute dissolves into collaboration with felt cost of burnished sorrow; orientation anchors early on the asteroid's terrace, and the storm event provides a meaningful deepening, though causality feels more poetic than strictly motivated in the projection tapestry moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting is vivid and purposeful, with copper spires and mirrors constraining Lira's plan and charging the final frescoes image; sensory details like silver rain and aurora are filtered through her poetic bias, evolving causally to mirror renewal without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake in resolving the archaeological dispute escalates through storm-timed mirror covering, deepening via the shard's projection that forces stance crystallization among elders; under Accumulative lens, pattern break in the collaborative chorus reweights cost legibly, but coincidence of the core pulse synchronization slightly complicates without fully resolving pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of renewal from sorrow emerges organically through recurring shard and mirror motifs that reweight meaning at closure without direct statements; subtext in Lira's verse ripples with implication, offering resonant ambiguity in the final vow that embraces complexity, though epiphanies border on pseudo-profundity in the symphony metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual signature in poetic noticing of aurora and rain; voice texture is distinct and rhythmic, modulating with emotional intensity in the recitation, and patterned elision teaches lyric compression early, paying off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm in storm cascade descriptions, avoiding loops and achieving high information density; however, stacked metaphors like "burnished sorrow" and "gilded relic" occasionally muddle in peak beats, though they serve the accumulative lens without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sci-fi baroque asteroid with poetic revolution transforms tropes through specific shard projections and storm mirrors, feeling inevitable in the cultural DNA rewrite; risk in lyric structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, offering fresh inflection on renewal.</comment>
