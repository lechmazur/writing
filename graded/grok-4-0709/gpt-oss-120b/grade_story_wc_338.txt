<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's methodical curiosity and empathetic motivation are consistently embodied through specific actions like aligning videos and tracing glyphs, revealing internal contradictions in her trembling arm and shielded openness. Emotions are contradictory and grounded, as in her whispering to the empty space amid grief, leading to an earned stasis in accepting the tear as a portal with felt cost. Minor slips in abstract labels like "intangible grief" slightly dilute embodiment, but the hierarchy of values shines in her final tracing that forecloses doubt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images of rain, stones, and projections, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the map's tear becomes a portal, reweighting silence with undeniable conceptual cost in the glowing archway. Orientation anchors early in the vault with the map framer's entry, and one meaningful deepening occurs via video alignment, tightening knowledge without causality breaks. The closure lands on-page with a resonant reconfiguration, though the mind's-eye door sigh feels slightly oblique.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The rain-scoured fresco vault is vividly sensory, with wet plaster smells and drumming rain mirroring the protagonist's empathetic tracing, constraining her choices by glistening walls that "breathe" the story. Atmosphere evolves causally, as projections bleed into walls, charging the final glow; micro-setting like the cracked stone recurs to charge the closure image. Selective details filter through POV bias, enhancing tone without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of interpreting silence escalates through pattern breaks in video comparisons, deepening via the tear as portal with a felt cost in shielded openness and community grief. One meaningful cadence shift narrows options, forcing stance crystallization in merging footage, though pressure feels more atmospheric than urgent. Coincidence in pulsing henge complicates without resolving, but stakes remain somewhat abstract until the final hymn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of empathy rewriting borders emerges organically from video alignments and the tear's repricing, inviting reflection through ambiguity in the sighing doors without confusion. Subtext in silent footage and pulsing stones resists tidy morals, embracing complexity with the protagonist's internal arc inextricable from interpreting silence. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by restoring rhythm, eliciting emotional aftereffect via the muted chorus.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable, with perceptual signature in faint lines and pulsing scars biased by the map framer's curiosity; voice modulates rhythmically under pressure, as in whispered acknowledgments. Prose texture is distinct with purposeful compression in layered silences, taught early and paid off at closure. Minor register drift into abstract diction like "mute stories" slightly jars, but no head-hopping or unwarranted certainty occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density in images like "stone echo" and "bruised purple sky," advancing atmosphere without major loops, though some paraphrase redundancy appears in repeated rain drumming. Rhythm varies naturally, but figurative stacks in peak beats like overlapping projections occasionally muddle clarity without payoff. No major artifacts obscure closure, and strong verbs propel the accumulative build.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise of empathetic map-framing via decade-spanning footage offers a fresh synthesis on silence and borders, transforming tropes through specific projections and pulsing henge that feel inevitable. Risk in lyric, abstract tone heightens stakes organically without gimmickry, though emotional complexity borders on familiar introspection. Core elements cohere as a singular vision, with the tear-as-portal inflection growing from particulars.</comment>
