<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's claustrophobia is embodied through shallow breath and fear of tight spaces, contrasting her spelunker background to create internal conflict that intensifies choices, culminating in her heart easing at the end with a felt cost of renewed purpose. Motivation to stand by the unremembered drives her actions consistently, shown in micro-choices like aligning the codex despite danger. However, interiority occasionally slips into stock phrasing, like "hands trembled," slightly diluting specificity under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery of sea and cables, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final burial with conceptual cost of sealing secrets. Orientation anchors early with the facility and Mara's entry, serving closure by echoing the initial hush. Causality holds via motivated ellipsis in the phase transition, with one meaningful deepening at the codex activation that reweights knowledge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The forgotten research facility is vividly specific with rusted doors, salt-scented air, and coiled cables that constrain Mara's movements and charge the translucent walls during transition. Sensory details like brine taste and humming panels reflect POV urgency, mirroring her internal shift. The recurring codex as micro-setting constrains choices and elevates the final image of burial on sand.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of tracking invisible things via codex escalates through textural density of glowing flecks and humming arrays, tightening to a deepening at the phase transition that narrows options with risk of void stranding. Agency in whispering the sequence and activating return forecloses paths with felt cost of pressure veil. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, one cadence shift reweights stakes effectively, though coincidence of tide apex slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of remembering the unremembered emerges organically through codex imagery and facility ghosts, culminating in a resonant final image of burial that reprices invisibility without moralizing. Subtext in pulsing cables and gold flecks invites reflection on forgotten pathways. Emotional aftereffect of quiet triumph avoids sentimentality, tied to Mara's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable, with perceptual signature in Mara's biased noticing of tight spaces and brine, modulating rhythm under stress like the breathless transition. Prose texture distinct in rhythmic, imagistic syntax that teaches patterned elision early and pays off at closure. No dialogue present, so policy skips; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in crashing hush to shimmering fields, advancing atmosphere without loops; metaphors like jellyfish walls cohere without muddle. Opening anchors voice, final line recharges motifs cleanly. Minor scaffold in one paraphrase loop ("pulsed faintly... gold flecks catching") dings slightly but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of claustrophobia with undersea phase tech transforms trope of forgotten facility into non-obvious exploration of invisible tracking, feeling inevitable via codex reprise. Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Avoids derivative echoes, committing to premise with authentic vision.</comment>
