<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in Lira's face blindness, compelling her to capture the sky as a daring act that explores limits, with the coin's indentations guiding her choices effectively. Interiority is concrete through tactile sensations like brushstrokes, but emotions lack strong contradictory impulses in scene, relying on abstract reflections like "limits were not walls but thresholds." The final endurance feels earned by prior rituals, foreclosing ordinary perception with the felt cost of impending erasure, though flaws complicate without deeper moral ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through layered pigments and motifs like the coin, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the mural holds amid demolition, reweighting limits with conceptual cost in the final image of dust-settled reverence. Orientation anchors early in the tree trunk library with Lira's setup, maintaining one continuous scene. Causality holds via pattern breaks in light and hush, with one meaningful deepening at the coin's press into pigment; no orientation debt applies as disorientation serves the heightened stillness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The hollowed tree trunk library is vividly specific, with bark-lined aisles and leaf-filled windows constraining Lira's craft and charging the final image of the sky cathedral amid collapse. Sensory details like ancient wood echoes and morning light are purposeful, filtered through her tactile bias, mirroring internal boundless azure. Environment evolves causally with demolition tremors, guiding choices without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mirroring the sky before demolition signals early, with one meaningful tightening as time pressure forces precise layers per coin notches, narrowing options under Accumulative/Textural lens. Agency in Lira's endurance forecloses ordinary limits with felt cost of potential erasure, legible in the hush and trembling. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolving, though internal-external weave is optional and lightly present.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of discovering limits emerges organically from Lira's craft and blindness, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights perception without stated moral, embracing complexity in her smile amid roar. Subtext in coin indentations and pigments implies boundless imagination, earning insight through specific struggles like mixing slurry. No thematic echo or moralizing mars the quiet ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature in tactile rhythms like fractally precise hands, modulating rhythm under demolition pressure without elision. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax, teaching patterned diction early for legibility at closure. No dialogue present, so policy skips; focalization controls knowledge modestly, avoiding unwarranted certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose density is high with multi-job sentences like "each brushstroke echoing a pattern she could not see," but repetitive stems (e.g., "She [action]" runs) and synonym loops around "limits" and "sky" create minor scaffold in mid-beats, deducting -0.6 without touching closure. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in final press of coin, with clean grammar and specific verbs; overwrought metaphors like "sunrise trapped in timber" muddle slightly but pay off in image. Opening anchors voice strongly, final line resolves with resonant dust reverence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of face-blind artist in a scholar's tree library transforms trope of condemned spaces through specific tactile craft, feeling inevitable with coin-guided mural defying demolition. Risk in poetic compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, adding +0.3. No derivative echoes, with authenticity in singular vision of limits as thresholds.</comment>
