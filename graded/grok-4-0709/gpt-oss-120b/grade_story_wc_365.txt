<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation to uncover the withheld truth is clear and drives choices, but interiority relies on abstract phrasing like "felt a sudden compulsion" without embodied contradiction or simultaneous impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages from shard activation to reality stitching, delivering on-page Decisive Change at the climax with felt cost in the shard's fracture; early orientation anchors effectively, though some elisions feel convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting of the abandoned spaceport repair bay is vivid and purposeful, with details like rusted hulls and cracked floor constraining actions and charging the final awakening image; sensory hierarchy reflects Lira's perceptual bias as a map maker.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering the truth escalates causally through the parallel universe step, tightening options with one meaningful deepening at the log entry reveal; cost is legible in the shard's destruction, but pressure feels more accumulative than narrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of weaving truths across worlds emerges organically from sensory maps and shard use, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing; however, some ambiguity borders on abstraction, like the universe's "whisper."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with perceptual signature in sensory details, but voice drifts into overwrought lyricism, as in "murmur of half-remembered dreams," without teaching a pattern; no dialogue present, so those bullets ignored.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose suffers from overwriting with stacked metaphors like "pearls in a glass bottle" and "cascade of light," creating density that muddles propulsion in peak beats; paraphrase loops, such as repeated "redirect" phrasing, dull momentum without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sensory mapping and parallel universe weaving feels fresh, transforming sci-fi tropes through Lira's perceptual lens; risk in lyric structure heightens resonance, but some echoes of multiverse clichés remain untransformed.</comment>
