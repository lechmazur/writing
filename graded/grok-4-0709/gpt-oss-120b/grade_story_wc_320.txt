<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Selin's motivation to reinterpret signals is clear and intensifies through her climb and tuning, rooted in pragmatic traits that compel choices like discarding assumptions; interiority is concrete via embodied actions, such as whispering intentions, revealing contradictory impulses between nostalgia and data. However, emotions lean toward performed serenity without strong contradictions under stress, slightly flattening peak moments. The final renunciation of linear time earns endurance with conceptual cost, but secondary characters (villagers) apply minimal pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned imagery and cadence shifts, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the chord broadcasts rebirth, reweighting decay with undeniable conceptual cost evident in the city's awakening and Selin's archival label. Orientation anchors early with the city over the gorge and Selin's role by ~50 words. One meaningful deepening occurs via the shard's insertion, tightening knowledge without requiring causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned radio tower city over the gorge is vividly specific, with sensory details like humming cables and silver-tinted beams filtered through Selin's perceptual bias, constraining her climb and interfacing actions. Environment evolves causally, as the perigee amplifies antennae, mirroring internal reconfiguration. A recurring object (shard) charges the final image of rebirth, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding beginnings in endings signals early and deepens via the tuning action, under Accumulative/Textural lens, with cadence shift reweighting cost through the city's revival and villagers' emergence. Pressure coheres but remains abstract, with one tightening that narrows options conceptually rather than through visceral trade-offs. Coincidence of the transmission complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of endings containing seeds emerges organically from images like the chord echoing founders' vibration and the shard as living key, inviting reflection on reinterpretation without tidy morals. Subtext in silences and implications, such as discarding assumptions, enriches complexity. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by broadcasting the chord, reweighting prior decay.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in signal-focused noticing and rhythmic prose modulating with intensity, such as thickening light during tuning. Purposeful compression in lyric mode teaches patterns early, paying off at closure. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; minor register drift into abstract diction under pressure slightly muddles immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with vivid metaphors like "broken harp over the gorge," advancing atmosphere, but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "serenely electric" without payoff) and template cadence in descriptive runs dull momentum in the tuning beat. Information density is high, but figurative overload in peak moments obscures clarity without teaching a pattern. Final line resolves by recharging motifs, but artifacts touch closure, triggering -0.6 deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy practicality transforms tropes like lost artifacts into a signal-interpreting premise, with non-obvious turns like rewriting syntax arising from character choices. Emotional specificity in pragmatic magic feels inevitable, heightening stakes through risk-taking in nonlinear signals. Core premise commits fully without retreat, avoiding generic settings.</comment>
