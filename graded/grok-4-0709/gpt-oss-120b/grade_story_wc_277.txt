<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to uncover truths is clear and rooted in her ancestral legacy, intensifying through her use of the pen nib at the console, which compels a higher-stakes revelation. Interiority is concrete via embodied perceptions like the nib's weight as a "secret waiting to be inked," revealing contradictory impulses of solemn duty and playful grin under pressure. However, emotions occasionally lean into abstract labels like "orbits of regret" without fully contradictory embodiment in peak moments, slightly diluting the internal conflict at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure follows because/therefore linkages from the journalist's call to Mira's observatory ascent and nib activation, leading to an on-page Decisive Change where the ledger is revealed and regrets unwind. Orientation anchors who (Mira), where (observatory), and when (dusk) by the first sentence, with no disorientation debt. Closure lands with felt conceptual cost in the city's accountability shift, but some elliptical metaphors create minor causality haze in the holographic projection beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The echoing observatory above clouds is vividly anchored with sensory details like humming telescopes and glassy dome reflections, filtered through Mira's observant POV to mirror her internal quest. Setting constrains choices by providing the console as a resource that enables the nib's use and charges the final image of swirling skies as turning pages. Sensory hierarchy prioritizes auditory and visual immediacies during crisis, evolving causally with the machine's response and siren tremble.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Under Causal lens, the dominant stake of discovering hidden truths signals early and tightens once through the nib's insertion, narrowing options via proof by contradiction and forcing a trade-off in intervening against ancestral silence. Agency manifests in Mira's decisive actions, with a conceptual cost in responsibility's weight, legible at the grin and handover. However, pressure feels somewhat abstract without a sharper on-page reversal or visceral price, limiting escalation depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of uncovering veiled truths through contradiction emerges organically from Mira's method and the ledger's revelation, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the city's "new dawn." Subtext operates in images like orbiting regrets and the nib as ancestral relic, inviting reflection on complacent headlines without confusion. The final image of swirling skies reprices the premise non-literally, but occasional direct statements like "prove that the false premise cannot hold" border on thematic echo, slightly reducing resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature biased toward journalistic metaphors like ink falling "like rain on dead stories." Voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, figurative syntax that modulates with intensity, such as whispering promises under stress. Minimal dialogue feels natural and subtextual in the journalist's laugh and Mira's handover line, advancing the plot without register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid images like the dome as a "floating thought," but overwriting in peak beats stacks metaphors (e.g., orbits, echoes, pages) without full payoff, triggering a -0.6 deduction for figurative muddle. Syntactic variety supports rhythm, yet paraphrase loops appear in adjacent descriptions of regrets and headlines, dulling momentum at the console hypothesis. Clarity remains high, with no major artifacts obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise ingeniously synthesizes a newsprint heiress with a sci-fi observatory and mathematical proof, transforming tropes of scandal-hunting through specific motifs like the nib's lineage. Originality shines in the non-obvious fusion of solemn playfulness, with the final reconfiguration feeling inevitable from ancestral whispers. Risk-taking in metaphorical density heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, though some echoes of detective archetypes limit peak freshness.</comment>
