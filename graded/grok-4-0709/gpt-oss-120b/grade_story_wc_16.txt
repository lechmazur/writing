<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation to restore trust is clear and rooted in Elara's traits, intensifying through her decoding actions, but interiority relies on abstract metaphors like "cautious exuberance of a child" rather than embodied contradictions; emotions are performed via stock phrasing without simultaneous impulses in scene, though the final pledge shows a credible endurance with duty's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds via patterned imagery of promises and symphonies leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final pledge and archive's awakening, with felt cost of renewed duty; orientation anchors early in the vault, but causality feels elliptical without a sharper tightening, as in the vague "time pressed" without concrete consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The extinct language archive is vividly sensory with dust, melodies, and pulsing shelves that constrain Elara's decoding choices and charge the final image of breathing parchments; details evolve causally as vibrations resonate through walls, mirroring her internal restoration without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring trust tightens via accumulating glyph decodings under the textural lens, with one meaningful deepening in the knot's unwinding that narrows options; cost of duty is felt in the final pledge, but pressure remains abstract without a visible trade-off forcing stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of mending broken promises emerges organically from glyph interconnections and the covenant's restoration, culminating in a resonant final image of the swelling symphony without stated moral; subtext in silences and vibrations invites reflection on trust's fragility, though some ambiguity feels purposeful yet borders on vagueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual bias toward musical metaphors, and prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, lyric compression that teaches patterns early; no dialogue present, but voice modulates with emotional intensity, as in the trembling ink, without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and high density in metaphors like "ink that shimmered like sunrise," but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "promise" phrasings) and mixed figures (e.g., knot as storm then droplets) dull momentum in peak decoding beats; clarity holds, yet overwriting obscures propulsion without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic magic and musical truths transforms fantasy tropes through specific glyph promises, feeling inevitable in the covenant's rebirth; risk in lyric density heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, though premise echoes familiar archive quests without bolder subversion.</comment>
