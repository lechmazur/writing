<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Arlen's motivation to understand scent-triggered tears is clear and rooted in his backstory, intensifying through embodied grief that compels his final realization; interiority is concrete with contradictory impulses, like caution versus curiosity, shown in his handling of the vial. Emotions are embodied in stinging eyes and tightening throat, avoiding stock phrasing. The meaningful change—transforming grief into understanding—forecloses passive mourning with felt cost, evident in his whispered promise to catalog aromas.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered scents and memories toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where Arlen reweights grief as a lantern, with felt emotional cost in his broadened grieving; orientation anchors early in the greenhouse. However, causality feels elliptical in places, like the vial's acquisition, slightly loosening linkage before the vapor release beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting is vivid and purposeful, with amber panes and extinct plants constraining Arlen's choices and charging the final image of petrichor blending with perfume; sensory details like pulsing vines and ultraviolet glow reflect POV bias and mirror internal grief. Environment evolves causally, affecting action as vines pulse and release scents that deepen the realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding scent-triggered tears escalates through textural density in the vapor's collage of moments, forcing a deepening that reweights grief with emotional cost in stinging eyes and broadened mourning; one meaningful cadence shift at uncorking suffices, but pressure remains mostly internal without sharper narrowing of options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory's impact through scent emerges organically from particulars like lavender tea and petrichor, culminating in a resonant final image of grief as a lantern without stated moral; subtext in translucent petals and crystal shadows invites reflection on forgotten histories. Emotional aftereffect is concrete, avoiding sentimentality through complex grief for extinct plants.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature in aromatic caution and scent-filtered observations; prose texture is distinct with rhythmic, lyric diction that modulates under emotional intensity, like swirling vapor. Minor register drift into elevated phrasing feels voice-motivated in this wistful tone, and single whispered dialogue advances insight naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "phosphorescent vines begin to pulse," but occasional paraphrase loops, such as repeated scent-memory echoes, slightly dull momentum without obscuring closure. Rhythm varies naturally, and metaphors cohere without muddle, though some stacked figuratives in the vapor beat border on overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of extinct plants, scent memories, and ultraviolet revelation feels inevitable, transforming familiar grief tropes through specific lantern broker profession and crystal shadows tone; risk in lyric accumulation heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers fresh angle on olfactory triggers, committing fully with authentic vision.</comment>
