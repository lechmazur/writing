<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marlowe's motivation to decode the stranger's gesture intensifies through his observations, rooted in his eccentric isolation, with embodied emotion in trembling fingers and a lighter heart at closure; however, interiority leans on abstract labels like "solitary witness" without enough contradictory impulses in scene, and the final renunciation feels earned but lacks a sharper visible cost beyond conceptual lightness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned observations of tide gaps and flower echoes, leading to a resonant reconfiguration in the final placement and lamp-lighting with conceptual cost of transformed isolation; orientation anchors early with the dock and twilight, but causality is loose with the wind's "answer" feeling more poetic than motivated, slightly softening the closure's linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The opal dock in mist vividly anchors the atmosphere, with sensory details like bruised lavender sea and salt spray mirroring Marlowe's isolation; the setting constrains his investigation by tying it to tide rhythms, charging the final image of golden ribbons, though some details like the stone tower feel underutilized beyond initial setup.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding the gesture tightens through tide observations, culminating in a deepening realization that reweights his loneliness with hope, but pressure remains internal and abstract without a clear on-page reversal or felt cost beyond emotional shift; coincidence of the journal's arrival complicates without resolving, fitting the lens but lacking sharper agency-driven escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of borrowed memories and persistent isolation emerges organically through recurring flower and tide motifs, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights solitude as companionship without moralizing; subtext in gestures like whispering to the wind invites reflection, though some direct statements like "a silent request to remember" border on overt, slightly diluting ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice maintains consistent perceptual signature through Marlowe's biased noticing of pauses and echoes, with rhythmic control in phrases like "softly persistent"; no dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets, but some elision in the stranger's gesture is taught early and paid off at closure, though dense syntax occasionally obscures immediacy under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose features vivid imagery like "bruised lavender" and varied rhythm, but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "softly persistent" and "borrowed memory" churn) and mixed metaphors (e.g., tide borrowing flower's memory) dull momentum in peak beats; information density is high yet overwritten in the realization paragraph, obscuring propulsion without harming closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise of decoding via tide gaps offers a fresh synthesis of eccentricity and mysticism, transforming lighthouse tropes through specific details like the Edelweiss; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens emotional stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the lamp-lighting, though it echoes familiar isolation narratives without bolder subversion.</comment>
