<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to prove her lineage for asylum is clear and intensifies through the ink ritual, compelling her final resolve; interiority is concrete in moments like feeling grief's vibrations in her soles, revealing character under pressure. However, emotions lean toward abstract labels like "fluid resolve" without strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, limiting depth. The ending's endurance of her father's legacy shows credible change with felt cost, but backstory reflection exceeds BRR allowance slightly without tilting present stance via micro-choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through grief's density and pattern break when ink glows, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where asylum transforms into a covenant with conceptual cost in reweighted fairness. Orientation anchors early in the prep room with Mara waiting, no penalty applied. Causality holds via textural escalation, but some ellipsis in the ink's activation feels unmotivated, slightly weakening linkage to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room anchors vividly with lilies, incense, and grief's fog, constraining Mara's waiting and charging the final image as death sings with vitality. Sensory details like vibrations in soles and fluttering curtains are selective and purposeful, mirroring internal transformation without overt symbolism. Micro-setting of the ink pot on the table evolves causally, guiding the ritual's choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of securing asylum via fair trade proof signals early and deepens through grief's pressure, forcing stance crystallization in the ink ritual under Accumulative/Textural lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when fog thickens and ink glows, narrowing options with felt cost in liquefied doubts. However, pressure remains somewhat abstract, with no clear reversal testing commitment, and coincidence of mourners' grief complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of transforming deception into honest reciprocity emerges organically from Mara's ritual and the ink's alchemy, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in fairness's calculus. Subtext in grief's fog and swirling ink invites reflection on rigid ideologies, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights asylum without stating a moral. Emotional aftereffect is concrete through vitality in death, but some abstract philosophizing like "shared willingness to dissolve" borders on assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable, with perceptual signature in Mara's biased noticing of grief's vibrations and ink's swirl, modulating rhythm under pressure. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax like "midnight river," purposeful for lyric mode, and elision of ritual mechanics is taught early. However, occasional register drift into academic diction like "calculus of moral exchange" clashes with voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through images like "liquid light spreading like veins of gold," and rhythm varies naturally. However, paraphrase loops appear in adjacent descriptions of ink and grief (e.g., "swirl like a midnight river" and "ripping as if answering"), triggering -0.4, and mixed metaphors like "dissolve the stone walls" slightly muddle clarity in peak beats. No artifacts touch closure, but template cadence in whispered words reduces propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical realism in a funeral home transforms trope of inherited artifact through specific calculus of fairness, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in textural, non-linear buildup heightens stakes without gimmickry, with emotional specificity in deathly vitality avoiding generics. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on asylum, but echoes familiar mystical object tales slightly without full personalization.</comment>
