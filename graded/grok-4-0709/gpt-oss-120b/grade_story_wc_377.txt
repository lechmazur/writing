<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tuner's motivation to preserve wonder is clear and intensifies through actions like tightening joints, rooted in consistent traits of harmony and silence; interiority is concrete via embodied interactions with the sculpture, showing contradictory impulses in his fierce yet mute pursuit. However, emotions lean toward abstract labels like "muted vigor" without fully embodied contradictions under pressure, slightly weakening peak moments. The final whisper reveals a hierarchy of values with felt cost in enduring silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and cadence shifts, with orientation anchored early in the bluff workshop; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise in the final promise, reweighting silence with conceptual cost of fading wonder. However, causality is loose without motivated ellipsis changing options, and the ending lacks a decisive on-page cost beyond implication, softening the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The whispering bluff above clouds is vividly anchored with purposeful sensory details like wind and sunrise, filtered through the tuner's bias; it constrains choices by enabling the sculpture's motion and charges the final image of glistening hope. Environmental evolution, like shadows rippling, mirrors internal states without overt symbolism, supporting tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving wonder is signaled early but remains abstract with minimal tightening; under Accumulative/Textural lens, cadence shifts like wind's tempered vigor deepen resonance slightly, but pressure lacks a meaningful reversal or cost, with no on-page trade-off forcing stance crystallization. Coincidence of wind aids without complicating, undercutting agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of silence preserving truth emerges organically from images like the humming iceberg and muted symphonies, inviting reflection through ambiguity without confusion; the final glistening hope offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration of wonder's endurance. Subtext in gestures like tightening joints enriches complexity, avoiding tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with consistent perceptual signature in poetic noticing of wind and light; prose texture is distinct with rhythmic, lyric diction that modulates emotionally, teaching patterned elision early for legibility. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; minor register drift into abstract terms like "symphonies of truth" slightly jars but serves voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high density in images like "sunrise kisses the sky," but repetitive stems (e.g., "he" openings) and synonym loops around "glisten" and "mute" create template cadence, dulling momentum in the final third. Clarity holds with varied rhythm, but overwriting in figurative stacks muddles peak beats without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise of translating wind into silent symphonies via kinetic ice offers fresh synthesis of art and nature, transformed through specific details like the copper arm; risk in lyric structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. However, echoes familiar poetic tropes of wonder in silence, lacking a bolder non-obvious angle.</comment>
