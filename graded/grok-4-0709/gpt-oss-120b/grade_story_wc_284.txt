<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The spy's motivation rooted in guilt drives choices like tracing snow codes, but interiority relies on abstract epiphanies rather than embodied contradictions, as in the sudden warmth from the vial without conflicting impulses. The final renunciation of past ties feels earned by accumulation but lacks a visible micro-choice hierarchy under pressure. No second character, so relationship bullets ignored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural, with patterns of mist and codes building to a Conceptual Repricing closure where courage is redefined as a state, carrying conceptual cost of past guilt in the phoenix light. Orientation anchors early on the bluff at dawn, no penalty. Causality is loose, with metaphorical leaps like the glowing map not tightly linked, but holds under lens without breaking closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful details like swirling vapors and snow mantle filter through POV bias, mirroring internal thaw; the bluff and valley constrain choices, charging the final spring image with renewal. Sensory selection narrows under urgency, evolving causally from frost to melt. No occupational depth needed here.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of redemption tightens once through the descent and realization, deepening via snow melt with felt cost of dissolved ties, coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens. Pressure grows via patterns but lacks a clear reversal narrowing options; coincidence of glowing codes complicates without resolving. Agency in endurance forecloses past paths, but stakes remain somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of healing through courage emerges from images like the pillbox map and phoenix light, offering resonant non-literal answer in the final reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in silences and whispers invites reflection on ambiguity. Earned from particulars, but occasional direct statements like "fixing what's broken" edge toward assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person POV with distinct poetic texture in syntax and rhythm, modulating with intensity like breath-formed glyphs; perceptual signature biases toward redemption motifs. No dialogue, so ignored. Purposeful compression in lyric mode taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and high density with metaphors like silver hush, but mixed vehicles (e.g., wind granting forgiveness) create minor muddle in peak beats, deducting -0.4; no major loops, but some paraphrase in guilt scar descriptions dull momentum. Clarity holds at closure; opening anchors voice strongly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spy trope with magical realism in snow codes and pillbox map feels organic, transforming redemption arc through specific images; risk in poetic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. However, echoes familiar fantasy quests without bold non-obvious angle, limiting ingenuity.</comment>
