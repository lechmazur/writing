<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to excavate truth is clear and intensifies through patient actions like reassembling letters, leading to an earned realization at the diamond's discovery. Interiority is concrete but occasionally slips into summary, with embodied emotions shown in her smile and inhalation, though contradictory impulses are understated. The final renunciation of exploitation forecloses paths with a felt cost of responsibility, making her flaws and sharp observation drive choices effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages from collecting fragments to reassembling them and following the map, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where the stillpoint is revealed as mental, with conceptual cost in shifting the world's perception. Orientation anchors who, where, and when early in the wasteland orchard post-liquidation. One meaningful tightening occurs at the diagram's emergence, sufficient for length, though the ending's protection seal feels slightly additive without deeper causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard amid radioactive dust storms is vividly anchored with sensory details like phosphorescent fruit and ozone scent, constraining Mira's choices through storms and irradiation. Setting evolves causally, with storms ceasing at closure, charging the final image of shimmering trees. Micro-details like the gnarled apple tree and stone cradle integrate into action, reflecting POV bias toward observation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering the stillpoint signals early and tightens once through reassembling letters, narrowing options and deepening knowledge under causal lens, with coincidence (pulse in air) complicating but not resolving. Agency in Mira's decisions leads to stance crystallization, foreclosing exploitation with visible cost of responsibility. Moral calculus between truth and protection sharpens the peak, though stakes remain somewhat abstract without visceral layering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth blooming amid lies emerges organically from Mira's reconstruction and the diamond's inscription, inviting reflection through ambiguity in the curse's debunking without tidy morals. Subtext in images like the flawed diamond and stillpoint reweights the premise at closure with conceptual repricing. Emotional aftereffect arises from her exhilaration and responsibility, tied to the arc without assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-specific, with perceptual signature in Mira's observational bias toward ink hues and ozone scents. Narrative voice modulates rhythmically with pressure, accelerating in the storm and breathing at realization. No dialogue present, so not evaluated; purposeful compression in descriptive beats is taught and legible under causal lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose advances with high density and varied rhythm, weaving vivid images like "whispering sea of ash" without loops, though occasional figurative stacking in descriptions borders on overwriting without harming clarity. Sentence propulsion supports momentum, with strong verbs and specific nouns; no artifacts obscure closure. Final line recharges motifs effectively, but some redundancy in dust storm mentions slightly dulls mid-beat flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes post-apocalyptic wasteland with a cursed diamond and debunker protagonist in a fresh way, transforming tropes through specific details like reassembling letters and mental stillpoint. Emotional complexity in Mira's responsibility adds ingenuity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk in conceptual closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though echoes of familiar quest narratives limit top originality.</comment>
