<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to name nameless fears is clear and intensifies through her actions, compelling the climax of remembering her love's name; interiority is concrete via embodied pulses like a "second heart," with contradictory grief and hope acting simultaneously. However, emotions lean toward performed abstraction in phrases like "weight of centuries of unfinished farewells," bordering on therapy-speak without full mid-crisis irrationality. The final renunciation of mourning earns stasis with felt cost, but flaws feel balanced rather than complicating choices deeply.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned echoes and cadence shifts, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where naming reweights grief into gratitude with conceptual cost legible in the halo's ascent. Orientation anchors early in the observatory at dusk, with causality in image accumulation rather than linear turns. One meaningful deepening suffices, as crystal naming tightens the stake of sacrifice. Minor elision in sailor's name reveal pays off at closure without breaking pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The ancient observatory at dusk is vividly anchored with sensory details like "amber of day" and "cracked dome," filtering through Lira's bias to mirror her grief; it constrains choices by providing light that crystallizes monsters, charging the final aurora image. Atmosphere evolves causally with events, turning pillars into "conduits of luminous memory." Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, with dust motes as prisms integrating action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of releasing nameless fears through sacrifice echoes tightens via accumulative naming, deepening to stance crystallization in the final remembrance; one cadence shift reweights cost from burden to bridge. Agency in whispering names forecloses mourning with felt emotional price. Pressure coheres under textural lens but remains somewhat abstract, with no visible trade-off beyond internal shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of naming to redeem sacrifice emerges organically from images like crystallizing monsters and aurora, inviting reflection on grief's complexity without tidy morals; final image offers resonant, non-literal repricing of loss as gratitude. Subtext in silences and implications deepens ambiguity. Core concept integrates via events, but occasional direct statements like "echo of sacrifice transformed" edge toward assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable in close third-person, with perceptual signature biased toward mournful echoes and light; prose texture in rhythmic, lyric syntax reflects Lira's state, teaching patterned elision early for legibility. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets. Psychic distance shifts intentionally with intensity, and diction stays within her lexicon without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose density is high with purposeful metaphors like "cloak dripping with sighs," advancing atmosphere without loops, but occasional overwriting in peak beats muddles clarity, such as stacked figuratives in crystal chanting. Rhythm varies naturally, but some paraphrase loops appear in naming sequences, like repeated "each" structures. No major artifacts touch closure, and propulsion maintains momentum through image accumulation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reaper mythology with nautical fears transforms tropes through specific atlas interactions and naming ritual, feeling inevitable in the aurora's reconfiguration; risk in lyric abstraction heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generics, but premise echoes familiar grief-redemption arcs without fully bold subversion.</comment>
