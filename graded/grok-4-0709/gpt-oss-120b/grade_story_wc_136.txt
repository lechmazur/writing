<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to find the fortress is clear and rooted in her traits as a meticulous mapper, intensifying through discoveries that compel her forward, with embodied emotions like "tremor of certainty in her fingertips" showing internal conflict effectively. However, interiority occasionally slips into stock poetic phrasing, such as "trembling certainty in her chest," which feels less character-particular under pressure. The final renunciation of the ordinary is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a safe path with the felt cost of perpetual daring, satisfying the 9+ test minimally but without strong contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned discoveries like pavement arrows and pulsing clues, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the fortress revelation reweights her role with conceptual cost of becoming a conduit, visible in her promise to return. Orientation anchors who, where, and when early via the mapper in the misty streets, with no disorientation debt. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, but the ellipsis from doorway to vault feels slightly unmotivated, though it doesn't break the textural cadence at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The starlit vault in mist is vividly sensory and purposeful, constraining choices by guiding her via breathing ivy and pulsing arrows, while the micro-setting of cracks and parchment charges the final image of aligned streets approving her mission. Details filter through her analytical-artistic POV, evolving causally as cracks widen and echo history, mirroring her internal unraveling without overt symbolism. The environment directly shapes the closure by making guidance visible post-revelation, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of unraveling mysteries escalates through density of clues and a cadence shift at the ledger's glow, forcing stance crystallization in her awe-filled commitment, with felt cost of abandoning the ordinary. One meaningful deepening via the staircase and door unlock narrows options effectively for this length, but pressure feels more atmospheric than agency-driven, with no strong reversal testing her want versus fear. Coincidence of the ticket's fit complicates without resolving, yet the ending's reconfiguration lands with legible conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of daring to uncover hidden narratives emerges organically from particulars like the phantom punch and constellation maps, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer at the ledger where unspoken truths become a living archive, reweighting her mapper identity without moralizing. Subtext in images like breathing ivy and pulsing arrows invites reflection on precision versus imagination, avoiding sentimentality through complex ambiguity. The final image of aligned cracks offers earned wisdom from her journey, satisfying the 9+ test, though thematic echo in "fortress of unspoken truths" borders on direct statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; single POV remains stable with perceptual signature in selective noticing of cracks and glows, biased by her analytical-artistic lens. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, metaphorical syntax like "each step unfolded layers," modulating with intensity, but occasional register drift into elevated diction ("starlit vault in mist") feels slightly unmotivated for her voice under stress. Patterned elision in discoveries is taught early and pays off at closure, with no head-hopping, but psychic distance shifts inconsistently in reflective moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose advances atmosphere through dense, multi-job sentences like "the punch seemed to pulse whenever she followed," but overwriting in peak beats with stacked metaphors ("skeletal fingers," "colossal eye") muddles clarity without pattern payoff, triggering -0.6 density penalty. Rhythm varies naturally, yet paraphrase loops appear in repetitive "urging her" phrases, adding -0.4 for template cadence in the staircase descent. Information density is high overall, but these artifacts dull the closure image slightly without obscuring cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise of a mapper unraveling city mysteries via phantom clues offers a fresh synthesis of cartography and the supernatural, transformed through specific details like the ticket punch unlocking truths, feeling inevitable in her commitment. Risk-taking in lyrical structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, earning +0.3 bonus, as the conceptual fortress subverts familiar quest tropes organically. No close echoes of famous scenes, but the motif of arrows risks generic symbolism without fully personalizing it.</comment>
