<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's cautious hope motivates her interference effectively, with embodied emotion in her surge of optimism and final smile, but interior contradictions are summarized rather than shown in simultaneous impulses during key setup, limiting depth; the ending renunciation of naivety feels earned yet oblique without sharper cost visibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern breaks in signal interference building to a Resonant Reconfiguration of unity, including Charged Poise in the thrumming sky; orientation anchors early in the radio station vigil, but minor ellipsis in community response slightly softens causal payoff at closure without breaking lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The university radio station constrains Mara's choices vividly, supplying tools like the transmitter that charge the interference beat and final image of flickering lights; atmospheric details like humming static and dust-touched charts mirror internal hope, with sensory specificity evolving causally to support tone without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of outwitting tricksters tightens through one meaningful deepening in the subsonic setup, narrowing options with modulation risks and forcing stance crystallization against chaos; cost is felt in ongoing vigilance, but coincidence in community humming slightly complicates without fully resolving pressure under the textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of balanced interference for unity emerges organically from images like morphed signals and shared pulses, inviting reflection on human ingenuity without moralizing; the final image reprices cosmic power plays non-literally, reweighting division with conceptual cost, though subtext in ethereal grit could layer more contradictory ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with perceptual bias in Mara's star-reading focus, and prose texture distinct through rhythmic, patterned diction like "ethereal grit" that teaches compression early; no dialogue present, but voice modulates with pressure in the soft tone transmission, avoiding head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose density advances atmosphere with vivid rhythms in phrases like "humming with restless static," but minor paraphrase loops in signal descriptions (e.g., pulses slipping and persisting) dull momentum slightly without obscuring closure; syntactic variety supports propulsion, though some figurative stacking in the ending sky shimmer borders overwriting without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic tricksters with campus politics transforms familiar division tropes through specific subsonic interference, feeling inevitable in the valley chorus; risk in extending to town experimentation heightens communal stakes organically, avoiding gimmickry and committing to ethereal grit vision.</comment>
