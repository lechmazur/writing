<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lia's motivation to uncover deleted files intensifies credibly through discoveries, rooted in her attentive traits, leading to an earned shift from curiosity to purpose; interiority is concrete but occasionally slips into abstract labels like "surge of purpose." Emotions are embodied in her smile and vow, with micro-choices like fabricating the post revealing values under pressure. No second character, so relationship bullets ignored; the final renunciation of absence carries felt cost without stock epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Inferred Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages from tracing metadata to posting the tribute, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where absence becomes presence, with conceptual cost in guarding lost voices; orientation anchors early in the vaulted archives. Closure lands on-page with the crew's message and Lia's vow, reweighting the archive's meaning. One meaningful tightening suffices, but minor ellipsis in file vanishing feels unmotivated without payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The social network archive is vividly sensory with humming data, amber lights, and static air, filtered through Lia's attentive POV; details like obsolete emojis and rusted racks constrain her navigation and charge the final pulsing echoes. Micro-setting of the terminal and vault subtly mirrors her internal shift from absence to presence. Sensory selection reflects urgency, evolving causally without repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of solving the cold case escalates causally through the numbers' pulses, tightening via the fabricated post that scatters breadcrumbs, narrowing options to the hidden vault; one deepening suffices, but cost feels oblique until the final reconfiguration. Agency in posting and compiling drives the turn with visible trade-off in spreading the lie. Coincidence of the photo resurfacing complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of digital afterlife and resurrected memories emerges organically from patterns like echoing songs and phantom breadcrumbs, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the crew's message that reweights absence as presence. Subtext in silences and implications enriches complexity without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete discoveries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in attentive details like glowing numbers; prose texture is distinct with rhythmic metaphors like "pulsing code." No dialogue, so ignored; purposeful compression in discoveries pays off at closure without head-hopping. Syntax modulates with intensity, teaching lyric patterns early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing through vivid images like "silvery insignia stitched onto a forgotten hoodie," but occasional paraphrase loops (e.g., repeating "forgotten" motifs) slightly dull momentum without obscuring closure. Rhythm varies naturally, with strong verbs and specific nouns; no major artifacts touch the final image. Information propels forward, integrating metaphors cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi archive mystery with embedded codes transforms missing persons trope through specific details like the 17-42-108 sequence and digital afterlife, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric echoes heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Avoids derivatives, committing to premise with authentic vision.</comment>
