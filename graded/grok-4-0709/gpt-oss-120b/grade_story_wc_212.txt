<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to discover borrowed time is clear and intensifies through her actions, rooted in her seed saver traits, but interiority relies on abstract labels like "furiously tranquil" without deeply embodied contradictions under pressure. The final planting choice shows credible endurance with conceptual cost, yet lacks visible trade-offs in micro-choices. Strength in the whispered phrase from her grandmother anchoring reflection to tilt present stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and cadence shifts to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final planting and realization, with conceptual cost legible in surrendering the present. Orientation anchors early in the icebound atrium, avoiding penalties. Closure lands on-page with the atrium's warm pulse reweighting the cycle, though causality feels more textural than chained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The icebound atrium is vividly specific with sensory details like humming glass and melting mist, filtered through Mira's POV to mirror her calm storm, and it evolves causally to charge the final green hope ribbons. Setting constrains choices by providing the basin and earth for planting. Weakness in some overt symbolism, like mist forming a hand, bordering on convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reopening the covenant tightens through the vortex's pull and melting walls, deepening via textural density to force Mira's surrender with felt conceptual cost in borrowed time. One meaningful cadence shift suffices, but pressure feels abstract rather than viscerally narrowing options. Strength in the acorn cap's vanishing as a deepening that reweights the phoenix's eternity glimpse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical growth and borrowed time emerges organically from images like the vortex and seed planting, offering resonant ambiguity in time as texture without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like the mist's hand implies complexity. Final image reweights the premise non-literally, charging the cycle's wild serenity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual bias in Mira's sensory focus on textures, and prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax that modulates with intensity. Some register drift into elevated diction like "vortex inheritance" feels slightly unmotivated for her voice. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision in time concepts is patterned and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purposeful metaphors advancing atmosphere, but paraphrase loops like repeated "borrowed time" texture descriptions create minor redundancy without payoff, and mixed metaphors (e.g., storm of calm churning while tranquil) muddle clarity in peak beats. Rhythm varies, but some template cadence in action sequences dulls propulsion. Strength in final line's image resolving with high density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seed saving with phoenix myth and time vortex feels organic and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like the acorn cap anchoring chaos. Risk in lyric compression heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on inheritance, committed fully without retreat.</comment>
