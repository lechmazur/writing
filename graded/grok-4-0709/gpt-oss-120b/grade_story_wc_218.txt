<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to foster interspecies respect is clear and rooted in her traits, intensifying through her systematic actions like wrapping copper wire, leading to an earned endurance that forecloses her isolation with visible cost in her looming deadline. Interiority is concrete, embodied in her diary entries and calm under pressure, showing contradictory impulses like plotting beyond death while accepting it. However, emotions occasionally lean toward performed calm rather than raw contradiction, as in her whispered secret at the climax, which feels slightly stock.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Causal, with because/therefore linkages like Mara's remodeling leading to the orchard's vigor transfer and the council's decree lift, holding through closure as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost in reweighted time limits. Structure fits scope with one continuous narrative arc across shards, anchored early in the island setting and her six-month deadline. Closure lands on-page with the council's honor and her revitalization, but the vigor transfer feels like a slight convenient ellipsis without fully motivated mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The temple orchard with living stone pillars is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices like Mara's remodeling and charging the final image where oaks glow, mirroring her internal harmony. Sensory details are selective, filtered through her POV, with chlorophyll clouds and mica veins evolving causally. Environment affects action, as roots and pillars enable the bio-energy dialogue, supporting theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of her six-month deadline signals early and tightens through her remodeling, deepening via the orchard's response that forces stance crystallization against fear, with felt cost in her shortening breath. Under Causal lens, pressure coheres with one meaningful intensification as visitors learn respect, but resolution relies on coincidental vigor transfer, slightly undercutting agency. Moral calculus between harmony and inevitability sharpens the peak, though stakes occasionally feel abstract until the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of interspecies respect emerges organically from events like copper wrapping enabling tree-stone dialogue, culminating in a resonant final image of unified breathing without stated moral. Subtext in gestures like children's sketches invites reflection on harmony's power, embracing complexity with ambiguity in her extended life. Emotional aftereffect is concrete, avoiding sentimentality, but epiphany at the end borders on tidy wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Mara's systematic observations like noting frequencies, and rhythmic prose modulating with dawn rituals. Voice has distinct texture in poetic syntax, like "waning horizon," consistent under stress. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; minor register drift into elevated diction feels voice-motivated but occasionally ornate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through images like "bruised amber" sea, but occasional overwriting in metaphors like "conductive tendons" muddles clarity without payoff. Rhythm varies naturally, with strong verbs and specificity, though a paraphrase loop in describing the wire's hum and resonance dulls momentum slightly. No major artifacts touch closure, and final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of architectural secrets with bio-energy and interspecies harmony feels fresh, transforming eco-fantasy tropes through specific choices like copper-wrapped oaks enabling ancestral echoes. Bold risk in positive resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise implications. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on mortality and nature, with emotional specificity avoiding generics.</comment>
