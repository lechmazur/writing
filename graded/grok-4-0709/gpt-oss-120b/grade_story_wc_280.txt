<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ghost's motivation to mend the timeline through echoes is clear and intensifies via synesthetic yearning, with embodied emotions in colors and sounds driving micro-choices like singing; however, the shopkeeper's late introduction lacks depth, feeling more like a vessel than a crucible for relational pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through echoing images and sensory shards toward a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost in the ghost's peaceful dissipation; orientation anchors early in the theater, and one meaningful deepening aligns the timeline without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The mystic orchard and hedge maze are vividly specific, with glowing apples and humming branches constraining the ghost's ritual and charging the final image of falling fruit as applause; sensory details like cinnamon scents and violin sighs integrate purposefully through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mending the fractured timeline escalates via accumulating echoes that narrow options, culminating in a deepening cadence shift with visible cost in the ghost's essence expanding to peace; however, the shopkeeper's coincidental arrival slightly undercuts agency without fully resolving via coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of summoning hope from despair emerges organically through recurring echoes and the coin's shifting symbols, offering resonant ambiguity in the final sunrise image that reweights nostalgia without moralizing; subtext in synesthetic harmonies invites reflection on lost performances.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-POV from the ghost maintains stable distance with perceptual signature in synesthetic blends, like voice as "rusted brass and liquid violet"; prose texture is distinct and rhythmic, modulating with emotional intensity, though minimal dialogue is natural when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sensory cascades like "apples bursting into luminous notes" without loops or artifacts; figurative language coheres in peak beats, propelling momentum, but occasional overwriting in synesthetic stacks slightly muddles clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghostly encore with tarot-mended timelines and synesthetic orchards transforms familiar supernatural tropes through specific sensory ingenuity; the rising nostalgia tone heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in the charged final chime.</comment>
