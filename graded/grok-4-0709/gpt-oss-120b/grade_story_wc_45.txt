<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to redeem mistakes through bone setting is consistent and intensifies via her actions with the tooth, revealing embodied contradictions between skepticism and forgiveness in the repair scene. Interiority is concrete, with emotions like tingling hands and soft laughter showing flawed optimism without therapy-speak. The final renunciation of doubt forecloses pure certainty with felt cost, as seen in her promise to the sky, though secondary characters are absent, limiting relationship crucibles.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images like constellations and clefts, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the repaired body and glowing tooth reweight doubt into hope with conceptual cost in the garden's exhale. Orientation anchors early in the garden behind the maze, avoiding penalties. However, causality feels elliptical, with the tooth's placement lacking a decisive causal chain, slightly weakening the before/after legibility at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The secret garden is vividly specific with midnight perfume, moss, roots, and hedges that pulse and rustle, constraining Mara's choices by providing the moss-cradled body and tooth. Sensory details like cold certainty in marrow and leaf glow are purposeful, mirroring her internal doubt, and the environment charges the final image of the glimmering garden. Spatial choreography tracks her kneeling and leaving coherently, with the hedge maze evolving to exhale upon exit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of resolving the cleft in certainty escalates through pattern intensification in the repair beat, with a meaningful deepening as vertebrae clicks narrow doubt. Cost is felt conceptually in the gateway metaphor, but pressure remains abstract without a clear on-page reversal or trade-off. The yearning action drives agency, yet coincidence in the tooth's presence complicates without resolving, keeping escalation functional but not tightly narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of redeeming mistakes into hope emerges organically from images like constellations and the tooth's glow, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the journal quote reweighting errors as dark matter. Subtext in gestures like whispering to roots invites reflection on skepticism without confusion. However, the final paragraph's explicit statement borders on moralizing, slightly undercutting ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Mara's shrewdly innocent eyes filtering wonders like the pulsing tooth. Prose texture is distinct with rhythmic, metaphorical syntax that modulates under pressure, as in the symphony of vertebrae clicks. Patterned elision in lyric mode is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "midnight perfume" and "embryonic galaxy," but occasional paraphrase loops, such as repeated "cleft in certainty" echoes, slightly dull momentum without obscuring closure. Rhythm varies naturally, with strong verbs and specific nouns propelling beats, though some metaphors like "stitching fractured destinies" feel mixed in the repair scene. No major artifacts touch the ending, maintaining propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes fantasy elements like the changeling tooth with themes of skeptical redemption in a fresh, non-obvious way, feeling inevitable through Mara's bone-setting innovation. Risk-taking in nostalgic innovation tone heightens stakes via metaphorical repair without gimmickry. Tropes of hidden gardens are transformed by personal constellations, creating memorable emotional specificity.</comment>
