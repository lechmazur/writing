<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to survey winds and cultivate foresight is clear and intensifies through her actions, rooted in consistent traits like adaptability; interiority is concrete with embodied details like measured breaths, though some emotions lean poetic rather than contradictory; the final renunciation of silence earns a felt cost in responsibility, as seen when she pockets the patch feeling its weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned observations and data points toward a resonant reconfiguration where the vortex releases with conceptual cost of lingering energy; orientation anchors early in the port city hush; closure lands on-page with the town's pulse returning, though causality feels more textural than tightly linked, with the sudden draft as a micro turn that reweights stakes without full before/after cost legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The port city labyrinth of containers is vividly specific, channeling winds that constrain Mara's movements and mirror her hazy precision; sensory details like echoing boots and whispering tunnels integrate into action, evolving causally as steel shifts; the environment charges the final image of swaying containers and hopeful shadows, though occupational depth is minimal beyond wind surveying.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding the convergence signals early and deepens through data accumulation under the textural lens, narrowing options toward the tower; one meaningful tightening occurs as patterns align, forcing her signal with felt cost in the vortex release; however, pressure remains abstract without a sharp reversal or trade-off, and coincidence in the draft complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of cultivating foresight amid silence emerges organically from Mara's mappings and the patch's recurrence, inviting reflection on unseen currents without tidy morals; subtext in ghostly gusts and the final sigh offers resonant ambiguity; the ending reweights the premise non-literally as the patch points to a new horizon, though some insights feel asserted rather than fully earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual bias in Mara's wind-focused noticing; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, hazy prose that modulates with intensity, like the anemometer's trembling needle; no dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; purposeful compression in poetic phrasing is taught early and pays off at closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density in metaphors like ghosts around metal walls, advancing atmosphere; rhythm varies naturally, but some paraphrase loops appear in wind descriptions, such as repeated shifts and murmurs; figurative language muddles slightly in peak beats without harming clarity, and final line resolves with strong image; minor scaffold in synonym churn like "hush" and "silence" deducts lightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise of post-storm wind surveying in a container labyrinth offers a fresh angle on adaptation and foresight, transforming investigative tropes through textural buildup; the patch as talisman synthesizes machine-airflow ideas organically, heightening stakes in the vortex release; risk in hazy, poetic style coheres without gimmickry, though emotional complexity stays mid-range.</comment>
