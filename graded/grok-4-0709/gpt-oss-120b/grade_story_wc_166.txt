<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to craft the cosmic verse is clear and rooted in her exile, intensifying through her dance to compel the etching choice with a felt reconfiguration of solitude into pilgrimage. Interiority is concrete via embodied movements like tracing lines on skin, but lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, trending toward summary rather than layered conflict. The final endurance of her transformed exile shows credible change with conceptual cost, though flaws like stock poetic phrasing slightly dilute specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, motifs of tides, gaps, and moonstone build density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where exile becomes a conduit, with conceptual cost legible in the dissolving distance and universal speech at closure. Orientation anchors who (Lira), where (twilight garden), and when (after nostalgia ban) by ~50 words, serving the lyric pattern without disorientation debt. One meaningful cadence shift at the etching tightens the stake, but minor redundant phrasing in passages like "obsidian grace" creates slight pattern loops without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The twilight garden under stars is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like moonlight as spilled ink and salt-scented shadows mirroring Lira's internal exile and anchoring her movements. Setting constrains choices, as the deepest pool supplies the moonstone speck essential for the verse, charging the final image where blossoms turn silver. Micro-setting of her skin as canvas evolves causally, integrating action without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of penning the cosmic verse signals early and deepens through observing gaps, narrowing options via solitude's patience, with one meaningful intensification at the etching where ink pulses like a heartbeat, reweighting exile under the Textural lens. Agency via renunciation of bustling ports forecloses paths with felt cost in dissolved isolation, but pressure remains somewhat abstract without sharper trade-offs. Coincidence of finding the speck complicates without resolving, fitting the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of exile as bridge to cosmic connection emerges organically from Lira's dance and verse-etching, resisting tidy morals through ambiguity in solitude's cost versus gain, inviting reflection on gaps as possibilities. Subtext in images like melting speck and pulsing ink offers resonant, non-literal answer to self-imposed distance, reweighting the premise without statement. Final image of dust on petals carries emotional aftereffect, avoiding sentimentality via concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable in close third-person, with perceptual signature biased toward tidal rhythms and garden sighs, modulating rhythm in steps as syllables without unmotivated shifts. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax like "moonlight fell like spilled ink," teaching patterned elision early and paying off at closure. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; minor register drift into elevated diction feels voice-motivated in lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose advances atmosphere through concise, multi-job sentences like "each step a syllable," with varied rhythm and high density in motif accumulation, but occasional paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "obsidian grace") dull momentum without obscuring closure. Figurative language is controlled, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the etching, though some stock metaphors like "stars winked" trend generic. No major artifacts touch the final image, preserving propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tide dancing with cosmic tattooing transforms exile trope through specific motifs like gap-observing and moonstone dust, feeling inevitable in Lira's pilgrimage reconfiguration. Risk in lyric structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise implications. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on nostalgia and art, anchored in verifiable details like cabochon speck.</comment>
