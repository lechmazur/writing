<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lena's motivation to unveil miracles through touch is rooted in her scentless life, showing embodied emotion via reverent fingers and imagined visions, but interiority leans abstract with therapy-speak like "mapping emotional terrain," diluting contradictory impulses in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through layered imagery to a Conceptual Repricing at the end where Lena reweights her sensory loss into resilience, with felt cost in her enduring flaw; orientation anchors early in the shop, but causality feels elliptical without a tighter pattern payoff, slightly softening closure legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The water clock shop and morning fog vividly filter perception, constraining Lena's actions through occluded views and mist, charging the final sunrise image; sensory details like ticking gears and brass bowl integrate purposefully, mirroring her emotional mapping without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake in unveiling miracles escalates via textural density of whispers and vibrations, deepening to a charged realization with conceptual cost of her scent loss; however, pressure remains meditative without a sharper tightening that narrows options, making escalation feel accumulative but not fully constraining.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of finding miracles in fragments emerges organically through images like the screw's threads as pathways, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the shop's pulse aligning with birth; subtext in silences and fog adds complexity, avoiding moralizing, though some abstractions like "love's first sigh" border on sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stays stable with perceptual signature in scentless meditation and tactile bias; voice texture shines in rhythmic, fog-filtered prose, teaching patterned elision early; whispered dialogue pursues humanizing goal with subtext, though minimal, it advances emotional arc without mechanics issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose density is high with purposeful metaphors like fog as filter, but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "ordinary miracles" and "emotional terrain" variations) and mixed metaphors (e.g., clock breathing sighs then glimmering tears) create minor scaffold drag, especially in the accumulative build to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of aromatherapy without smell and clock repair as emotional mapping transforms tropes of loss into a non-obvious meditation on resilience; risk in lyric density heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, though premise echoes familiar redemption arcs without bolder subversion.</comment>
