<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to prove strangers remember kindness is clear and rooted in her insomniac, hopeful traits, driving her persistent painting; interiority is concrete through embodied tiredness and reveries, with micro-choices like leaving notes revealing values. Jiro as secondary character applies pressure by validating her goal. However, internal conflict lacks strong contradictory impulses in scene, trending toward summary over simultaneity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, with patterns of moonlight and brushes building density toward closure; orientation anchors early in the rooftop greenhouse under the moon. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Mara persists in her acts with the conceptual cost of ongoing anonymity felt in the final sanctuary image. One meaningful cadence shift occurs when Jiro remembers kindness, reweighting the stake without full causal chains required under this lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse in a smog-choked city is vividly specific, with sensory details like saffron quiet and silver specks mirroring Mara's hope; it constrains choices by providing isolation and moonlight resources that charge the final image of sanctuary. Atmosphere evolves causally with the moon's phases, supporting theme without overt symbolism. Environment charges the closure by becoming a conduit for lost languages and kindness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rousing kindness through art tightens once via Jiro's memory, deepening the conceptual cost of Mara's endurance under the Accumulative/Textural lens; pressure coheres through accumulating images, with one meaningful shift narrowing anonymity's isolation. Agency is in Mara's renunciation of fame for quiet acts, but stakes remain somewhat abstract without visceral trade-offs. Coincidence of Jiro's pull complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of remembered kindness amid lost languages emerges organically from Mara's actions and Jiro's realization, with subtext in glowing scripts and notes inviting reflection on anonymity. Final image offers resonant, non-literal repricing of gratitude without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through tired eyes and smog's pulse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and biased toward Mara's perceptual signature of reveries and moonlight; voice has distinct lyrical texture with rhythmic control in phrases like "saffron quiet." No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets. Patterned elision in daydreams is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid images like "soot-stained glass lantern," but mixed metaphors (e.g., "breathed a saffron quiet" and "gentle tides coaxing") create minor muddle in peak beats, deducting under overwriting checks. Rhythm varies naturally, but some paraphrase loops like repeated "methodically hopeful" dull momentum without payoff. Information density is high, advancing atmosphere, though final line resolves cleanly by recharging motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of insomniac art, lost languages, and kindness in a smoggy greenhouse transforms tropes through specific moon-tipped brush and reveries; non-obvious angle on anonymity feels inevitable. Risk in lyrical accumulation heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Avoids derivative premises by grounding in character-driven ingenuity.</comment>
