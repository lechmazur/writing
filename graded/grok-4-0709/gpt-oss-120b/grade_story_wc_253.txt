<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to cultivate lightness in grief is clear and intensifies through her whittling, revealing internal contradictions via her empty yet charged expression and whispers to flowers. However, emotions feel abstract rather than embodied, with stock phrasing like "emotional void inside her expand" lacking contradictory impulses in scene. The final renunciation of pure joy for coexistence shows credible endurance with moral cost, but interiority relies on summary over simultaneous conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through patterned images of carving and narration to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final placement of baton and bouquet, reweighting the hush with conceptual cost of moral ambiguity. Orientation anchors early with the farmhouse and turbines by ~50 words. Closure lands on-page with felt transformation, though causality feels more textural than motivated ellipsis, slightly softening linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The farmhouse and turbines anchor vividly, with shadows constraining mood and mirroring indifference, charging the final image as they race across walls. Sensory details like humming blades and earth scent are selective and POV-filtered, evolving causally with Mara's actions. Micro-setting of table and objects guides choices without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of cultivating lightness amid mandated joy tightens through whittling's deepening narration, reweighting grief's cost in the final declaration, under Accumulative lens via cadence shift. One meaningful intensification suffices, but pressure feels internal and abstract, with no clear foreclosure of options beyond conceptual repricing. Moral calculus sharpens the peak, yet stakes remain somewhat visceral-light.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of art enabling grief-joy coexistence emerges organically from whittling and narration, culminating in resonant final image without moralizing. Subtext in whispers and shadows invites ambiguity, earning insight through struggle. Avoids tidy binaries, embracing complexity via moral grayness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual bias in Mara's empty narration, but diction drifts into elevated register like "morally ambiguous purpose" mismatched to her blank-faced state. Prose texture is distinct yet repetitive in rhythm, with purposeful compression in lyric mode taught early. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety but suffers paraphrase loops, like repeated "remade hush" and "carving lightness" without added pressure, dulling momentum in peak beats. Figurative density muddles in lines like "shavings fell like snow in a world that no longer remembered winter," mixing metaphors without payoff. Information density is high, but scaffold redundancies like multiple turbine descriptions obscure propulsion; final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dystopian mandate with performative whittling transforms trope of enforced emotion via specific art-as-resistance, feeling inevitable in Mara's quiet transformation. Emotional specificity in moral ambiguity avoids generics, with risk in lyric accumulative structure heightening stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle, though echoes familiar surveillance themes slightly hedge boldness.</comment>
