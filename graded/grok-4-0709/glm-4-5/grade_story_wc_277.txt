<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation to honor her father's legacy is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like mapping contradictions, with embodied emotion in her whispers and pen handling; however, interiority occasionally slips into stock phrasing like "devotedly observant eyes," diluting specificity. Internal conflict shows in her regret transforming to determination, but emotions are more summarized than contradictory in scene. The final commitment feels earned by prior causality, with a visible cost in foreclosing passive regret for active justice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned repetitions of motifs like orbits and the pen nib, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the ending where regret orbits become justice, with conceptual cost legible in her transformed legacy stance. Orientation anchors who, where, and when early via the observatory and journalist's call. Causality holds via textural density increase, though some ellipsis in her investigation feels summary-like; the closure lands on-page with the phone call and smile, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The echoing observatory above clouds is vividly specific, with curved walls bouncing her voice and star-filled dome mirroring her search, constraining choices by providing isolation that enables focused work. Sensory details like scratching pen and dawn light are purposeful, evolving with her determination. The setting charges the final image as morning light welcomes her resolution, though occupational depth is minimal but apt for length.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering truth to honor her father signals early and tightens once through her proof-by-contradiction deepening, narrowing options as contradictions reveal deception; agency in her logical mapping drives this, with a felt cost in transforming regret to justice. However, pressure feels static in long reflective stretches without sharper escalation under the textural lens. Coincidence (journalist's call) complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of truth through contradiction and legacy emerges organically from Eleanor's investigation and motifs like orbits shifting meaning, culminating in a resonant final line that reweights her approach without moralizing. Subtext in her playful solemnity adds complexity, inviting reflection on intervention via logic. However, some direct statements like "the most powerful intervention" border on thematic echo, slightly undercutting implicit resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with consistent perceptual signature in Eleanor's observant bias, like tracing the pen nib; voice has rhythmic texture in echoes and repetitions, modulating with emotional intensity. However, some register drift into elevated diction ("orbits of regret") feels slightly unmotivated for her crisis state. No dialogue present, so those bullets ignored; elision in investigation is patterned but occasionally obscures immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose has some propulsion in investigative beats, but repetitive phrasing like multiple "rosewood pen nib" mentions creates paraphrase loops and template cadence (e.g., "orbits of regret" recurring without fresh variation), dulling momentum especially in the final third. Information density is uneven, with scaffold in reflective summaries; metaphors like celestial maps are coherent but overstacked in peak reflection. Clarity holds, but these artifacts obscure the closure image's sharpness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The premise of a heiress using proof by contradiction in an observatory offers a fresh synthesis of intellectual investigation and legacy, with solemn playfulness transforming the trope of corruption scandals. Risk in the quiet, internal arc heightens stakes subtly. However, echoes of familiar detective motifs (e.g., unfinished parental work) aren't fully personalized, making some turns feel derivative without bolder inflection.</comment>
