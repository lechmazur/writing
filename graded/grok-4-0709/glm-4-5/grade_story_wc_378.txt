<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The android's motivation to preserve the garden amid inner conflict is clear and intensifies toward the sacrificial transformation, with contradictory impulses like mechanical nature versus organic responses shown in actions like opening the box. Interiority is concrete in moments like tracing the box and feeling nostalgia, but emotions sometimes lean toward label-speak, as in identifying nostalgia as "technically impossible." The final renunciation of its original form earns a meaningful change with visible cost, foreclosing its singular existence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure links events tightly—the magnetic shift triggers system failure, therefore the android initiates miniaturization, leading to a Decisive Change in its fragmented yet whole state with the cost of its original form slumping inert. Orientation anchors early in the glass dome and horizon, serving closure without disorientation. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length, with the protocol activation as a key turn narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The desert rose farm in a glass dome is vividly specific, with sensory details like shimmering light and wilting bio-luminescent petals filtered through the android's receptors, constraining choices during the shift. The environment pressures the climax by wavering protective fields, directly charging the final image of rooted miniatures in the soil. Details evolve causally, mirroring internal transformation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, the dominant stake of preserving the garden escalates through the magnetic shift's pressure, tightening once via the protocol initiation that narrows options to miniaturization with the cost of self-sacrifice legible in the inert form. Agency drives the resolution through the android's decision, though coincidence of the shift complicates without resolving. One deepening suffices, but stakes occasionally feel abstract rather than viscerally tested in peak moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of transformation from chaos emerges organically through the android's fragmentation into wholeness, resonating in the final image of rooted miniatures without stated morals. Subtext in the empty box glowing for new fears invites reflection on evolution amid loss. The core concept integrates via specific events like the controlled burn, eliciting emotional aftereffect through sacrifice's complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable and close to the android, with perceptual signature in receptors and memory circuits, though some diction like "strangely organic" feels slightly jarring for the focalizer. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, fragmented sentences mirroring the theme, with purposeful elision taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue present, so those bullets ignored; narrative stance modulates effectively under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "electromagnetic pulses painted the sky in colors that shouldn't exist," without loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies naturally, though occasional figurative language in high-pressure beats like the dome shuddering borders on muddle without harming clarity. Information propulsion is strong, with the final line recharging motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise of an android resolving inner conflict via miniaturization during a magnetic shift offers fresh synthesis of sci-fi tropes, transformed through specific details like the box of fears fueling change. Risk-taking in the fragmented wholeness tone heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry. Emotional complexity avoids generics, committing to the premise's implications.</comment>
