<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to graft onto community is clear and intensifies through her proposal and the search, with embodied yearning shown in her hollowness and the final dedication; however, secondary characters like Kael and Mira feel underdeveloped, with traits like "silent" or "sharp eyes" not fully pressuring choices. Internal conflict is concrete but could show more contradictory impulses in peak moments, such as during the treacherous climb. The group's hands on shoulders at the etching reveals a hierarchy of values with felt cost, elevating the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through shared exhaustion and revelations, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing at the sigil's discovery and etching, with legible cost in dissolved ache and unshed tears; orientation anchors early with Elara shaping reeds at the orchard. One meaningful cadence shift from isolation to radiant home is sufficient, though minor ellipsis in the search could tighten causality. The final dedication reweights belonging with undeniable warmth, charging the closure image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and shimmering crater vividly anchor the setting, with sensory details like luminescent fluid and obsidian outcrops constraining choices during the rappel and discovery; the environment charges the final image as the arbor pulses with crater light, mirroring kinship. Details evolve causally, such as the half-submerged path, and reflect POV bias in Elara's reed-focused perception. This micro-setting integration constrains tactics and elevates resonance, passing the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of belonging tightens through the shared search's deepening bonds and the sigil's revelation, with one meaningful intensification in collective realization forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative lens; cost is felt in past hurts revealed and ache dissolving. Agency drives the proposal and etching, foreclosing isolation with emotional price. Coincidence of the tag's appearance complicates but doesn't resolve, though stakes could narrow more viscerally in the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of belonging through kinship emerges organically from the search and sigil, with subtext in whispers and webs implying connection without direct statements; the final image of the pulsing arbor offers a resonant, non-literal answer reweighting solitude. Ambiguity lingers in the land's ancient pulse, inviting reflection. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality via concrete revelations of hurts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV on Elara is stable, with perceptual signature in reed-focused noticing and luminescent ache; voice texture is poetic and rhythmic, modulating with pressure in the search's exhaustion. Minimal dialogue feels natural and subtextual, like Elara's dedication speech pursuing unity. Some elision in group dynamics is taught through accumulative buildup, paying off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid images like "bleed it back in silent, spectral pulses," but occasional paraphrase loops, such as repeating yearning and ache, dull momentum in the opening; syntax varies purposefully, though figurative density in the crater description borders on muddle without harming closure. Information advances atmosphere and character, with clean mechanics. No major artifacts touch the etching climax, but minor scaffold in setup limits higher bands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fantasy elements like reed-sculpting and ancestral sigil transforms belonging trope through specific crater logic and group quest; risk in mythic whispers heightens stakes organically. Fresh angle on community via land's promise feels inevitable in the dedication. Avoids stock metaphors, though echoes of mythic discovery are familiar without full subversion.</comment>
