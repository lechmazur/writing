<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in artistic longing, intensifying through his kinship with the ghost, compelling him to play the composition; interiority is concrete in moments like feeling the "pull toward the space that existed in between," but some emotions lean toward abstract labels without full embodiment. The final endurance earns a credible change with felt cost in completing the unfinished aria. Weakness in lacking strong contradictory impulses mid-scene caps nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elision of water, light, and music toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final chord, with conceptual cost legible in the program's dissolution and peaceful hush; orientation anchors early in the flooded opera house. Causality holds via textural density increase, but minor ellipsis in ghost's appearance feels slightly unmotivated without stronger setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The flooded opera house with flickering lanterns is vivid and purposeful, constraining Elias's movement through ankle-deep water and charging the closure with shimmering reflections like stars; sensory details reflect POV bias, evolving causally as light brightens with the music. Environment directly shapes the final image's resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling the ghost's code tightens meaningfully through discovering and playing the water-damaged notation, deepening via the music's alien familiarity under Accumulative lens; agency in Elias's decision to disrupt the silence forecloses silence with conceptual cost in the program's loss. Stakes feel visceral but could narrow options more sharply at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of liminal spaces bridging life and death emerges organically from music as a wordless conversation, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in shifting stains and ghostly figure invites reflection on artistic transcendence. Emotional aftereffect lingers through the peaceful hush, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward musical and ethereal noticing, like the program's pulsing; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax that modulates with intensity. No dialogue present, so policy skips; purposeful compression in lyric mode teaches patterns early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "keys gleaming like pearls in the deep," but occasional paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "liminal threshold" and "wordless conversation") dull momentum slightly without payoff. Rhythm varies naturally, and clarity holds, but minor overwriting in peak beats with stacked metaphors touches closure faintly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of haunted opera with water-damaged musical code transforms ghost trope through Elias's artistic kinship, feeling inevitable in the program's dissolution; risk in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on unfinished performances, grounded in specific details.</comment>
