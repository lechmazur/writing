<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to discover wall dreams is clear and intensifies through discoveries, rooted in her perceptive traits, leading to an earned commitment with the burden as felt cost. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like trembling hands during development, but some stock phrasing like "heart quickened" slightly flattens contradiction under pressure. The single-POV focus shows micro-choices, such as extracting the negative, revealing value hierarchy without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered discoveries from passage to lab, with orientation anchored early in the ivy-veiled corridor post-climate shifts. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing via Elara's realization of wall dreams and legacy burden, with conceptual cost legible in the final commitment. One meaningful deepening occurs at the film development, reweighting knowledge without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage and submerged Old City are vividly specific, with sensory details like cold stone and rain patter filtered through Elara's perceptive POV, subtly mirroring her internal quest. Setting constrains choices, such as the hidden chamber enabling the find, and charges the final image of connection to predecessors. Micro-setting like the fireplace integrates into action without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering architectural memories tightens accumulatively through the diary and film discoveries, forcing stance crystallization on legacy's burden with conceptual cost. One meaningful deepening at developing the negative narrows options and reweights stakes under the textural lens. Pressure coheres but remains somewhat abstract, lacking a sharper on-page trade-off beyond the implied weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of preserved memories and legacy emerges organically from Elara's discoveries, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer via the wall dreams realization without moralizing. Subtext in images like charred pages and pristine film bridges sonic-visual history, inviting reflection on human imprints. Emotional aftereffect is concrete, avoiding sentimentality, though some direct statements like "what walls dream about" border on assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Elara's sensitivity to echoes and vibrations, modulating rhythm under pressure like the development scene. Prose texture is distinct with purposeful syntax, but minor register drifts into elevated diction, such as "exuberant greenery," feel slightly unmotivated. No dialogue present, so not evaluated; elision is minimal and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "ivy-veiled passage," but paraphrase loops appear in repetitive echo descriptions, such as multiple "resonances" mentions without added pressure. Rhythm varies naturally, though some template cadence in discovery beats, like "she carefully extracted," dulls propulsion slightly. No major artifacts obscure closure, and final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The echo cartographer premise offers fresh synthesis of sound mapping and legacy in a climate-shifted world, transforming exploration tropes through specific perceptual details and thematic depth. Risk in conceptual closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable via accumulated finds. Avoids derivatives, with emotional specificity in the burden avoiding generic arcs.</comment>
