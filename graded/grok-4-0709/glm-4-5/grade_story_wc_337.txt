<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's motivation to ground spirits through her silence-accumulating attribute is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in her own brokenness, leading to an earned subtle repair in the climax. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like trembling hands revealing contradictions under pressure. Jacob, as a secondary character, applies relevant pressure via his secret, shifting status dynamics as the net unravels. The final shift feels earned by prior causality with a felt cost in her vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elision of silence and light, with causality in knot-unraveling leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the profound stillness and spirits' grounding. Orientation anchors early in the prism sanctuary under starlight, with no disorientation debt. Closure lands on-page with conceptual cost in transformed unrest to peace, reweighting Elena's attribute as a gift. One meaningful deepening suffices, with the final unraveling as a charged image shaping the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary under starlight is vividly specific, with fractured rainbows and bending light constraining choices and charging the final mended-mask patterns on the floor. Sensory details are purposeful, filtered through Elena's POV, evolving causally as spirits settle like snowflakes. The micro-setting of the net and needle integrates into action, mirroring her internal fragmentation. This environment directly charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grounding spirits escalates texturally through accumulating hush and knot-unraveling, with one meaningful deepening as the net falls away, narrowing options and crystallizing Elena's stance. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, forcing agency in her conduit role with felt cost in Jacob's released secret and her partial mending. Coincidence is absent; the intensification reweights the stake effectively. Cost is unmistakable in the profound stillness and shifted burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of untangling bound spirits and secrets emerges organically from Elena's work, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in her ongoing brokenness. Subtext in silence accumulation and net patterns invites reflection on unfinished business without confusion. The final image of mended-mask patterns offers a resonant, non-literal answer to restoration, reweighting prior fragmentation. Emotional aftereffect is honest, avoiding sentimentality through concrete particulars like unshed tears.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Elena's bias toward silence and fractures, modulating rhythm under pressure like the needle's precision. Dialogue is sparse but natural, subtextual, and goal-driven, as in Jacob's cracking whisper advancing the secret. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, image-rich syntax, with no head-hopping or register drift. Elision of the unspoken secret is taught and paid off in the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like spirits settling as snowflakes, with varied rhythm and no significant loops or artifacts. Sentence propulsion accelerates in the unraveling beat, using strong verbs without overwriting. Minor figurative muddle in "approving fireflies" slightly clashes but doesn't obscure closure. Opening anchors voice effectively, and final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise of a silence-accumulating restorer unraveling a net to exhume spirits offers fresh synthesis of restoration and spectral unrest, feeling inevitable through her brokenness. Tropes like haunted sanctuary are transformed via specific prism light and attribute, with risk in lyric accumulation heightening stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generics, committing to the vision organically. One fresh inflection in the interlaced hush reconfigures the tone boldly.</comment>
