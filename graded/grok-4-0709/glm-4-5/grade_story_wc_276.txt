<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fisher's motivation to catch the goddess's echo is clear and intensifies through his patient actions, rooted in his unique attribute of transliterating emotions, which compels tangible choices like weaving the net. Interiority is concrete in moments like the "banked fire" in his chest, showing embodied longing without stock phrasing. However, internal conflicts feel more poetic than contradictory in scene, slightly limiting depth under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and patterns toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the capture, with conceptual cost legible in the altered constellations and fisher's transformation. Orientation anchors who (fisher), where (sound wave garden), and when (timeframe of broken patterns) by the first sentence, avoiding penalties. Closure lands on-page with the net securing the echo, reweighting the garden's resonance without mechanical explanation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vividly specific, with whispers blooming into ripples and thoughts as transparent flora, constraining choices like navigating auditory blooms and anchoring with the rail spike. Sensory details are purposeful, reflecting the fisher's perceptual bias toward silence amid vibration, and the setting evolves causally as it settles post-capture. A recurring object (rail spike) charges the final image by humming with the echo, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of catching the echo tightens through one meaningful deepening—the weaving of the emotional net amid stirring constellations—forcing agency in the final zigzag to secure it, coherent under the textural lens. Cost is felt in the subtle alteration of celestial paths and the fisher's changed self, though not viscerally dramatized. Coincidence (echo's descent) complicates without resolving, elevating the feral lullaby's pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of seeking understanding through silence and emotion emerges organically from images like voicing silence and the net of feelings, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the echo's lingering influence. The final image of the humming rail spike offers a resonant, non-literal answer to touching the divine, reweighting the premise without statement. Subtext in contradictions like "feral lullaby" enriches complexity without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable and close, with perceptual signature in selective noticing of sound waves and emotions, modulating rhythm from deliberate movements to the divine electricity. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax and patterned elision (e.g., paradoxical "voicing silence"), taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in sentences like "Each silent utterance rippled outward like rings in water," advancing atmosphere without loops. Some figurative density in the garden description borders on overwriting but pays off in the net-weaving beat, avoiding muddle. Clarity holds at closure with the humming rail spike, though minor synonym churn (e.g., repeated "patterns broke themselves") deducts slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes surreal elements like sleepwalking constellations and emotion-transliterating into a fresh angle on divine pursuit, feeling inevitable through the fisher's methodical chaos. Risk-taking in paradoxical methods (voicing silence, feral lullaby) heightens stakes organically without gimmickry, transforming tropes of fishing into profound understanding. The core concept commits fully, with the echo's capture offering non-obvious resonance.</comment>
