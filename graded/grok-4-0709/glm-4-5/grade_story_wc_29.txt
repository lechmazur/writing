<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in Elara's obsession, compelling her to interfere with the signals, but interiority relies on stock summaries like "sleep had become a luxury" without embodied contradictions in scene; the final hopeful expression feels earned through her actions, yet flaws like diagnostic labels in her thoughts weaken specificity under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure builds through motivated sequences from preparation to activation and resolution, with orientation anchored early in the radio station; closure lands as a Decisive Change when the signal blinks out, with felt cost in her terror and the risk of trickster return, though some ellipsis in community healing feels summary-led rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The university radio station is vividly anchored with humming equipment and charts, constraining Elara's choices by providing tools for interference; sensory details like crackling air and pulsing light integrate into action, charging the climax, but some descriptions repeat generically without evolving to mirror her internal state more deeply.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of outwitting tricksters escalates causally through her risky activation, tightening options with potential equipment rupture and attracting attention; one meaningful deepening occurs as frequencies stabilize and silence falls, with visible cost in vibrating air and her held breath, but pressure feels abstract in the over-week summary without on-page tests.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of manipulation versus human agency emerges organically from events like signal interference reweighting community divisions, culminating in a resonant final image of awakening without moralizing; subtext in back-channel discoveries adds complexity, but some direct statements like "cosmic power struggle" border on thematic echo, reducing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual bias in Elara's signal obsession, and prose texture uses rhythmic descriptions like "air crackled with energy"; no dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets, but occasional filter verbs like "Elara knew" dull immediacy in peak moments without voice motivation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose has some propulsion with varying rhythms, but paraphrase loops like repeated "signals" and "tricksters" in adjacent lines create redundancy, especially in the setup; information density is uneven with scaffold summaries in backstory, and mixed metaphors like "invisible fingers" and "ethereal grit" muddle clarity without payoff in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise of cosmic tricksters manipulating via frequencies offers a fresh sci-fi angle on division, transformed through Elara's subsonic interference; ingenuity shines in the alignment chart reveal, feeling inevitable, but echoes familiar alien conspiracy tropes without bold risk-taking to subvert expectations fully.</comment>
