<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in personal loss, intensifying through his whisper ritual to a meaningful endurance that forecloses doubt with emotional cost; interiority is concrete with embodied longing, but the sister's brief POV shift dilutes focus without adding contradictory impulses in his key beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern of mystical buildup to a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise, where the returning vibration reweights Elias's stance with felt connection cost; orientation anchors early in the lighthouse at dawn, and the sister shard transition is legible under mosaic allowance, though causality is more textural than strict linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse at dawn anchors vividly with purposeful sensory details like peach-lavender horizon and jasmine scent, constraining Elias's ritual and charging the final image of quiet sunrise; micro-setting of the vial and garden evolves causally, mirroring internal hope without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving whispers over shouts tightens through the ritual's deepening vibration, forcing stance crystallization with emotional cost of tears; under Accumulative lens, cadence shift at the return pulse reweights options, but coincidence of the sister's response complicates without fully complicating agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of gentle power bridging distances emerges organically from ritual images and the vial's purification, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the final jasmine-connection image that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in whispers vs shouts invites reflection on intent's subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV on Elias is stable with perceptual bias toward mystical vibrations, shifting cleanly to sister's shard via section-like break under multi-POV allowance; voice has rhythmic texture in descriptive passages, like "screaming tenderness," with dialogue natural and subtextual in the captain's softened curiosity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in dawn descriptions and ritual beats without loops; figurative language like "vibrations that would seek her" propels atmosphere cleanly, though minor synonym churn in "pure intent" repetitions slightly dulls momentum in the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of maritime mysticism and emotional vibrations transforms familiar lost-sibling trope through the vial cork's specific mechanics, feeling inevitable in the ritual's tender intensity; risk in multi-shard structure heightens resonance without gimmickry, though premise echoes magical realism standards.</comment>
