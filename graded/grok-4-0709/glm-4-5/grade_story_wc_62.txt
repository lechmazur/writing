<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to honor collective grief is clear and intensifies through meditative carving and family rituals, culminating in the ambitious monument; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like pressing his thumb on letters revealing contradictory impulses of emptiness and overflow. The spectral mentor applies secondary pressure, though relationships feel more spectral than crucible-like. Flaws complicate choices without artificial balance, but some reflections border on diagnostic self-awareness mid-process.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned motifs like ribbon knots and butterfly migrations, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the monument reweights grief with undeniable conceptual cost in the depleted ribbon and transformed understanding. Orientation anchors early in the greenhouse workbench scene. Causality holds via textural density increase, with one meaningful cadence shift at the monument's completion charging the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse at dusk is vividly anchored with rattling panes, dim light, and dancing dust motes, selectively filtered through Elias's craft-focused POV; it constrains choices by serving as sanctuary and migration hub, charging the final image of the monument bathed in dusk light. Sensory details evolve with events, mirroring internal calm amid thunder. Micro-setting like the workbench integrates into action without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering collective grief's shape signals early and deepens through migration season's pressure, with one meaningful tightening as Elias retraces paths, narrowing options toward the monument; cost is legible in the depleted ribbon and felt transformation. Under Accumulative lens, pattern breaks like clustered butterflies reweight stakes without coincidence resolving. Agency via renunciation of individual focus earns the reconfiguration, though internal conflict could interweave more externally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of collective grief's transformation emerges organically from motifs like butterflies and ribbon, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer in the mentor's final words and monument's power, inviting reflection on shared strength without tidy morals. Subtext in silences and images, like thunderous calm, enriches complexity. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars, avoiding sentimentality, though some direct statements like "what we carry together" border on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature biased toward meditative details like vine patterns; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, purposeful syntax that modulates with intensity, teaching patterned elision in reflections. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets. Psychic distance shifts intentionally serve emotional beats, with no head-hopping or register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel momentum, as in the fluid dusk descriptions; no significant loops or artifacts, though some figurative language like "unsettled spirits" risks muddle but pays off in spectral theme. Clarity holds at closure with strong verbs and integrated details. Read-aloud flows naturally without template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravestone carving with butterfly migration and spectral mentorship transforms grief tropes through specific, grounded choices like ribbon-knot stanzas, feeling inevitable at the monument's reveal. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Avoids derivative premises by committing to thundering calm tone.</comment>
