<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elena's motivation shifts from duty to liberation through clear internal conflict, rooted in her archivist traits, culminating in the upload decision that forecloses her safe career with felt cost of impending punishment. Interiority is concrete but occasionally slips into stock phrasing like "heart raced," diluting embodiment. The final renunciation of her oath reveals a hierarchy of values, with her smile embodying contradictory triumph and acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure anchors orientation early in the Antarctic facility and builds through motivated ellipsis from discovery to upload, with closure as a Decisive Change repurposing her existence, carrying visible cost of Federation repercussions. One meaningful tightening occurs as she accesses networks, narrowing options. Minor redundancy in repetitive phrases like "echoing library under snow" slightly dilutes propulsion without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The echoing library under snow is vividly sensory and purposeful, constraining Elena's isolation and mirroring her internal thaw, with the cold floor in the final image charging closure. Details like thermal suit and amber-light integrate into action, reflecting her priorities. Recurring snow and quiet evolve causally, heightening atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth versus duty escalates causally through discovery and decision, with one meaningful tightening as she uploads, forcing stance crystallization and foreclosing loyalty with cost of potential suspension. Pressure coheres but remains somewhat abstract, with the letter's implications declared more than viscerally tested on-page. Coincidence of power fluctuation complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of controlled truth versus liberation emerges organically from Elena's arc and the letter's contents, with subtext in her whisper and final smile offering resonant ambiguity without moralizing. The ending reweights history's thaw non-literally, eliciting reflection on knowledge's freedom. Minor thematic echo in "knowledge cries out to be free" trends toward direct statement, slightly reducing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual bias in Elena's archival focus; voice texture uses rhythmic repetition like "dizzying quiet" purposefully for lyric effect, taught early and paid off at closure. Brief dialogue feels natural and subtextual, advancing her resolve. Minor register drift in elevated diction like "crystallized" clashes slightly with stress moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with varied rhythm, but repetitive stems like "the echoing library under snow" create paraphrase loops in multiple spots, dulling momentum without obscuring closure. Information density is high in action beats, with strong verbs, though figurative language stacks occasionally, as in the final paragraph's electricity metaphor. No major artifacts touch the upload climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise of cryogenic archival rebellion offers a fresh synthesis of sci-fi elements with personal stakes, transforming trope of hidden truths through Elena's specific choice to scandalize via dormant networks. Risk in her bold upload heightens stakes organically. However, echoes of familiar dystopian leaks feel somewhat derivative without bolder subversion.</comment>
