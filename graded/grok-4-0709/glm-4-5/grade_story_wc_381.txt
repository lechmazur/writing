<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The solitary summoner's motivation to hush the prophecy is clear but abstract, rooted in dreams without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; interiority relies on stock poetic phrasing like "quiet intensity" without showing simultaneous impulses. No second character, so relationship bullets are ignored, but the character's flaws don't complicate choices meaningfully. The ritual's transformation feels unearned, lacking a visible cost in the final release of the crane.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned descriptions and cadence shifts toward tranquility, with orientation anchored early by the brook and moonlight. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the crane floats away, reweighting the prophecy with conceptual cost of relief, but linkage feels declarative rather than motivated. No major causality breaks, but redundant sequencing like repeated brook references dilutes propulsion without deepening knowledge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven beside the quiet brook is vividly sensory, with moonlight and water rhythms mirroring the summoner's pulse, and details like stars reflecting integrate into the ritual's flow. Setting constrains the ritual's sanctuary but doesn't strongly pressure choices; the brook evolves causally as it carries the crane away, charging the final image. Repetitive anchors like "quiet brook" create rhythm but border on static.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of hushing the prophecy is signaled early, with one meaningful deepening as the wing absorbs the code, narrowing options under Accumulative/Textural lens. Pressure remains abstract and internal, lacking a visible cost or trade-off that alters tactics; the resolution via transformation feels coincidental rather than earned by agency. No reversal tests commitment, keeping conflict static.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting disruption into peace emerges from ritual images like the unfolding wing, with subtext in whispered secrets implying hidden costs, but it's overtly stated in lines like "disruptive energies soften into peace." The final crane's release offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing, inviting reflection on balance. Avoids sentimentality but lacks complexity in counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual bias toward silence and cosmic energies, but diction drifts into elevated, repetitive patterns like "terrestrially cosmic" that feel unmotivated for the summoner's voice. No dialogue, so those bullets are ignored; syntax varies little, creating monotony under pressure. Elision of prophecy details is patterned but not fully paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Prose suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence, like repeated "quiet brook" and "crane's origami wing" across sentences without advancing momentum, dulling the ritual's intensity. Information density is low due to redundancies, such as "flowed deliberately" echoing "flowing over smooth stones"; figurative language like "tranquil blaze" muddles without payoff. Clarity holds, but artifacts touch closure by obscuring the transformation's propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ritual with an origami wing offers a fresh inflection on summoner tropes through textural accumulation, but the premise echoes generic fantasy without non-obvious synthesis or risk-taking. Details like "terrestrially cosmic" feel ornamental rather than organic; the ending's reconfiguration arises from patterns but lacks bold transformation. Avoids close echoes but hedges in safety-middle abstraction.</comment>
