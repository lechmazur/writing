No head-hopping or unwarranted certainty; purposeful compression in cosmic whispers pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the opening's vivid loom against sky, advancing atmosphere without loops.
