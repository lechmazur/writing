<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elina's motivation to compile fragments is clear and intensifies through visions, revealing character under pressure via reactive insights; interiority is concrete but leans toward summary rather than embodied contradictions, as in the vision of the herald's sacrifice where emotions soften abstractly. Flaws complicate choices without strong simultaneous impulses, limiting depth, though the final endurance honors pain effectively. Quick test partially met with earned renunciation but lacks visible contradictory pulls in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with patterned visions building to a Conceptual Repricing closure, reweighting absences into presence with conceptual cost of overcome exile; structure deepens via staggered revelations, but causality feels elliptical without tighter linkages narrowing options. Orientation anchors early in the harbor after rain. Cost is legible in the final shared understanding, though more felt than visceral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting of ivory harbor after rain is vivid and purposeful, with glistening stones and briny scent filtering through Elina's bias to mirror absences; it constrains choices by providing objects like the chest and charges the final image of mingled spray and tears. Sensory details evolve with events, supporting tone without overt symbolism. Quick test met as the harbor environment reconfigures meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of heartening returnees through fragments tightens via visions under Accumulative lens, with one deepening in the diary revelation forcing stance crystallization; however, pressure remains low-stakes and abstract, lacking a visible cost or foreclosure that alters tactics palpably. Coincidence of objects complicates but doesn't resolve. Quick test unmet as agency feels observational rather than driving escalation with unmistakable cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of navigating absences emerges organically from visions and objects, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer reweighting exile as a chapter to write; subtext in fragments and tapestry avoids direct statements, inviting reflection through ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect is honest, embracing complexity without tidy morals. Quick test met with the ending repricing the harbor's emptiness into possibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward visionary insights; prose texture is lyrical and consistent, modulating with revelations. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation. Quick test met with distinct rhythm under pressure and no elision issues, though some diction feels elevated for the focalizer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with rhythmic variety, but paraphrase loops like repeated "absences" and "staggered intervals" dull momentum in reflective blocks; information density is high in visions, yet template cadence in sentences like "Through staggered intervals" triggers artifact penalty. Clarity holds, but overwriting in peak insights muddles propulsion. Quick test unmet due to loops in final third touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of visionary archivist navigating absences feels fresh through specific visions and harbor motif, transforming exile tropes with emotional complexity; however, premise echoes familiar healing narratives without bold risk-taking to heighten stakes. Quick test partially met with inevitable hindsight but limited ingenuity in structure.</comment>
