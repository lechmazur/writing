<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and rooted in dual allegiance, intensifying through orderly intuitive traits that compel mapping and resistance actions; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like clutching the stone chip under stress revealing values. Internal conflict shows contradictory impulses in scene, such as struggling between elders and entrepreneurs, earning the final renunciation of the earpiece with felt cost. Weakness lies in occasional stock phrasing like "revelation hit like a splash of cold water," which feels clichéd but doesn't derail pivotal choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure links discovery of encoded murals to mapping, organizing, and anonymous counterproposals via because/therefore progression, anchoring orientation early in the raft city setting. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration as Maya removes the earpiece and returns the chip, reweighting belonging with conceptual cost of ongoing vigilance legible in the final painted symbol. Strength in motivated ellipsis from revelation to flash mobs; minor weakness in summarized three-night mapping that skips some causal beats but doesn't obscure the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The floating raft city anchors vividly with sensory details like fried funnel cakes and saltwater, filtered through Maya's POV to reflect urgency in chaotic music and graffiti. Environment constrains choices, as murals across rafts enable encoded resistance and pressure the climax at the council meeting. Recurring foundation stone chip charges the final image by its return to the monument, reweighting collective power.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of navigating gentrification signals early via dual allegiance, tightening once through the revelation and mapping that narrows options to encoded resistance under Causal lens. Escalation builds coherent pressure from rumors to meetings, forcing stance crystallization in flash mobs with visible cost of desperation and sleepless nights. Strength in agency-driven deepening as Maya organizes via graffiti; weakness in coincidence of the junior council member understanding without prior setup, complicating but not resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of bridging divisions through encoded wisdom emerges organically from graffiti as resistance tool, inviting reflection on adaptation without loss via ambiguity in partial victory. Subtext in symbols like fish in constellations reweights cultural preservation, culminating in a resonant final image of the spiral symbol without stated moral. Strength in emotional aftereffect of hopeful defiance; minor weakness in overt statements like "the water remembers" that border on thematic echo but arise from scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable, with perceptual signature in Maya's orderly tracing of patterns and biased noticing of chaos. Voice texture is distinct in rhythmic syntax blending introspection and action, like "signs and symbols" mutter under stress. Limited dialogue feels natural and subtextual, as in the old-timer's observation advancing theme; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like neon constellations, but occasional paraphrase loops like repeated "encoded messages" in adjacent sentences dull momentum slightly. Rhythm varies naturally, with strong verbs and specific details propelling beats; weakness in minor scaffold like "not for the first time" hedge, but no artifacts touch closure. Figurative language is controlled without muddle in peak moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality in synthesizing graffiti as encoded resistance against gentrification on a floating carnival, transforming trope of cultural preservation through specific, non-obvious details like earpiece removal and stone chip return. Risk-taking in accumulative visual dialogue heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry. Strength in fresh angle on adaptation; no close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
