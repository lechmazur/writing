<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to guide humanity using ancient wisdom is clear and intensifies through her prophetic discovery, with internal conflict shown in her worry about misleading predictions; however, emotions like "shadowed elation" feel somewhat abstract rather than fully embodied. The contradictory impulses of joy and uncertainty act simultaneously in her preparation ritual, earning credit under the lens. A key moment is her laughter bubbling up unexpectedly, revealing character under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through patterned routines and intuitive observations to a Charged Poise closure where Elara embraces her role with the felt cost of responsibility; orientation anchors early with Elara atop the lighthouse. However, causality feels loose, with events accumulating via description rather than tight linkages, slightly weakening the pattern break at dawn. The prophetic comet moment stands out as a strong textural shift that reweights her knowledge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse under stars is vividly specific, with sensory details like swirling nebulas and aurora energy integrated into action; it constrains Elara's choices by providing manuscripts and beam mechanisms that charge the final image of guiding fleets. Atmosphere supports the tone of shadowed elation without overt symbolism. A pivotal line is the beam painting paths on water, where setting directly affects outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><grade>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of guiding refugees escalates through density increase in her laughter and prophetic intuition, with one meaningful deepening at the comet sighting that reweights her ability's cost as uncertainty. Agency is in her endurance and beam adjustments, foreclosing doubt with felt responsibility. However, pressure remains somewhat abstract, lacking a sharper trade-off in the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of rediscovering ancient wisdom post-information collapse emerges organically from Elara's routine and manuscripts, with subtext in her laughter implying intuitive paths amid chaos; the final image of guiding under unchanged skies offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is honest, avoiding sentimentality. The motivation whisper "We'll guide them" subtly ties theme to action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual bias in Elara's intuitive observations; voice has distinct rhythmic texture in descriptive passages, though some sentences drift into elevated register. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; elision in her prophetic calls is purposeful and paid off at dawn. The line "her words lost to the wind" exemplifies controlled focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise with good momentum, varying rhythm in ritual descriptions, but features paraphrase loops like repeated "shadowed elation" and dense figurative language in peak beats without full payoff, triggering minor artifact penalties. Information density is high, with lines multitasking atmosphere and advancement. The overwritten horizon storm metaphor slightly muddles clarity, but propulsion holds through the ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise ingeniously synthesizes sci-fi lighthouse guidance with prophetic intuition in a post-print world, transforming tropes through Elara's laughter and ancient shadows; risk in blending tech and mysticism heightens stakes organically. Freshness shines in the accidental prophecy at dawn, feeling inevitable in hindsight. No close echoes of familiar scenes, with authenticity in the singular vision.</comment>
