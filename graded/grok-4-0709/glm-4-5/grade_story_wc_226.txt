<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to refract truth through poetry is clear and rooted in her mischievous traits, intensifying to compel her climb and final poem; interiority is concrete but occasionally slips into stock epiphanies like "truth cannot be contained." Emotions are embodied in her whispers and smiles under pressure, with micro-choices like gathering disenchanted revealing values, though flaws complicate choices without full contradictory impulses in scene. The resolution accepts cost via Earned Stasis, but single-POV limits relationship crucibles.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building through echoed poetry to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Elara's words become infinite variations, reweighting truth with her potential sacrifice as felt cost on the page. Orientation anchors who (Elara), where (Canyon of Endless Echoes), and when (before ritual) by ~120 words. Structure fits two-shard scope with one transition from sessions to climb, advancing via textural pattern without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting of bone towers and echoing canyon is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like wind whistling and mist curling reflecting Elara's urgency; the environment constrains choices by amplifying her poetry into refracted echoes, directly charging the final image where the canyon transforms her words. Micro-setting of the pale spire mirrors internal defiance, evolving consistently to guide the thematic duel.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of defying singular truth escalates texturally as echoes grow louder toward ritual, with one meaningful deepening when Elara climbs for her final poem, narrowing options amid overseers' pressure. Cost is legible in her peace with sacrifice, but agency leans toward endurance without a sharp reversal; under Accumulative lens, cadence shift reweights stakes adequately but lacks a second intensification for higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of truth's multiplicity emerges organically from poetry refracting into echoes, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in silences and implications, like mist as listening spirits, invites reflection on absolutism's cost. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through Elara's quiet defiance, though some direct statements like "truth cannot be contained" border on assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Consistent third-person close POV with stable distance, perceptual signature biased toward artistic rebellion in noticing the spire as a challenge; voice has distinct poetic texture in syntax and rhythm, modulating with intensity. Dialogue is natural and subtextual, advancing plot via recitations, but some elision feels untaught. No head-hopping, though elevated diction occasionally drifts from character lexicon under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid images like "towers of bone reached toward a perpetually twilight sky," varying rhythm purposefully; however, paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "refract" variations) and template cadence in echo descriptions deduct for momentum drag, especially in the final third. Clarity is maintained, but figurative density in peak beats muddles without full payoff, applying -0.6 artifact penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy setting with poetic defiance transforms tropes of rebellion into a non-obvious angle on truth's refraction; ingenuity in echoes as literal and metaphorical liberation heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the climb and final whisper. Risk-taking in lyric structure elevates without gimmickry, though premise echoes familiar artist-vs-authority without bold subversion.</comment>
