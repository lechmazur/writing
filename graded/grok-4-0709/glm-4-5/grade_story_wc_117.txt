<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and rooted in her backstory with the locket, driving adaptive choices like using the eclipse for healing, but Lila remains somewhat one-note with traits shown more through summary than contradictory impulses in scene. Interiority is concrete and embodied, especially in the cautious exuberance during the eclipse, yet occasional therapy-speak like "resilience wasn't about strength but flexibility" edges toward diagnostic labels without full embodiment. The final hug and words earn a meaningful change with felt emotional cost, anchoring the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure builds through because/therefore linkages from Maya's planning to the eclipse breakthrough, with orientation anchored early in the activity room and ridge. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with Lila speaking, carrying visible emotional cost in the fragile whisper and tears, though the eclipse coincidence complicates without fully resolving. One meaningful tightening during the dimming sun narrows options and forces connection, holding the lens without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sage ridge setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like fragrance and windswept landscape filtering through Maya's POV to mirror healing themes. It constrains choices by providing the eclipse viewpoint and instruments, charging the final image where sunlight returns amid sagebrush. Micro-details like the locket and drum integrate into action, evolving causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of nurturing wonder in Lila signals early and tightens meaningfully during the eclipse drumming, driven by Maya's agency under the Causal lens with a visible emotional cost in the fragile breakthrough. Pressure coheres as internal (Maya's past) and external (eclipse) interweave, forcing stance crystallization without coincidence resolving it. One deepening suffices, but stakes occasionally feel abstract rather than viscerally layered with contradictory wants.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of ordinary magic emerges organically from music-eclipse connections and the locket motif, reweighting the premise in the final whisper without stated morals. Subtext in silences and gestures invites reflection on healing's complexity, earning resonance through the shared moment. The ending offers a non-literal answer to wonder's nurture, though some direct statements like "ordinary magic exists in the connections" border on assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV on Maya is stable with controlled focalization, perceptual signature in music-sage biases, and rhythmic prose modulating with eclipse tension. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and goal-driven, like Maya's whisper linking darkness to light, distinguishing voices without convergence. No head-hopping or unwarranted certainty, though brief elisions in backstory are taught and paid off in the locket touch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clear with varied rhythm and high density, advancing through images like "aromatic sentinels," but occasional paraphrase loops (e.g., repeating wonder's magic in reflections) and mixed metaphors (e.g., "symphony of healing" to "dreaming roots") dull momentum slightly without obscuring closure. Sentence propulsion accelerates in the eclipse beat, with strong verbs and concision, though minor scaffold in backstory summaries caps higher bands. No major artifacts touch the final image, preserving propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes music therapy and eclipse for a fresh angle on trauma healing, transforming tropes through specific details like the locket curl and sage rhythm. Risk in linking celestial event to emotional breakthrough heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in the drum taps. Lacks bold structural ingenuity, trending toward familiar arcs without close echoes.</comment>
