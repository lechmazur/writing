<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Arlo's motivation to understand clocks beyond mechanics is clear and rooted in his traits as a shepherd, intensifying through his backward counting experiment to compel a resonant shift in perception. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with emotions like quickened heart showing under pressure, though internal conflict could layer more contradictory impulses in the peak reversal moment. The final renunciation of conventional key use earns stasis with felt conceptual cost, foreclosing old habits. Quick test passed via earned choice, but minor stock phrasing in epiphanies limits to this band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images like reversing water and deepening silence, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where time's cyclical nature reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost in the final vow and wisdom-sharing. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by paragraph two without debt. One meaningful deepening via backward counting tightens the introspective stake sufficiently for length, though causality feels more textural than chained, with the ending's apprentice mention adding slight outline-like extension. Cost is legible in the whispered question and chain vow, passing proof test but with oblique emotional price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The horizon measurement station anchors spatially and thematically, constraining Arlo's choices through its isolation and tools, while the fjord quiet evolves from oppressive to companionate, charging the final image. Sensory details like brass fittings and refracting light are selective and POV-filtered, mirroring internal revelation without overt symbolism. Micro-setting of the clock's tubes pressures the reversal beat effectively. Environment charges closure via horizon pointing, passing quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding clocks signals early and deepens once through the backward counting, reweighting via textural pattern break in the reversing water, forcing stance crystallization on time's nature under Accumulative lens. Pressure coheres introspectively but escalates modestly, with one tightening narrowing options toward renunciation; cost is felt conceptually in the vow but could be more visceral. Agency in key insertion drives the shift, passing quick test, though lack of external opposition keeps it internal. Coincidence absent, but static conflict limits higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of time as lived experience versus measured commodity emerges organically from Arlo's experiment and images like cycling tides, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in clocks' "language of stillness." Subtext in silence layers and the final non-literal answer reweights the question via resonant reconfiguration, passing quick test. Epiphanies earn through specific reversal, eliciting honest aftereffect without sentimentality. Minor thematic echo in closing lines trends toward statement, but complexity lingers effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable and close, with perceptual signature in Arlo's clock-focused noticing and bias toward mechanisms; voice texture distinct in rhythmic, introspective syntax that modulates with pressure. Brief dialogue feels natural and subtextual, advancing insight in whispers and student talks. No head-hopping or elision issues; psychic distance serves emotional beats. Perceptual control under stress holds, passing quick test, but minor register drift in philosophical musings slightly mismatches calloused shepherd idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with good density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like reversing water without loops; rhythm varies naturally, though some repetitive stems like "Arlo [action]" appear in adjacent sentences without payoff. No major artifacts obscure closure, but figurative elements like layered silence occasionally muddle in peak beats. Information propulsion strong in reversal scene; final line recharges motifs effectively. Zero loops in closure allows this band, passing quick test with minor scaffold in backstory block.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Premise of hydraulic clock reversal for temporal insight offers fresh synthesis of steampunk elements with philosophical depth, transforming trope of time manipulation through specific shepherd worldview and fjord setting. Risk in textural, introspective structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable via patterned quiet. No derivative echoes; authenticity coheres as singular vision. Bold conceptual repricing elevates, passing quick test with +0.3 risk adjustment.</comment>
