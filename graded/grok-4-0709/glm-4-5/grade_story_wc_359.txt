<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eira's motivation to certify wonder is clear and rooted in her synesthetic traits, intensifying through her deliberate performance; interiority is concrete via embodied perceptions like crystallized breath, but emotions lean toward abstract labels like "responsibility felt heavier" without deeper contradictory impulses in scene. The final renunciation of ordinary existence earns stasis with visible cost in the crowd's tears, though flaws complicate choices more through description than on-page mistakes. Strong single-POV focus on micro-choices under pressure, such as translating hues to notes, reveals values with felt trade-offs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through layered sensory patterns of color and sound, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where silence becomes presence with conceptual cost in reshaped perception; orientation anchors early in the glacial cathedral. Closure lands on-page with the final chord merging colors into white light, reweighting wonder as essential without contradiction. One meaningful cadence shift from resonant peals to sculpted hush suffices, with persistent aurora constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ice cavern setting is vividly anchored with crystalline ceiling and subzero temperatures, filtering aurora hues to guide Eira's choices; sensory details like refracted light and echoing peals are purposeful, mirroring internal synesthesia without overt symbolism. Environment constrains and charges the final image, as the cavern oscillates and blossoms into hush. Tone tensions repose with elegance, evolving causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of certifying wonder signals early and deepens through performance, with one meaningful cadence shift narrowing to the final chord under Accumulative lens; agency in Eira's dance forecloses numbness, with felt cost in tears and legacy. Pressure coheres via aurora timing, but stakes remain somewhat abstract without visceral internal conflict. Moral calculus between beauty and deafness sharpens the peak, though no explicit loss alters tactics mid-way.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of wonder's essentiality emerges organically from synesthetic translation and sculpted hush, inviting reflection through ambiguity in silence as presence without tidy morals; final image offers resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting perception. Subtext in gestures like raising hands and glowing sheet enriches complexity. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality via concrete tears, tied to protagonist's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV on Eira is stable, with perceptual signature in synesthetic cascades biasing notice; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax modulating with intensity. No dialogue, so policy applies; purposeful compression in lyric mode teaches patterns early, paying off at closure. No head-hopping or elision issues, with narrative certainty matching her knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high density in multi-job sentences like indigo ripples as navy waves, but occasional overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., doves from confinement, lotus unfurling) muddles without payoff; rhythm varies, though some template cadence in "as she" phrases repeats. Clarity holds at closure, with no major artifacts obscuring; final line resolves by recharging the sheet motif. Minor scaffold in redundant elegance descriptions deducts, but propulsion advances atmosphere well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of synesthesia, aurora bells, and sculpted hush feels inevitable, transforming ritual tropes through specific glacial details and non-obvious wonder calculus; risk in lyric buildup heightens stakes without gimmickry. Premise offers fresh angle on perception, coherent as singular vision. One fresh inflection in hush as presence reweights ending.</comment>
