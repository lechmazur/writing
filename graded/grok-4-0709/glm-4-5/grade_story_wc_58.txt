<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The traveler's motivation to map healing geographies is clear and intensifies through embodied actions like tracing the weft thread, revealing contradictory impulses between avoidance and confrontation. Interiority is concrete, with emotions layered in sensory details like garden scents and starlight, avoiding stock phrasing. The final renunciation of his defensive projection feels earned, foreclosing emotional absence with a felt cost in the self-obituary. Minor therapy-speak in reflections slightly flattens peak ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through reflective shards anchored in the present garden scene, with one meaningful deepening via the self-obituary that reweights absences. Orientation anchors who (traveler), where (shadowed garden), and when (autumn after last ship) by ~50 words, serving closure without disorientation debt. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with undeniable emotional cost in confronting war losses, though backstory blocks occasionally risk flattening causal flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The autumn garden setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like dancing leaves and lingering perfumes filtering through the traveler's biased perception to mirror his internal decay and rebirth. Environmental elements constrain choices, as the lonesome majesty pressures his introspection, charging the final image of the gleaming thread under starlight. Micro-setting of the notebook and pen evolves causally, heightening thematic resonance without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><grade>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of understanding personal healing escalates through a cadence shift in writing his own obituary, reweighting the stake with felt cost of confronting absences. One meaningful deepening narrows options, forcing stance crystallization without coincidence. Agency via renunciation forecloses defensive projection, though internal pressure occasionally feels abstract rather than viscerally tested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of explained absences emerges organically from the traveler's profession and memories, culminating in a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration via the self-obituary that reweights healing without moralizing. Subtext in the weft thread's transformation from burden to compass invites reflection on loss and rebirth. Emotional aftereffect arises from concrete particulars like garden scents, embracing complexity without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward sensory introspection and rhythmic prose that modulates with emotional intensity, like faster pen movements in the climax. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; free indirect style is clean, avoiding filter verbs. Purposeful compression in reflections is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm through sensory immersion and syntactic flow, advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "thicker than the finest spider silk yet more fragile than spun sugar" is controlled, purpose-driven, and coherent, heightening propulsion in peak beats. No artifacts obscure closure, though one paraphrase loop in absence explanations slightly dulls momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise of writing obituaries for the living offers a fresh angle on grief and self-healing, transformed through specific details like the salvaged weft thread and projective presence. Risk-taking in reflective mode heightens stakes organically, synthesizing familiar loss tropes into a singular vision without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in the garden's lonesome splendor avoids generics, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
