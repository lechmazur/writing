<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to outwit cosmic tricksters is clear and intensifies through her cautious hope, driving high-stakes choices like recalibrating the dish; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in her fragile truth amid division. Emotions are embodied without therapy-speak, and her endurance forecloses paths with felt costs like sleep deprivation. The meaningful change in her hope blossoming is earned by causality, though secondary characters are absent, fitting the single-POV scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, the structure follows because/therefore linkages from signal detection to counter-transmission, with orientation anchored early in the office amid town division. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via the signal unraveling and peace earned, with visible costs like her gamble's weight and exhaustion on-page. One meaningful tightening suffices, but the plan's conception in a reflective block slightly softens causality without breaking it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The university radio station setting is vivid and purposeful, with the dish and charts constraining choices like recalibration; sensory details like the hum through shoes and grease-smudged hands reflect POV urgency. Atmosphere of organized chaos mirrors internal hope, and spatial choreography tracks coherently from office to roof. The recurring charts charge the final image by seeming like ancient history, elevating specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of outwitting tricksters to prevent division escalates causally through her plan and transmission, with one meaningful tightening when the signal unravels, narrowing options and raising costs like potential failure. Agency drives the resolution via her subsonic interference, with visible prices in exhaustion and gamble's weight. Coincidence is absent, and pressure coheres until stance crystallization at dawn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of subtle communication countering divisive power plays emerges organically from events like the counter-frequency inoculating the town, inviting reflection on hope amid threats without tidy morals. Subtext in images like the unraveling signal and blossoming hope resists binaries, with emotional aftereffect from her tired smile. The final image offers a resonant answer to cosmic trickery without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward astronomical details and cautious optimism; no dialogue present, so policy applies without penalty. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic metaphors like "ethereal grit," modulating with intensity. Focalization controls knowledge modestly, with no unwarranted certainty or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing through vivid images like ink-heavy charts and flickering lights, but occasional overwriting in stacked metaphors like tightrope over abyss slightly muddles peak beats without obscuring clarity. Rhythm varies naturally, and sentences propel momentum, though one paraphrase loop in the resolution ("the silence... a respite") draws minor drag. No major artifacts touch closure, and strategic telling compresses days effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise of subsonic counter to alien psychological warfare offers fresh synthesis on cosmic signals, transforming sci-fi tropes through Elara's grit and specific tactics like piggybacking on music. Risk-taking in quiet, whisper-based resolution heightens stakes organically without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generics, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
