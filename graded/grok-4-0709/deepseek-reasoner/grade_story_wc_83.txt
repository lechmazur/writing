<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is deeply rooted in her trauma, compelling her hunt with concrete interiority and embodied emotions, like the aching ruined eye symbolizing perception; the final renunciation of revenge for cosmic understanding earns stasis with felt cost. Internal conflict layers hope with bleakness, shown in contradictory impulses during the geode ritual. No stock phrasing; flaws like isolation drive inevitable solitude, charging the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through reflective shards to a Conceptual Repricing at the resonance from K-7B, with legible cost in her scoured soul; orientation anchors early in the observatory. Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise in the final line, reweighting her stance with undeniable pressure. Minor ellipsis in power cycle feels motivated but could tighten causality slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The floating observatory constrains choices via zero-g movements and power cycles, charging the final viewport gaze; sensory details like the hum's stutter and geode's coolness are POV-filtered and purposeful, mirroring her internal void. Micro-setting of the geode as tool evolves causally, enhancing atmosphere without excess. Environment pressures the hunt's timing, serving closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding unused potential tightens via the power outage, deepening to a resonant echo that crystallizes her stance under Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is felt in the bleak exhilaration and aching eye. One meaningful intensification suffices, driven by her agency in casting the psychic query. Coincidence of the outage complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of preserved potential amid loss emerges organically from the wedding memory and cosmic hunt, culminating in a non-literal Conceptual Repricing that reweights entropy with eddies of hope; subtext in the geode's cathedral heart invites reflection on survival's cost. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through bleak exhilaration. Final image resonates without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Elara's biased noticing of stars and memories; prose texture distinct via rhythmic, metaphor-rich syntax that modulates with silence. No dialogue, so policy skips; elision in reflections is patterned and pays off at awakening. Voice coheres singularly, heightening pressure without slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the silence's weight and geode's description; no loops or artifacts obscure closure, with strong verbs and specific imagery propelling momentum. Figurative language integrates seamlessly, as in perturbation metaphors, without muddle. Final line resolves with resonant image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi dowsing with trauma recovery transforms tropes through specific details like the geode's amethyst heart and perturbation theory; risk in lyric introspection heightens stakes organically. Core premise feels inevitable, committing to cosmic neutrality without hedging. Emotional specificity avoids generics, charging the hunt's ingenuity.</comment>
