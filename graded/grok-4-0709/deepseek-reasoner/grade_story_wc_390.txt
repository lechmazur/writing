<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to protect the artifact is clear and rooted in her grandfather's legacy, intensifying through embodied panic and precise calculations that compel her high-stakes tuning; interiority shows contradictory impulses like logical emotion driving her actions, with emotions embodied in her steady hands despite fear. The single-POV focus reveals character through micro-choices under pressure, such as cranking the key to engage the apparatus. Strength lies in the hierarchy of values evident in her adaptation over force, foreclosing physical confrontation with the felt cost of isolation. No major flaws, but some interior phrasing borders on stock, like "panic, cold and sharp."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, the structure follows clear because/therefore linkages from the ship's approach to Elara's sprint and tuning, culminating in an on-page Decisive Change where the sonic absolution neutralizes the threat with visible cost in her heaving chest and the marina's transformed peace. Orientation anchors who (Elara), where (drift-ice marina), and when (fleeting sunset) within the first sentence, serving the closure without debt. The single continuous scene fits scope, with one meaningful tightening as the thrum crescendos, narrowing options to vibrational matching.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is vividly specific with grinding floes and frost-rimed pylons, constraining choices like Elara's sprint down the creaking dock and integrating into action; the fleeting sunset mirrors transience, charging the final golden light in the closure image. Sensory details are purposeful, balancing sound (ice symphony, thrum) and visuals (gilded chaos) through POV bias, with the environment evolving causally as ice cracking turns to lapping water. Micro-setting of the lighthouse mechanism affects tactics directly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, the dominant stake of protecting the artifact escalates through the ship's approaching thrum, tightening options to one meaningful deepening via sonic absolution, driven by Elara's agency in tuning; cost is legible in her panic and the foreclosed path of physical fight, charging the final serene light. Pressure coheres, with internal fear weaving into external threat, and resolution earned by her adaptation without coincidence resolving it. Strength in the ethical calculus between conquest and balance, tested at the crescendo.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of protection through adaptive understanding emerges organically from Elara's logical emotional drive and the artifact's song, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the corporation's confusion; the final image of her as part of the song offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without statement. Subtext in the sunset's transience contrasts the permanent solution, inviting reflection on love's logic. Earned from specifics like vibrational matching, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Elara's engineer-biased noticing of frequencies and brass tactile feel; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, sensory prose that modulates with pressure, like shortening under the crescendo. No dialogue, so policy applies; elision of backstory is purposeful, anchored in the key and tilting present stance. Focalization controlled, with no unwarranted certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "frost-rimed pylons" and "mournful symphony," with syntactic variety accelerating in the sprint and tuning beats; rhythm varies naturally, passing read-aloud test. Minor overwriting in dense metaphors during the climax, like "fleshly ethereal effort," slightly muddles without harming clarity, but information propulsion remains strong. No major loops or artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing sonic absolution with an ice marina setting and logical emotional engineer, transforming trope of artifact protection through vibrational matching that feels inevitable; risk in the ethereal tone heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh angle on corporate extraction via sound waves, with emotional specificity avoiding generics. Core premise commits fully, with the key's reprise charging closure.</comment>
