Interiority is concrete, embodied in Elara's whispers and Kael's jolt, revealing contradictory impulses like his disdain versus reluctant acceptance.

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of convincing Kael to release resentment signals early, with meaningful deepening when the broken melody jolts him, narrowing options and forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative lens.

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of releasing resentment to embrace transformation emerges organically from the cylinder's fractured melody and shifting setting, inviting reflection through ambiguity in the broken song's grace. Subtext operates in gestures like Kael's flinch and Elara's soft refusal, eliciting emotional aftereffect without sentimentality. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting rigidity as the true pain, embracing complexity. Epiphanies are earned through the cellular memory jolt, tying arc to thematic question.</comment>
