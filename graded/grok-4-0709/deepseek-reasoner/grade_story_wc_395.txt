<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in her obsession with deleted files that drives her to risk her career; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like the "physical weight" of silence in the warehouse revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. The final choice to upload is earned by prior causality, foreclosing safety with felt cost. No second character on-page, so relationship bullets ignored; single flaw is slight stock phrasing in her "quiet obsession," but it doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages from noticing gaps to decoding numbers to physical discovery, culminating in a decisive change when Elara uploads the files, reconfiguring the archive's completeness with conceptual cost of truth's roar. Orientation anchors early in the server cavern; one meaningful tightening at the warehouse find shapes tactics. Persistent constraint of hidden data prices her choices, charging the final image of the patch in her palm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like the "humming cavern of servers" and derelict warehouse anchor atmosphere and constrain choices, with the safe's loose panel enabling the climax; sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's urgency, mirroring her internal absence. The patch as recurring object charges the final image. Minor slip in generic "silence as physical weight," but it supports tone without stalling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering deleted truth signals early and tightens causally when numbers lead to the warehouse, narrowing options and forcing agency in uploading despite career cost; one meaningful deepening at the log's revelation changes knowledge with visible price. Escalation driven by protagonist's choices under causal lens, with moral calculus between lie and honor sharpening the peak. Coincidence of finding the safe complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of nothing truly deleted emerges organically from events and recurring numbers, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where the archive feels "complete," reweighting the premise without stated moral; subtext in sensed absence invites reflection on honor's void. Final image of the patch offers non-literal answer to where deleted files go. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality through concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with distinct perceptual signature in Elara's bright attention to metadata ghosts; rhythmic control heightens pressure, as in the crackling log transmission, without elision issues. Prose texture purposeful and voice-motivated, modulating with intensity. No dialogue present, so ignored; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with vivid metaphors like "mausoleum of status updates" advancing atmosphere; syntactic variety supports rhythm, though minor template cadence in investigation beats ("she began... she saw... her search led") dulls slightly without obscuring closure. Zero major loops or artifacts in peak moments; final line resolves by recharging motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital archiving and corporate conspiracy transforms tropes through Elara's obsession, with non-obvious turn when numbers become coordinates; risk in bold upload heightens stakes organically. Core premise feels inevitable in hindsight via grounded details. Minor hedging in tidy resolution, but authenticity coheres.</comment>
