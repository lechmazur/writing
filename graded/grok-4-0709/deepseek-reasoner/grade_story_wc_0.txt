<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aris's motivation to quantify disaster is clear and intensifies through contradictory impulses, culminating in an earned renunciation of her sterile approach with felt emotional cost; interiority is concrete and embodied, as when she peels the wing with surprising tenderness, revealing values hierarchy without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through layered observations to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Aris reweights her worldview with undeniable humility cost; orientation anchors immediately in the greenhouse post-flood, and the persistent silt pattern constraint shapes her final insight without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse is vividly specific, with silt and drips constraining Aris's exploration and charging the final image of wing dust as transformative; sensory details like mud-sinking boots and gray film are POV-filtered and evolve causally, mirroring her internal shift without generic clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sterilizing grief escalates via textural density of discoveries, culminating in a cadence shift that reweights her approach under the lens; agency drives the deepening through her active observation, with unmistakable cost in humbled worldview, though one more explicit trade-off could sharpen peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of gradual transformation emerges organically from dust patterns and stellar analogies, resisting tidy morals with resonant ambiguity; the final image offers a non-literal repricing of decay as creative, reweighting prior sterility without assertion, eliciting honest aftereffect through particulars like the wing on her fingertip.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, filtering through scientific bias like modeling collisions; prose texture modulates rhythmically under emotional pressure, with no elision or head-hopping, and syntax reflects her analytical mind without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density and propulsion with varied rhythm, as in the drip-drip-drip integrating action and atmosphere; zero loops or artifacts, strong verbs like "waded" and "peeled" advance without muddle, and final line resolves by recharging dust motif cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astrophysics and lepidoptery transforms grief trope into inevitable insight via butterfly dust as artist; risk in lyric introspection heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise with authentic vision that avoids stock sentiment.</comment>
