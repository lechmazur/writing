<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to decode leaves is clear and intensifies compellingly toward the chaotic act of planting, with embodied emotions like "heart thrummed a wild, un-orderly rhythm" revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. The transformation from sorter to sower earns a meaningful change with felt cost in her "profound and terrifying clarity," foreclosing her orderly path. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, though flaws like self-deception could be more dramatized in micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned discoveries of leaves and monuments, culminating in a Decisive Change when she plunges the speck into the heartwood, reconfiguring the arbor with visible cost in her shift from order to chaos. Orientation anchors early in the ashen skyborne arbor during perpetual twilight, with no disorientation debt. Causality holds via accumulative illuminations leading to enactment, though the folklore reveal feels slightly elliptical without stronger motivational ellipsis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is vividly specific, with boughs cradling clouds and a workbench of living wood constraining Elara's choices and charging the final image of glowing core and new stars. Sensory details like mossy delight and falling leaves are purposeful, filtered through her sorter's bias, mirroring her internal shift from order to growth. Environment evolves causally, blooming with silver and gold veins, heightening atmosphere without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding prophecies tightens accumulatively through leaf illuminations, deepening to enactment with a meaningful cadence shift at the final leaf's image, narrowing options to sowing with felt cost in abandoning her meticulous life. Pressure coheres under the lens, forcing stance crystallization via the moonstone's discovery, though coincidence of finding it complicates without fully resolving. Agency in her frantic dance and plunging act earns the resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of prophecy as seed to sow emerges organically from leaf patterns and monuments, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights reading as planting without stated moral, inviting reflection on order versus faith. Subtext in tiny cairns for forgotten things deepens complexity, earning insight through her struggle. Avoids tidy morals, embracing ambiguity in her terrifying clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature in Elara's moss-stained fingers and leaf-focused bias, modulating rhythm under pressure like the "frantic, joyful dance." Prose texture is distinct and lyrical, teaching patterned elision in folklore metaphors that pay off at closure without opacity. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with rhythmic variety in sentences like "She was building one such monument... when her tool struck something hard and impossibly bright," advancing atmosphere without loops. Figurative language is controlled, avoiding muddle in peak beats, though some elevated diction like "cabochon dust speck" borders on register drift but fits the fantastical voice. Clarity holds with strong verbs and specific images, no artifacts dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of folklore and seed-sorting transforms familiar prophecy tropes into a fresh angle on enactment over interpretation, feeling inevitable in her plunging act. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, with memorable perspective in mossy delight and sky-sowing. Avoids derivatives, committing to premise with authentic vision.</comment>
