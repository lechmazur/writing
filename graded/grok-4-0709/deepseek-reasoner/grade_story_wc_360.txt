<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with emotional density building to a Conceptual Repricing closure, where understanding emotion as lived reweights the premise with undeniable sorrow; orientation anchors early in the topaz workshop; one meaningful cadence shift suffices, with cost legible in the final peace.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like crystalline walls humming with starlight anchor and pressure the scene; the topaz workshop and vanishing stars constrain the experiment and charge the final image of lucid peace; sensory hierarchy reflects Aris's mathematical bias effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of quantifying emotion tightens through the experiment's overload, forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative lens; one deepening via empathy waves narrows options with visible cost in drowning sensations; agency in pulling the lever earns the resolution without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
