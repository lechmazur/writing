<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Thorne's motivation to thresh meaning from cosmic noise is clear and intensifies through his doubt, compelling the key choice to use the pen; interiority is concrete with embodied contradictions like projecting conviction while drowning in doubt, shown in his handling of the pen during the signal decode. The final acceptance endures his flaw with felt cost, foreclosing hiding from error. No second character, so relationship bullets ignored; blind spots compound via the lichen mistake before reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through signal chaos to patterned message, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where failure gains purpose with emotional cost legible in his shiver of recognition and quiet acceptance. Orientation anchors who (Thorne), where (Graviton Station), and when (post-Kepler failure) by ~100 words. Closure lands on-page with cost, but lacks a persistent physical constraint shaping tactics beyond the pen's improbable fit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly setting is vivid and purposeful, with flickering lights and chaotic data mirroring Thorne's doubt and constraining his decoding; it evolves causally, smoothing into rhythm post-pen use, charging the final image of stabilized readings. Sensory details are selective, filtered through his physicist's bias, like humming silence and scrolling figures. No occupational depth required beyond anomaly pressure on choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of redeeming personal failure signals early and deepens via the message's theory, forcing stance crystallization under Situational pressure from the anomaly; one meaningful tightening occurs when the signal recontextualizes the lichen as key, with felt cost in eerie recognition. Escalation reads as density increase per Accumulative lens, but coincidence of the pen's fit complicates without fully resolving. Agency in using the pen forecloses despair with visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of finding purpose in error emerges organically from the signal's reconfiguration and pen's correction role, inviting reflection on doubt without tidy morals; subtext in the pen's uselessness turning key resonates non-literally at closure. Final image offers resonant answer to threshing meaning, reweighting failure without statement. Earned via specific struggle, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Thorne's pattern-seeking bias; voice texture distinct in rhythmic, introspective prose modulating with intensity, like heart hammering during decode. No dialogue, so ignored; purposeful compression in reflection anchors present with cues like pen-twirling. Distinct under pressure, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere via vivid phrases like "humming silence" and "ghost of his mistake"; rhythm varies naturally, but minor scaffold in reflective blocks slightly loops synonyms for doubt. No major artifacts touch closure; strong verbs and specifics propel, like "inserted the tapered, exotic nib." Information density high in signal decode beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi anomaly with personal redemption via mentor's contingency feels organic, transforming trope of failure through contingent lichen theory; risk in improbable pen fit heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on editing history, committed fully. Lacks bold structural risk for higher band.</comment>
