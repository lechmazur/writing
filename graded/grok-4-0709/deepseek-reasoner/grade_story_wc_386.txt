<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to salvage purity from wreckage is clear and intensifies through her intimate dream analysis, compelling her to absolve the ghost with a crafted resolution; interiority is concrete, embodied in her breath pluming and focused visions, revealing contradictory impulses between blunt truth and careful weaving. The ghost officer's shame and unfinished promise create authentic internal conflict, shown through his final act rather than summarized. Strengths shine in the climax where she exposes his heroism, earning the renunciation of his regret with felt cost. No major flaws, but secondary characters like the daughter feel slightly underdeveloped as off-page pressures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure flows with because/therefore linkages: analyzing dreams leads to the vision, uncovering truth motivates the dream-crafting, culminating in resonant reconfiguration where the ghost's intent is delivered, reweighting the globe's meaning with conceptual cost of unresolved loss made peaceful. Orientation anchors early in the glacier shrine, with deliberate disorientation in dream dives paying off at closure. The ending lands on-page with the candles flaring and warmth lifting, a decisive change charged by the father's promise fulfilled. Strength in the persistent constraint of the melted globe shaping tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The glacier shrine setting is vivid and purposeful, with cold as a living presence and ethereal glow constraining Elara's ritual, charging the final image as light becomes earned. Sensory details like breath pluming and humming air reflect POV urgency, mirroring her internal quest for tranquility. Micro-setting of the melted globe functions as a tool that constrains choices, evolving causally to anchor the resolution. No white-room issues; environment pressures the dream dive and warms in closure, heightening resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of granting peace escalates causally through dream analysis tightening to uncover the officer's heroism, narrowing options to craft resolution with felt cost of his unfinished promise. One meaningful deepening occurs when she exposes the truth, forcing stance crystallization without coincidence resolving it. Agency in her decision to weave the absolving dream drives the turn, with moral calculus between condemnation and absolution sharpening the peak. Strength in the climax's trade-off, but escalation could tighten more visibly in the daughter's dream sequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging purity from fragments emerges organically through Elara's method and the globe's transformation, resisting tidy morals by embracing the ghost's shame and love's cost without false equivalence. Subtext in borrowed light and unresolved moments invites reflection on loss and resolution, with the final image of starlight on waves offering a resonant, non-literal repricing of attachment. Emotional aftereffect arises from the father's "I made it," reweighting prior terror into peace. Strength in thematic complexity tied to character arc, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature selective to Elara's ghost-whispering bias, modulating rhythm from descriptive setup to compressed dream dives. Prose texture distinct in ethereal phrasing like "borrowed starlight," with purposeful compression in visions taught early and paid off at closure. Dialogue minimal but natural in the crafted dream, carrying subtext of resolution. Strength in consistent voice under pressure, no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and action like "fragments of dreams flickered behind her eyelids" without loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies naturally, syntactic variety supporting propulsion in dream sequences, though minor figurative muddle in "perfect, ruined metaphor" slightly clutters. No major artifacts; clarity strong, with final line recharging the globe motif effectively. Strength in information density during the vision of the ship's end, heightening momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Originality in blending wreck-diving with dream analysis for ghost resolution offers a fresh angle on redemption, transforming tropes through specific details like cameo signatures and the melted globe's evolving meaning. Risk-taking in lyric dream shards heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the father's shore appearance. Core premise synthesizes familiar elements non-obviously, with authenticity in Elara's careful truth-weaving. Strength in the non-obvious synthesis of spectral method and emotional truth, but could push bolder subversion.</comment>
