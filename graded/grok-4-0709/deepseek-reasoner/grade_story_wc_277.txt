<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation shifts compellingly from preservation to discovery, rooted in concrete interiority like the orbits of regret and the nib's changing weight, with embodied emotions in the "seismic shock" and final lightening; contradictory impulses act in scene, earning the confession with visible cost of dismantling her legacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through layered reflections and pattern breaks like the proof by contradiction, leading to resonant reconfiguration in the final writing act with felt cost of truth's hideousness; orientation anchors early in the observatory, and causality holds without breaks, though some ellipsis in digging feels slightly soft.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The echoing observatory above clouds constrains choices by isolating Elara and mirroring her introspective pressure, with tactile details like the telescope's gears and brasswork charging the final image of stars observing her act; micro-setting of the nib and archives integrates purposefully into action without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of family legacy vs. truth escalates through textural deepening in the discovery of the damning entry, narrowing options and forcing stance crystallization with legible cost in the "hideous" revelation; one meaningful tightening suffices, driven by agency, though coincidence in records feels minorly convenient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of corrosive integrity emerges organically from particulars like the nib and orbits, culminating in resonant non-literal answer via the confession that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in the telescope's clarity vs. varnished truth invites reflection, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in astronomical metaphors and rhythmic control under pressure, like the echoing dome whispering consequences; no dialogue present, so policy skips; elision in reflection anchors and tilts stance effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose density advances atmosphere and character through vivid, varied syntax like "orbits of regret" without loops, though minor figurative muddle in "solemn playfulness curdled" slightly drags; high propulsion in the digging sequence and clean mechanics support momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of heiress legacy with proof by contradiction transforms trope of family secrets through specific nib and observatory, heightening stakes organically; risk in introspective structure pays off without gimmickry, though premise echoes familiar journalistic downfall narratives.</comment>
