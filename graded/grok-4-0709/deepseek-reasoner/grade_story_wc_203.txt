<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Leo's motivation as a ghost-seeing technician is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like probing the ceiling, revealing character under pressure; however, internal conflict lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, with emotions more summarized than embodied in pivotal moments like the ghost's reveal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure flows with because/therefore linkages from dust analysis to hidden compartment discovery, culminating in an on-page Decisive Change when the mainspring activates and the ghost fades; orientation anchors early in the ticket office, and the felt cost of lifted burden charges the closure without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is vividly specific with dust patterns and posters constraining Leo's investigation, charging the final image of the ghost's palm on the sill; sensory details like industrial grease and popcorn smells filter through POV bias, subtly mirroring his burden without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering the ghost's secret tightens causally when Leo slots the mainspring, forcing a reconfiguration with felt cost in the ghost's peace; one meaningful deepening suffices, driven by agency, though the ethical calculus remains implicit without sharper competing harms.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths and unresolved burdens emerges organically from particulars like the ceiling compartment, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in the ghost's silent flashes invites reflection, avoiding tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Leo's technician-eye observations; prose texture modulates rhythm under pressure, like the whispered "Show me," with minimal dialogue feeling natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the dust as powdered sugar without loops or artifacts; strong verbs and specific details propel momentum, especially in the closure click and chime, free of overwriting in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elevator repair with ghost-seeing in a circus setting transforms tropes through specific details like the mainspring barrel, feeling inevitable at the chime; risk in the quiet, conceptual resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
