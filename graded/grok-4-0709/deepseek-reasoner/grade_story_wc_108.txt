<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Leo's motivation to prove vulnerability as power is clear and intensifies through embodied fear and micro-choices, like pushing down panic to decrypt the cast; interiority is concrete with contradictory impulses, such as trembling hands versus steady voice at closure. Strengths include flawed traits driving mistakes, like past reliance on Marcus, and emotional progression via self-deception rooted in erased identity. Minor slip in stock phobia labels without deeper embodiment in peak decryption beat slightly limits nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under causal lens, because/therefore linkages drive from discovery to decryption to confrontation, with orientation anchored in opening line via rusted library under stars. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration as Leo claims his future with felt cost of terror, visible in trembling certainty. One meaningful tightening suffices, but ellipsis in childhood memories feels motivated; strength in persistent fear constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting anchors early with vivid, purposeful details like corrugated iron roof and rotting books, filtered through Leo's urgency; environment constrains choices, as confined shelves trigger phobia during cast retrieval, charging the final image. Sensory selection reflects crisis, narrowing to starlight gleam and gravel crunch. Micro-setting of shell and cast functions as tools that evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Under causal lens, dominant stake of reclaiming identity escalates via decryption tightening that narrows options, forcing stance crystallization against Marcus; agency in renunciation of old self forecloses running with felt cost in trembling hands. One meaningful deepening suffices, with pressure coherent until charged poise at end. Minor abstract stakes in early betrayal declaration without immediate test slightly dilutes visceral feel.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability as power emerges organically from particulars like shell whispers and cast decryption, culminating in resonant final image that reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in gestures, like lifting shell despite phobia, invites reflection on erased self. Strength in complexity avoiding tidy morals, but some direct statements like "vulnerability is the power itself" border on assertion over implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature biased toward fear and adaptation, as in phobia-screaming confined space; prose texture distinct in rhythmic syntax modulating with intensity. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision in memories is taught and paid off at closure. Minor register drift in elevated phrases like "transformative betrayal" feels slightly unmotivated for Leo's stuntman voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing through images like whispering seashell, but occasional paraphrase loops, such as repeating betrayal's obliteration, dull momentum in opening. Rhythm varies naturally, with strong verbs and specific details propelling beats; no major artifacts touch closure, but mixed metaphors like "live wire" and "trembling certainty" create slight muddle in peak stress. Strength in final line recharging motifs without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Premise of phobia-ridden stunt double uncovering erased identity via seashell cipher offers fresh synthesis, transformed through specific decryption method and vulnerability theme; risk in bold conceptual repricing heightens stakes. Turns feel earned, but echoes familiar tropes like hidden witness without deeper subversion. Authenticity coheres, yet middle-ground hedging in moral ambiguity avoids bolder flaws.</comment>
