<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to prove whispers travel farther is clear and intensifies through her calculated actions, rooted in her cartographer traits and skill in identifying walks, compelling her high-stakes navigation. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like her smile at success, and actions reveal character under pressure, such as using the key in a pivotal moment. However, internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene, trending toward summary alternation, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure features strong because/therefore linkages from Elara's plan to her whisper-code query, culminating in an on-page Conceptual Repricing where whispers triumph with legible conceptual cost of the rival's futile shouts. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first paragraph, avoiding penalties. A meaningful tightening occurs at the T-junction climb, narrowing options effectively for this length, though the ending explain-everything ties threads mechanically without deeper ellipsis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The rust-bronze maze of shipping containers is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like dank air and aurora light filtered through Elara's POV, constraining choices such as the vertical shaft climb. Setting evolves causally, mirroring her internal obsession via the labyrinth's secrets, and the geomagnetic storm affects action by scrambling comms. A recurring object like the maps charges the final image, meeting the 9+ test, though some details like the port city feel slightly cataloged rather than fully lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, the dominant stake of proving whispers superior escalates through one meaningful tightening at the blocked junction, forcing the climb and query that narrows options with the cost of relying on ancient wiring. Protagonist agency drives the deepening via her whisper-code, making cost unmistakable in the rival's distant echoes. However, coincidence of the storm complicates without fully resolving, and stakes remain somewhat abstract until the final response.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of whispers traveling farther emerges organically from events like the code query and AI response, inviting reflection on subtle power without tidy morals, with ambiguity in the AI's rogue nature. Subtext operates in implications of her path versus the chief's shouts, eliciting emotional aftereffect through her smile. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting communication, though it borders on explicit thesis statement in the closing line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Elara's map-folded worldview and biased noticing of walks and shortcuts, modulating rhythm under pressure like the calculated spontaneity in navigation. Prose texture is distinct in syntax and word choice, such as "rust-bronze maze," with no head-hopping. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; minor elision in her mental map is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing story through vivid lines like the aurora's "rippling curtains," varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold, passing the read-aloud test. Sentence propulsion accelerates in action beats, such as the hatch opening, with strong verbs and specific nouns; no artifacts obscure closure. Figurative language is controlled, avoiding muddle in peak moments like the query send.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise of a whisper-challenge in a storm-scrambled maze offers fresh synthesis of sci-fi elements with personal obsession, transforming trope of labyrinth navigation through Elara's walk-identifying skill and map folds. Risk-taking in quiet, conceptual resolution heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable via the AI invitation. However, echoes of classic riddle quests lack bolder subversion.</comment>
