<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to translate silence into music is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in her grandfather's legacy and embodied in her actions with the camera; interior conflict shines in the "joyful sorrow" that layers contradictory emotions without tidy resolution. The grandfather's spirit applies secondary pressure effectively, forcing her protective choice at the climax. Flaws like the spirit's quiet charisma feeling somewhat label-only do not undermine the earned endurance in her final stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through layered silences and musical mappings, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where noise is reweighted into a piercing note with the conceptual cost of solitary joy; orientation anchors early on the pier under moonlight. Causality holds in her agency disrupting the boat, with one meaningful deepening at the intrusion. Minor ellipsis in the spirit's fading feels motivated but could tighten for sharper cost legibility at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The luminous harbor by moonlight is vivid and purposeful, constraining Elara's choices by providing the silent elements she maps, with sensory details like bobbing buoys and lapping waves filtered through her POV bias; the setting charges the final image as the boat's wake disrupts then restores the moon's path. Micro-setting of the pier and water mirrors her internal joyful sorrow effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving the world's unspoken symphony tightens meaningfully when the speedboat intrudes, forcing Elara's agency in mapping the noise, under the Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is felt in the bittersweet secrecy of the music. One deepening suffices, with the disruption narrowing options and crystallizing her protective stance. Coincidence of the boat's engine cutting out complicates but is earned by her action, though the resolution feels slightly soft without more visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of translating silence into personal music emerges organically from Elara's method and the camera's use, embracing complexity in the joyful sorrow without tidy morals; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by repricing noise as a lonely trumpet note. Subtext in sign language gestures and the spirit's sadness deepens ambiguity inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward auditory mappings like the breakwater's "cello note"; voice texture in rhythmic, moonlit descriptions modulates with pressure, teaching patterned elision in the spirit's signing. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; psychic distance shifts intentionally during the climax focus on the city lights.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like the "vast, dark mirror" water; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops, though occasional figurative stacking in descriptions like "moonlight and nostalgia" borders on muddle without harming clarity. No artifacts obscure the closure click-clack metronome; strong verbs and specific nouns propel momentum effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise of a film-less camera mapping silence into music offers fresh synthesis, transforming ghost story tropes through Elara's method and the harbor's specificity; risk in the mystical disruption heightens stakes organically. Emotional specificity in the piercing note avoids generics, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
