<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as an outcast rescuing a promise is clear and intensifies through her actions, with embodied emotions like "volcanic tenderness" showing contradictory impulses; internal conflict shines in the urge to burn the final tapestry versus choosing connection, earning the renunciation with visible cost in her "heart a volcano of hope and fear."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the mosaic structure builds through shards of arson, discovery, and weaving with legible transitions and a coherent Charged Poise closure where leaving the tapestry reconfigures isolation into connection; orientation anchors early in the library annex, and causality holds via motivated ellipsis, though minor redundancy in backstory summaries slightly flattens momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The archive setting pressures choices with its hidden slab and dusty shelves constraining Elara's surgical fire and crowbar use, charging the final image of the hills; sensory details like "cool and still" air and "smell of dust and time" are vivid and POV-filtered, mirroring her weary sigh, though some descriptions lean generic without fuller sensory balance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rescuing the promise tightens through the arson and weaving, culminating in a deepening that forecloses isolation with felt cost in her breaking smile; pressure accumulates texturally via pattern of liberations, with agency in her renunciation driving the Charged Poise, though coincidence in rumor accuracy slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of shared knowledge versus hoarding emerges organically from Elara's arc and the Kythian philosophy, with the final image offering a resonant, non-literal answer by repricing her vandalized self-portrait as part of a larger picture; subtext in woven clues invites reflection on connection, avoiding tidy morals with ambiguity in her hope and fear.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with clean focalization, perceptual signature in analytic intuition filtering details like the building's "aging bones"; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, image-rich syntax like "flames she set were precise, surgical," modulating with intensity, and no dialogue present avoids evaluation pitfalls.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like "She worked alone, after going off the grid," advancing atmosphere without loops; metaphors like "heart a volcano" are coherent and purposeful, with no artifacts obscuring closure, though minor synonym churn in "promise" repetitions trends hairline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Originality in transforming arson trope into cultural liberation via woven clues offers fresh synthesis, with risk in mosaic structure heightening stakes organically; emotional specificity in volcanic tenderness avoids generics, though premise echoes redemption arcs without bolder subversion.</comment>
