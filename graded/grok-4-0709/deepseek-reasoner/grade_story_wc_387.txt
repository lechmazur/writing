<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hideo's motivation to appreciate hidden effort is clear and intensifies through his ritual, culminating in the audacious demonstration without whistling; interiority is concrete, with embodied demure audacity in his heart swelling while sitting humbly. The headman's presence applies pressure, forcing a micro-choice that reveals values with felt cost in the headman's silenced complaints. Strengths include consistent flaws like Hideo's overlooked wisdom, shown through actions aligning with traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through ritual description to a pattern break in the fireflies' coalescing circle, providing Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost as the headman reweights Hideo's value; orientation anchors early in the parapet climb. Causality holds via motivated ellipsis in the fireflies' response, with one meaningful deepening in the confrontation. Minor slip in unkept setup of whistling's necessity, as climax omits it without breaking pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting of the whispering parapet after rain is vivid and purposeful, with mist and droplets constraining Hideo's somber ritual and charging the final image of the glowing net; sensory details like cool dampness and prismatic droplets reflect POV bias and evolve with events. Environment guides choice, as the high wall enables solitude and firefly emergence. Recurring elements like the damp stone integrate into action, mirroring internal appreciation of hidden patterns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of appreciating hidden effort escalates under Accumulative/Textural lens through the headman's confrontation, deepening via the firefly demonstration that reweights options with visible cost in the headman's stolen breath and forgotten complaints; one meaningful tightening suffices, driven by Hideo's agency in stirring the air. Pressure coheres, but stakes remain somewhat abstract without sharper internal contradiction. Moral calculus sharpens in choosing silent proof over defense.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of valuing overlooked effort emerges organically from Hideo's ritual and the firefly net, with subtext in gestures like stirring without whistling; final image offers resonant, non-literal repricing of "holes" versus mending. Avoids tidy morals, embracing complexity in demure audacity. Strength in emotional aftereffect through the headman's silent departure, but some direct statements like Hideo's explanation verge on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with distinct perceptual signature in Hideo's pattern-seeing bias; prose texture shines in rhythmic, purposeful syntax like "scintillatingly somber" air, modulating with intensity. Dialogue is natural, subtext-laden, advancing plot in the headman's complaint and Hideo's soft response. No head-hopping; patterned diction teaches lyric compression early, paying off at closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the fireflies' emergence; no loops or scaffold, with strong verbs and specific imagery advancing atmosphere, as in "a net of pure light." Figurative language is controlled, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the glowing circle. Minor hairline slip in one dense metaphor stack, but propulsion holds through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality in synthesizing net-mending with firefly patterns and tea whisk as ritual tool offers fresh angle on hidden effort; risk-taking in lyric ritual heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the swirling circle. Transforms tropes like wise elder through specific worldview. Minor derivative echo in philosopher archetype, but grounded details personalize it.</comment>
