<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation to understand living houses is clear and intensifies through discoveries, compelling her shift to participation with a felt conceptual cost in the ending; interiority is concrete via embodied reactions to objects, like the ringing void upon touching the hush shard, revealing contradictory impulses of curiosity and immersion without stock epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through layered discoveries with coherent pattern breaks, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Elara's participation reweights the house's silence as companionable love with undeniable conceptual cost; orientation anchors early in the new house by the bay, and causality holds via object-triggered visions without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting of the quiet bay and watchful house is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like salt-scented air and orange streetlight glow filtering through Elara's bias; the house's interior hush constrains her choices, charging the final image of companionable silence and directly shaping the closure's resonant poise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding living houses tightens through accumulative discoveries, deepening via the confluence vision that forces stance crystallization toward participation; under textural lens, cadence shifts reweight the stake with conceptual cost legible in her ritual addition, though internal pressure could embody more visceral trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of love animating houses emerges organically from object visions and Elara's shift, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the hushed blaze's lingering energy; final image offers resonant, non-literal repricing of the premise without statement, eliciting emotional aftereffect through her completed silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature in selective noticing of scents and silences, modulating rhythm under discoveries; prose texture is distinct and purposeful, with patterned elision in visions taught early and paid off at closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the streetlights daydreaming to propel atmosphere; no loops or artifacts obscure clarity, though some figurative density in peak visions borders overwriting without muddle, and final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of haunted house trope through love-infused objects and silence shards feels fresh and inevitable, with risk in textural visions heightening thematic stakes; core premise transforms familiar material via specific details like the orris root's scent, avoiding echoes without gimmickry.</comment>
