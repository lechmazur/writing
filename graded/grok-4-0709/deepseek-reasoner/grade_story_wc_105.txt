<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear and rooted in her grandfather's betrayal, intensifying through embodied synesthetic perceptions that compel her quest; interiority is concrete, with contradictory emotions like grief and hope layering realistically. The final renunciation of "fixing" everything earns stasis with felt cost in her tears and acceptance. No second character on-page, so relationship bullets ignored; synesthesia as a flaw complicates her hearing, driving micro-choices like pushing deeper despite pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with density building through layered images and reflections toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where Aris reweights her quest as witnessing rather than curing, with emotional cost legible in tears and the "terrible, beautiful weight." Orientation anchors early in the abyssal plain descent; one meaningful deepening at the vent eruption tightens pressure without multiple reversals needed. Backstory block fits BRR, cued by the greenhouse and tilting her stance via the imprint choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like the shattered glass domes and twisted trees mirror Aris's internal fracture, constraining her navigation and charging the final ascent; the geothermal vent as micro-setting evolves causally, its eruption enabling the capture and repricing the memory's impact. Sensory hierarchy reflects her synesthetic bias, with colors dominating under stress. Environment pressures choices, such as timing the collection during vent activity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of capturing the trust-breaking sound signals early and deepens via the vent eruption, narrowing options and forcing agency in activation; emotional cost is felt in the "devastating" color and tears, reweighting under Textural lens. One meaningful tightening suffices, with internal conflict weaving want (healing grandfather) and fear (reliving betrayal). No antagonist required; coincidence of vent timing complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of witnessing broken trust over fixing it emerges organically from images like the silent trees and sonic void, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in synesthetic colors implies emotional complexity, inviting reflection on memory's weight. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete grief; core concept integrates via the quest's reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with distinct perceptual signature in synesthetic "colors" like leaden gray, modulating rhythm under pressure without elision issues. Prose texture purposeful, with syntax reflecting her focused intensity; no dialogue present, so ignored. No head-hopping or register drift; uncertainty in outcome serves emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, with sentences like "tears mix with the cool condensation" advancing character and atmosphere; rhythmic variety breathes in reflective moments but accelerates at the eruption. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors like "shattering prism of obsidian and ice" muddles slightly but doesn't obscure closure; no loops or artifacts touch the final image. Clarity strong, with strong verbs and specific nouns dominating.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia, abyssal quest, and "sound of trust breaking" feels inevitable, transforming salvage-diver tropes through Aris's hearing-aid ingenuity and emotional specificity. Risk in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise implications. No derivative echoes; bold conceptual integrity in repricing memory as a "note in the song of a life."</comment>
