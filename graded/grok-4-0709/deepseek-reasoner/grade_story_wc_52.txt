<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to harvest lessons from loss is clear and intensifies through embodied grief, with contradictory impulses of pain and peace acting simultaneously in her carving; interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing, as seen in her handling of the gouge worn by her husband's callus. The final endurance forecloses despair with felt cost, integrated without therapy-speak. Relationships are absent, so those bullets are ignored per single-POV baseline.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned reflections and sensory details to a Conceptual Repricing closure where grief transmutes into foundation, with legible conceptual cost in the carving's shape; orientation anchors early in the loft with rain and kettle. One meaningful deepening suffices, but ambiguity in lens dominance at midpoint slightly caps per guardrail, though it holds at end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft is vivid and purposeful, with raindrops mirroring tears and constraining choices by providing a reflective space; sensory details like the kettle's rumble and wood's scent are POV-filtered and evolve, charging the final image of steam meeting rain. Environment constrains her method, qualifying micro-setting for 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of integrating grief tightens through carving beats, with one meaningful deepening as the form emerges, narrowing emotional options under Accumulative lens; agency in endurance forecloses loneliness with felt cost in the hollow space becoming foundation. Coincidence (rain) complicates but doesn't resolve; enters 8.5 with visible price charging the image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of love's transmutation emerges organically from carving and memories, with subtext in images like swirling tea leaves; final image offers resonant, non-literal answer to loss without moralizing, reweighting prior material per 9+ test. Avoids sentimentality through complexity, eliciting honest aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person POV with perceptual signature in selective noticing of wood and rain, modulated rhythm under emotional pressure; prose texture distinct in syntax and diction, teaching patterned elision in reflections. No dialogue, so those bullets ignored; elision pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel accumulation; metaphors like rust-hued peace are coherent without muddle, though some dense figuratives in peak carving beat slightly slow momentum without harming clarity. Zero loops or scaffolds; final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief as carving a feeling, transforming widow trope through specific ash wood and kettle timeframe; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight per 9+ test. Avoids derivatives, committing to premise with authentic vision.</comment>
