<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to uncover the sacred is consistently rooted in her trait as a noticer of creeping normality, intensifying through her handling of the bread and proposal for guerrilla gardening, which reveals contradictory impulses of mourning and resurrection with a felt cost of fragile hope. Anya's heuristically gentle nature applies secondary pressure, enabling the ritual without overshadowing Elara's arc. The final observation of the woman smelling the flower earns a resonant endurance, foreclosing pure loss. Interiority is embodied and particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of loss and revival, with orientation anchored early in the city's decay and Elara's discovery by ~100 words. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration in the tea house scene, reweighting the stake via the woman's uncommodified grace, with conceptual cost of tenuous absolution made undeniable in the final image. One meaningful cadence shift from crumbling bread to blooming flowers holds without contradiction, and persistent constraint of forgotten spaces shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard and secret tea house are vividly specific, with ivy and rose bushes constraining choices and supplying seeds that charge the guerrilla acts. Sensory details like brittle paper and fragrant dust are filtered through Elara's bias, mirroring her internal quest, and the environment evolves causally from hollow city to blooming pockets. The recurring bread object constrains the ritual and charges the final flower image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resurrecting the sacred escalates texturally through density increase in the ritual crumbling and planting, deepening via the shoots' defiance that reweights loss with hope, driven by Elara's agency in proposing guerrilla gardening. Cost is legible in the fragile forgiveness for forgetting, unmistakable in the pre-dawn deposits. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, one meaningful intensification suffices, with pressure forcing stance crystallization in the ending observation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of finding sacred in ordinary emerges organically from particulars like the petrified bread and guerrilla blooms, resisting tidy morals through ambiguity in tenuous absolution. Subtext in silences and the ghost bread invites reflection on loss without confusion. The final image of the woman kneeling offers a resonant, non-literal answer reweighting the premise, with emotional honesty avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward noticing decay and glimmer, as in the bread's surprising weight. Voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, lyric prose modulating with reverence, like whispering about milled flour. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances the plan without excess; no head-hopping or register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like gritty fragrant dust, varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, avoiding muddle in peak ritual beats. Minor overwriting in descriptive openings slightly dulls momentum, but closure image remains propelled and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise of resurrecting lost rituals via bread-seed guerrilla gardening offers fresh synthesis of urban decay and quiet defiance, transforming tropes through specific choices like crumbling a fossilized loaf. Risk in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the blooming shoots. Authenticity coheres in singular vision of sacred reclamation.</comment>
