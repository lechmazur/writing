<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to share light without fire is clear and intensifies through concrete interiority, with contradictory impulses of solitude versus sharing embodied in her polishing action. The final renunciation of isolation carries a felt cost, earning the endurance through prior reflection anchored by the grandmother's memory. No stock phrasing mars the character-particular emotions, and her flaws complicate the choice without artificial balance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through reflective patterns and imagery, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where Elara reweights her purpose with undeniable conceptual cost in the final illumination. Orientation anchors early in the coastal silt and grotto, with no disorientation debt. Closure lands on-page with the light explosion reconfiguring options, though one ellipsis in memory resurfacing feels slightly unmotivated without stronger cue.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto's mist and fissure constrain Elara's discovery, charging the final image as the aperture enables the light explosion. Sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, with the damp stone and zephyr bloom mirroring her unfolding peace. Micro-setting of the rock and glass integrates into action, guiding choice without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sharing non-consuming light escalates through textural deepening in the polishing beat, narrowing options and forcing a trade-off between solitude and generosity with legible emotional cost. Under Accumulative lens, the cadence shift at the light explosion crystallizes her stance without coincidence resolving it. Agency in angling the glass drives the intensification, though the pressure feels more internal than externally tested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of revelation through patient polishing emerges organically from sea glass imagery and grandmother's wisdom, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in solitude's cost. The final image of borrowed light as a cool fire offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration of sharing without consumption. Subtext in gestures like rubbing the glass deepens complexity without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature biased toward upward gazes and light motifs, modulating rhythm under pressure in the polishing meditation. Lyrical voice texture is distinct and purposeful, with syntactic variety breathing with emotional beats. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; no elision obscures clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density and propulsion with vivid, multi-job sentences like the light exploding into "a thousand green suns," varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the illumination. Clarity shines in concise, advancing lines, with zero artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of star-watching with sea glass polishing transforms familiar revelation tropes through specific grotto constraints and non-consuming light premise, feeling inevitable in the final reconfiguration. Risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry. No close echoes of famous scenes, though the motif risks symbolic convenience without fuller transformation.</comment>
