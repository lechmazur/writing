<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find the pre-decision moment is clear and rooted in regret, intensifying through embodied actions like wading and using the shard; interiority shows contradictory impulses in her pride and tears, with the closure renunciation earned by prior buildup. The apology's weight is embodied without therapy-speak, and her flaws complicate the choice authentically. Strength lies in the grotto scene where tears mark release, revealing value hierarchy with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through song-guided deepening to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the grotto, with Charged Poise via the condensation message reweighting regret; orientation anchors early in the mangrove edge. Closure lands on-page with emotional cost in tears and leaving letters, though one ellipsis in the journey feels slightly soft. The final image of the moon healing her skin charges the reconfiguration effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth is vivid and purposeful, with roots and water constraining Elara's path and mirroring her tangled regret; sensory details like silt and song are POV-filtered and evolve causally. The grotto arch charges the final image, constraining the ritual choice. Micro-setting of the leaf and shard integrates action seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of seeking the pre-choice space tightens through song persistence and grotto confrontation, deepening via the shard ritual to force stance crystallization; cost is felt in tears and foreclosed pride. Under Accumulative lens, cadence shift in the spirit's softened song reweights the apology with undeniable pressure. One meaningful intensification suffices, driven by Elara's agency in pressing the letter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of fierce tenderness in love beyond death emerges organically from spirits' song and Elara's regret, culminating in resonant release without moralizing; the condensation message offers a non-literal reconfiguration of forgiveness. Subtext in unsent letters and shard evokes complexity. Final image reweights pride's cost subtly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in mystical, textured noticing like "tea-dark water"; voice modulates rhythmically under pressure, with purposeful lyric compression taught early. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision in journey pays off at closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in sentences like the opening's tangled roots simile; no loops or artifacts obscure clarity, and metaphors like "fierce tenderness" cohere without muddle. Information density high, advancing atmosphere and character; final line resolves with resonant image. Peak beats maintain clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of medium's moonlight healing with mangrove spirits and condensation ritual transforms familiar quest tropes through specific emotional complexity; the shard's dual history of prayer and weather heightens ingenuity. Risk in lyric mysticism coheres without gimmickry, making the grotto revelation inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
