<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as a closure seeker is clear and intensifies through her journey, rooted in traits like accidental telepathy, but interiority relies on stock phrasing like "heart quickened" without embodied contradiction; the final renunciation of scars feels earned by prior fragments, yet lacks visible micro-choices under pressure that reveal value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images and echoes toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the cavern, with conceptual cost legible in fading scars; orientation anchors early in the tower, but causality feels elliptical with plant whispers driving turns without motivated ellipsis; the tunnel descent pays off disorientation functionally at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The quiet tower at dawn anchors atmosphere effectively, with sensory details like fogged glass and ivy hum filtered through Elara's bias; the tunnel and cavern evolve causally, constraining choices like descending stairs, but micro-setting like the hourglass charges the final image strongly, though some details repeat statically without mirroring internal shifts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of seeking closure tightens once through the tunnel descent under Accumulative/Textural lens, with deepening via memory fragments narrowing options; agency in reuniting hourglasses forecloses past wounds with felt cost, but pressure remains abstract without a clear reversal or trade-off, and coincidence of plant guidance complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of healing displaced miracles emerges organically from images like merging sand and fading scars, offering resonant ambiguity without tidy morals; subtext in plant whispers and coffee rings invites reflection, but epiphanies feel somewhat unearned, as in the cavern's light filling without dramatized struggle tying to the core question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable with controlled focalization, perceptual signature biased toward plant telepathy and warmth; prose texture in rhythmic whispers modulates with urgency, but no dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; elision in memory fragments is patterned and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose advances atmosphere with vivid images like "meteor hush," but paraphrase loops appear in plant whispers growing "louder" redundantly; information density is high in cavern climax, yet figurative muddle in "roots entwined with her resolve" obscures without payoff, and template cadence in descent echoes reduces propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes telepathy and displaced miracles freshly through plant-guided tunnel, transforming trope of forgotten self with specific ivy hum; emotional complexity in opening wounds avoids generics, but turns feel predictable, lacking bold risk that heightens stakes beyond symbolic reunion.</comment>
