<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to build intergenerational support is clear and intensifies through her actions, rooted in consistent traits like gentle persistence, but interiority relies on stock phrasing like "heart pounding" without deeper contradictory impulses in scene. Emotions are somewhat embodied, yet lack the raw, simultaneous contradictions under pressure, especially at the reveal to the widow. The final endurance feels earned with a felt cost of ongoing sanctions, but flaws feel one-note without complicating choices mid-story.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images like the bell and food runs toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the gathering, with a conceptual cost of redefined unity legible in the final image. Orientation anchors who, where, and when early via the arbor and exile context without debt. Causality is loose in the word-spreading beat, feeling more declarative than motivated, but the closure lands on-page with a cadence shift that reweights the stake of survival into thriving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor anchors the setting vividly, with wind and cracked tiles mirroring the community's fragility, and it constrains the gathering's choices by becoming a beacon that charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's POV, evolving causally from shadow to lantern-lit warmth. No major failures like white-room syndrome, but occupational depth is absent as not germane to the conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake of building unity escalates accumulatively through the reveal and gathering, with one meaningful deepening at the bell-ringing that crystallizes stance and forecloses isolation, under the Textural lens. Cost is felt in the persistent sanctions, but pressure feels static until the end without a sharper trade-off. Agency is in Mara's declaration, yet coincidence in word-spreading complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of hope amid exile emerges organically from the bell and donations, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights survival into familial thriving without moralizing. Subtext in anonymity and the bell's ring invites reflection on quiet defiance, but some symbolism like "amplified quiet" borders on overt. No thematic echo penalty as insights arise from events, though complexity is tidy without strong counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Mara's hopeful bias filtering details like the bell's tone; voice modulates rhythmically with pressure, accelerating in the reveal. Dialogue is natural and subtextual, advancing plot in the widow's exchange, with distinct idioms. No head-hopping or register mismatch, and elision in backstory is brief and cued.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise with good density, but occasional paraphrase loops like repeated "gently persistent" and metaphor muddle in "amplified quiet" dull momentum without payoff. Rhythm varies, yet some sentences overuse modifiers, as in "frail but sharp-eyed." No major artifacts touch closure, but template cadence in the gathering speech reduces propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise of anonymous aid in exile synthesizes familiar tropes into a fresh angle via the bell's symbolic persistence, but risks feel safe without bold subversion. Emotional specificity in Mara's peace elevates it, yet the arc echoes standard uplift narratives without non-obvious inflection. No derivative guardrail hit, as details personalize the archetype.</comment>
