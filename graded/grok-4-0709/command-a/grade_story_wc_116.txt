<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to witness change is clear and intensifies through her journey, with embodied interiority in gripping the swan and facing visions; internal conflict shows in her unease against judgment, earning the final acceptance with felt cost of impermanence. Strengths include concrete micro-choices like pressing the beak, revealing values under pressure. Minor weakness in somewhat stock mystical traits, but they align with her flaws without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through layered images and symbols leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration at the end, with conceptual cost in Lira's transformed understanding; orientation anchors early in the library. Causality holds via motivated ellipsis from swan to map to refuge, with one meaningful deepening in the mirror visions. Slight ambiguity in catacombs shifting, but it serves the textural pattern without breaking closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the overgrown library and obsidian refuge constraining choices and charging the final image of returned peace; sensory details like damp earth and echoing heartbeat filter through Lira's bias, mirroring her internal state. Micro-setting of the swan as recurring object evolves to guide action. Environment affects tactics, as roots frame the entrance like hands, heightening tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving balance tightens through the journey and visions, with one meaningful deepening in the mirror that reweights options via decay imagery; agency in following the map forecloses isolation with felt cost in unraveling mind. Pressure coheres texturally, building to stance crystallization. Coincidence of trembling swan complicates without resolving, but stakes feel somewhat abstract until the visions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence emerges organically from swan, visions, and refuge, with subtext in cryptic folds and crumbling peace inviting reflection on acceptance; final image offers resonant, non-literal repricing without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through quiet complexity. Strength in avoiding tidy morals, but some symbolism like the swan borders on overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature in Lira's story-shaped bias and rhythmic prose modulating with intensity, like swirling darkness; no dialogue, so policy applies. Patterned diction in lyric mode is taught early and pays off at closure. Distinct texture in syntax avoids monotony, heightening pressure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and concise imagery advancing atmosphere, like vines embracing tomes; no loops or artifacts obscure closure, though some figurative density in visions risks muddle but pays off. Strong verbs and specifics replace generics, with final line recharging motifs effectively. Minor scaffold in descriptive openers, but momentum holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mystical journey with origami map and regenerative silence feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like etched "Burrow"; risk in textural ambiguity heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional complexity avoids generics, but premise echoes familiar quest narratives with minimal subversion.</comment>
