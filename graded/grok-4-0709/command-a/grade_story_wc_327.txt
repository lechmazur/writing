<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation to save the language is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in ancestral loss, driving her to press on despite draining energy; interiority is concrete with embodied trembling and waning strength, but lacks deeper contradictory impulses in scene, as her determination remains one-note without simultaneous internal conflict at the climax where she feels power surge yet pushes to collapse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure holds with because/therefore linkages from entering the tunnel to humming and diamond shattering, leading to a Decisive Change in saving the language with legible cost of her exhaustion; orientation anchors who, where, and when in the first paragraph; strength lies in motivated progression, though the bird patterns feel like a minor unearned ellipsis at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The canyon and tunnel are vividly specific with luminescent moss and pulsing walls that integrate into action, constraining choices by providing echoes for her to harness; the setting charges the final image as towers soften and echoes still, mirroring her accomplishment; sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered, though some repetition of "echoes" borders on static.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of saving the language tightens meaningfully under Causal lens as echoes intensify and drain her, forcing agency in humming and speaking despite cost; one deepening narrows options with the diamond's curse exacting visible physical toll at climax, making cost unmistakable; strength in coherent pressure, but coincidence of birds mirroring her song slightly complicates without fully resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of cultural preservation through sacrifice emerges organically from her struggle and the diamond's shattering, with subtext in echoes forming words; the final image offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing, reweighting texture-to-sound as etched eternally; however, it borders on tidy resolution, lacking deeper ambiguity in her "unbroken spirit."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and modest, with perceptual signature in her focus on sounds and textures; voice has distinct rhythmic texture in murmuring echoes, modulating with intensity; no dialogue present, so policy skips; minor weakness in occasional filter verbs like "she felt" that slightly dull immediacy at peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose has high density with vivid metaphors like "towers of bone that rose like jagged teeth," advancing atmosphere and momentum; rhythm varies, but some paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "echoes" descriptions) and figurative density in the climax obscure propulsion slightly without muddling clarity; no major artifacts touch closure, but template cadence in action sequences deducts mildly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fantasy elements like copper veins and texture-to-sound translation feels organic and inevitable, transforming trope of cursed artifact through her sacrificial harnessing; risk in poetic, echo-driven structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; strength in fresh angle on language death, though bird patterns echo familiar nature-motif without bold subversion.</comment>
