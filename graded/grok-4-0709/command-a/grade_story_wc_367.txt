<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Herald's motivation to shape a new dawn is clear and intensifies through prophetic adjustments, culminating in a resonant endurance that forecloses isolation with felt awe; interiority is embodied in laughter shifts, revealing contradictory impulses like panic turning to curiosity. However, emotions occasionally lean toward stock elation without deeper contradiction under stress, as in the faltering laughter moment that resolves too tidily into awe.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through pattern breaks like the beam's pulse and fog's response, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the green dawn with conceptual cost of redefined purpose; orientation anchors early with the lighthouse and Herald. Causality holds via motivated ellipsis in wick adjustments aligning with winds, but the invisible hand steering the beam introduces minor coincidence that complicates without fully resolving pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse under stars is vividly specific, with the beam slicing like a sword and green glow mirroring the Herald's shadowed elation; setting constrains choices, as the lantern room's glass walls echo laughter and the fog bank pressures the climax. Sensory details are purposeful, evolving with events like rippling waves, charging the final gateway image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of guiding worlds escalates through a meaningful deepening when the beam veers, narrowing options and forcing agency in steering via reflection; under Accumulative/Textural lens, cadence shifts like pulsing light reweight cost with shadowed elation. However, the resolution relies partly on ancient plan coincidence, complicating but not fully earning the triumphant closure without sharper trade-off visibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of weaving past shadows into future dawns emerges organically from wick adjustments and gateway opening, with subtext in laughter's evolution implying bridged worlds; the final green dawn offers resonant, non-literal repricing of routine without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers meaningfully in ongoing work, avoiding tidy binaries, though epiphany feels slightly asserted in the "they understood" moment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in whimsical, prophetic interiority, like laughter echoing against glass; rhythmic control builds in short, pulsing sentences during the beam's sway. Elision of full mechanics is patterned and paid off at closure; beings' dialogue carries subtext of gratitude, advancing the reconfiguration without ventriloquism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like the beam as a sword; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the fog confrontation without loops. Minor scaffold in repetitive laughter descriptions dulls momentum slightly, as in the faltering then deepening echoes, but no artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse lore with otherworldly prophecy transforms tropes through specific wick mechanics and green dawn, feeling inevitable in the gateway reveal; risk in shadowed elation tone heightens stakes organically. Avoids stock fantasy by grounding in accidental prophecies shaping tactics.</comment>
