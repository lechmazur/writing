<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eli's motivation to prove whispers travel farther crystallizes effectively with Mira's encounter, showing embodied emotion and a micro-choice under pressure, but interiority relies on somewhat stock loneliness phrasing without deeper contradictory impulses in the climax. Mira's status dynamics apply pressure, yet her desperation feels label-only without altering Eli's hierarchy of values visibly. The final realization endures with conceptual cost, aligning motives, but lacks a blind spot compounding into a mistake.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure links finds to decisions with because/therefore progression, anchoring orientation by the first paragraph; closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with resonant reconfiguration of the labyrinth's meaning, carrying conceptual cost in the whispers' power. However, the map's self-unfolding and convenient lock appearance introduce minor coincidences that complicate without fully resolving via agency. One meaningful tightening at the blocked wall suffices for length, but the ending explains rather than dramatizes the truth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The port city labyrinth is vividly specific, with sensory details like salt, rust, and groaning containers filtering through Eli's POV to constrain navigation and mirror isolation; the geomagnetic storm evolves causally, pulsing through walls to heighten urgency and charge the final light. Micro-setting of the coin's warmth and key's weight integrates into action, but occupational details remain surface-level without deeper system depth affecting choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Under Causal lens, the dominant stake of proving subtlety over force tightens meaningfully at the wall challenge, narrowing options and forcing the key's use with felt hesitation; one deepening suffices, but cost feels more conceptual than visceral, with the storm complicating without fully resolving via coincidence. Agency in inserting the key crystallizes stance, yet stakes remain somewhat abstract until the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of whispers' subtle power emerges organically from events like the map's shifts and final realization, offering resonant ambiguity without moralizing; the ending reweights the premise non-literally through the light and whispers, eliciting emotional aftereffect. Subtext in Mira's taunt and Eli's hesitation deepens complexity, tied to the core concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual bias in walks and echoes; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic clangs, modulating with storm intensity. Dialogue in Mira's lines carries subtext and advances plot naturally, distinguishing her sharp idiom from Eli's interiority. Minor filter verbs in discovery beats dull immediacy slightly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with varied rhythm and strong verbs, advancing atmosphere through specifics like shimmering symbols; information density is high in storm pulses, but minor paraphrase loops in the ending realization (e.g., repeating whispers' power) dull propulsion. No major artifacts obscure closure, and syntax supports pressure without monotony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The labyrinth of shifting containers offers a fresh premise, transformed through Eli's gift and geomagnetic storm for ingenuity in navigation stakes; the whispers motif synthesizes organically, heightening theme without gimmickry. However, magical items echo familiar tropes without bold risk-taking to subvert them fully.</comment>
