<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation rooted in grief drives consistent micro-choices, like folding cranes and approaching the basilica, with embodied emotion in trembling hands and sinking knees; internal conflict shows contradictory impulses in crafting to escape versus acknowledging pain, earning the final renunciation with felt cost. Lira's secondary pressure as dream keeper forces his stance shift effectively. Minor slip in therapy-speak dialogue ("grief is not meant to be folded or polished") feels diagnostic rather than embodied, slightly undercutting interior specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images (cranes, lanterns, basilica light) with coherent orientation anchored early in the tea garden; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration via unfolding the crane delivers Conceptual Repricing of grief with felt cost in the subtle shift and genuine smile. One meaningful deepening at the altar tightens emotional pressure sufficiently for length. Minor elision in shadow detachment backstory anchors via present cue without excess, supporting causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating island tea garden anchors vividly with mist, paradoxical motion, and sensory details like rustling tea leaves, filtered through Kael's grief-biased perception; the basilica as recurring object constrains his choice to confront pain, charging the final image of rising island. Micro-setting of workbench and altar evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Strength in purposeful specificity, like dreamstone teardrop, heightens atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming grief escalates texturally through Lira's confrontation and basilica realization, deepening via one meaningful tightening at the altar that forecloses escape through craft and crystallizes acceptance with visible cost in unfolding the crane. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with agency in renunciation charging the ending. Coincidence of finding his own crane complicates without resolving, fitting scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of embracing grief over controlling it emerges organically from particulars like cranes and lanterns, culminating in resonant final image of crafting to honor pain without stated moral, reweighting prior motifs. Subtext in Lira's words and basilica whispers invites ambiguity on loss's nature. Emotional aftereffect honest via concrete realization, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stable with perceptual signature in Kael's craft-focused noticing, like calloused hands and gem polishing; voice texture distinct in rhythmic, image-rich prose modulating with intensity, as in softened light embrace. Dialogue natural and subtextual, advancing plot via Lira's firm kindness without exposition. No head-hopping or register drift; purposeful compression in reflection pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose concise with high density, varying rhythm in mist whispers and dawn rays; no loops or scaffold, strong verbs like "knelt" and "unfurled" propel without overwriting. Figurative language coherent, like "mist clung like a lover’s whisper," serving atmosphere without muddle. Final line recharges motifs effectively; minor filter verb in "he felt a shift" but voice-motivated and brief.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-recording lanterns and paradoxical island with grief-folding cranes transforms familiar loss tropes through specific craft details and luminous torment tone, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk in quiet, internal arc heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry. Minor echo of archetypal epiphany but personalized via basilica realization.</comment>
