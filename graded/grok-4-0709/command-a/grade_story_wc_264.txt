<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to cultivate sparks is clear and rooted in her relic-carrying traits, intensifying to compel her use of the charm and clock at pivotal moments. However, interiority relies on stock phrasing like feeling a "strange pull" without embodied contradictions or micro-choices revealing value hierarchies under pressure. The final endurance of her role shows credible renunciation with subtle cost, but flaws feel like labels rather than complicating choices simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery of light and sand to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the archive diverges, reweighting stakes with conceptual cost of new responsibilities. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first paragraph without debt. Closure lands on-page with the clock ticking and Mara's smile, but causality feels elliptical in the vortex pull, lacking a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The glowing dune is vividly sensory and purposeful, pulsing with life to guide Mara's path and mirror her hope, constraining choices like sinking boots and swirling vortex. It evolves causally, charging the final image as she steps back into it. Sensory details are POV-filtered and selective, but occupational depth for a freight guard is absent despite relevance to her scanning gaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of nurturing sparks signals early and deepens once when the archive's dimming forces clock use, narrowing options under textural pressure. Agency via charm and clock leads to stance crystallization with felt hope as cost, but conflict remains low-tension discovery without a clear reversal or ethical calculus sharpening the choice. Coincidence of the dune's response complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of divergent possibilities emerges organically from dune whispers and archive sparks, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights loss with hope without moralizing. Subtext in relics and embers invites reflection on memory's fragility. However, integration feels somewhat abstract, with the core concept echoing rather than transforming through conflicted experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and modest, with perceptual bias in Mara's scanning gaze and relic focus; no head-hopping or unwarranted certainty. Prose texture uses rhythmic, purposeful diction like "fractured lullaby," modulating with intensity. Elision of satchel contents is taught early and pays off subtly at closure without confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose advances atmosphere with vivid images like "luminescent sand," but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "glowing" descriptions) and awkward phrasing like "gaze occasionally everywhere" create minor artifacts dulling momentum. Information density is high in key beats, yet template cadence in sand-shifting sentences reduces propulsion. No major clarity issues touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes post-apocalyptic oasis with quantum-like archive in a non-obvious way, transforming relic tropes through Mara's role in divergence. Emotional specificity in hope's surge feels authentic, but echoes familiar fantasy journeys without bold risk-taking to heighten stakes. The final reconfiguration arises organically from particulars.</comment>
