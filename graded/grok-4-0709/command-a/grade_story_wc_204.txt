<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned imagery of frost, ruptures, and whispers, with one meaningful deepening in the cloud descent that reweights knowledge; orientation anchors early in the library setting. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing in her realization of the library as living entity and her caretaker role, with conceptual cost of eternal puzzle-solving made legible in the final image. Persistent constraint of the bottled whisper shapes tactics and charges the ending.</comment>

Moral calculus sharpens between order and chaos, with the whisper's guidance complicating without resolving.</comment>

Emotional aftereffect arises from her smile amid shifting world, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Elara's focus on patterns and frost, diction purposeful and rhythmic, modulating with intensity in the descent. Prose texture distinct in poetic syntax, consistent and voice-motivated. No dialogue present, so not evaluated; elision in cloud guidance is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
