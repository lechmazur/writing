<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to salvage purity from wreckage is clear and intensifies through dream analysis, compelling her to connect past and present; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion in her quickened heart and steady breath. However, internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses, relying on sequential revelations without deep flaws complicating choices. The final whisper reveals a hierarchy of values with felt cost, but emotions feel performed rather than contradictory under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through dream fragments to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the globe clears, reweighting the stake with conceptual cost of lost stories; orientation anchors who (Elara), where (glacier shrine), and when (night to dawn) by ~100 words. Closure lands on-page with the glowing globe and whispered names, charging the final image. One meaningful deepening suffices, but causality feels elliptical without a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The glacier shrine anchors early with vivid, purposeful sensory details like flickering flames and humming ice walls, filtered through Elara's POV; the setting constrains choices by providing a sanctuary for connection, charging the final image as dawn paints the sky. Micro-setting of the altar integrates into action, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Tone supports the hushed, dreamlike atmosphere effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering the globe's story signals early and deepens through accumulative dream visions, narrowing options to a stance crystallization at closure; one tightening via revelations forces trade-off of emotional burden. Under Accumulative lens, pressure coheres with cadence shift at dawn, but cost feels oblique without a visible price altering tactics. Coincidence in dream access complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of connecting living and dead emerges organically from dream analysis and the clearing globe, inviting reflection on salvaging purity without tidy morals; subtext in distorted reflections and whispers elicits emotional aftereffect of warmth in cold. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to voicing the voiceless. However, some ambiguity borders on vagueness, lacking counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in shadow-grace and dream visions; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, lyric syntax like "tapestry woven from fragments." No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision in visions is patterned and pays off at closure. Psychic distance shifts intentionally with focus, but some certainty exceeds focalizer knowledge in dream sourcing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "borrowed starlight" without loops; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in visions. Figurative language is controlled, but occasional mixed metaphors like "tapestry woven from fragments" and "thread connecting past" create minor muddle. No artifacts obscure closure, with strong verbs and specific nouns propelling momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wreck-diving and dream analysis transforms ghost-whisperer trope through Arctic specificity and accumulative method; emotional truth in salvaging stories feels authentic. However, premise echoes familiar lost-object narratives without bold risk-taking. The final reconfiguration grows from particulars, but lacks non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>
