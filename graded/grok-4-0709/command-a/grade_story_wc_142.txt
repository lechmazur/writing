<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to preserve community identity is clear and intensifies through her actions with the stone and graffiti, rooted in her role as culture shock absorber, but interiority relies on somewhat stock phrasing like "burned brighter" without deeply embodied contradictions. The final endurance feels earned with visible community cost at the festival, yet Vorin's one-note antagonism lacks secondary pressure to sharpen her choices. Emotions are embodied in her warmth from the stone, revealing values under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure links events logically from discovery to festival rally with motivated progression, anchoring orientation early in the raft city setting. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration via the festival's collective voice, with felt cost in ongoing fight against privatization, but the ending's shift to "brighter" promise feels slightly summarized rather than dramatized in a decisive on-page change. One meaningful tightening occurs as resistance builds to the turning point.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The raft city on the Cerulean Sea is vividly specific with patchwork barges and perpetual carnival atmosphere, filtering through Lira's POV to mirror her orderly mind amid chaos. Sensory details like amber hues and graffiti integration guide choices, such as following the trail, and the setting constrains options by contrasting Vorin's sleek barge with communal chaos. The environment charges the final festival image, evolving causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resisting gentrification signals early and tightens meaningfully at the festival, where community allegiance forces stance crystallization under Causal lens, with visible cost in potential erasure of identity. Pressure coheres but escalation feels accumulative rather than sharply narrowing options, as Vorin's resistance complicates without a full reversal. Agency in Lira's organization drives the Charged Poise closure, though coincidence of finding the stone slightly undercuts earned progression.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of dual allegiance to sea and community emerges organically from graffiti decoding and festival rally, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in ongoing fight. Subtext in symbols and stone's warmth invites reflection on identity loss, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without stating a moral. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through Lira's exhausted pride.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual bias in Lira's intuitive decoding, but dialogue like Vorin's sneer feels somewhat goal-driven without deep subtext or distinct idiom. Prose texture is purposeful with rhythmic descriptions, yet syntactic uniformity in action sequences slightly dulls under pressure. No head-hopping or unwarranted certainty, though free indirect style could sharpen interior shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with vivid images like "jigsaw puzzle of dreams and desperation," advancing atmosphere, but paraphrase loops in graffiti descriptions (e.g., intricate patterns repeated) and template cadence in action beats reduce momentum. Information density is high in key moments, yet overwriting in sunset hues muddles peak festival pressure without payoff. Rhythm varies, but minor scaffold in transitional sentences like "the next morning" lingers unnecessarily.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The raft city resisting gentrification offers a fresh synthesis of floating community and encoded warnings, transforming tropes through Lira's role and graffiti method, feeling organic rather than checklist. Emotional specificity in hopeful desperation heightens stakes, with the stone's reprise at closure providing non-obvious ingenuity. Bold setting risks cohere without gimmickry, though premise echoes familiar anti-privatization narratives.</comment>
