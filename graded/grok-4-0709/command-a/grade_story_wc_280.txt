<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to mend fractured timelines through echoes is clear and intensifies via her synesthetic senses, compelling her to summon and aid the despairing woman; interiority is concrete with embodied emotions like pulsing colors mirroring heartbeats. The final renunciation of full resolution carries a bittersweet cost, shown in her smile as the woman departs. However, the secondary character feels like a mirror rather than a crucible applying distinct pressure, limiting relational depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through layered sensory echoes and emotional densities toward a Resonant Reconfiguration, with the woman's smile and the healing timeline providing Charged Poise and conceptual cost in Mara's ongoing bondage. Orientation anchors early in the moonlit maze after closing, avoiding disorientation. A meaningful cadence shift occurs at dawn, reweighting hope, though causality feels more poetic than strictly motivated in the summons.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The mystic orchard within the hedge maze is vividly sensory, with night flowers, whispering trees, and shifting shadows filtering through Mara's synesthesia, constraining her movements and charging the final dawn image. Details like the dry fountain and blooming petals evolve with the action, mirroring internal renewal. Environment pressures choices, such as the coin's colors bleeding into the air to summon the woman.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of luring possibility from despair tightens through the emotional exchange at the fountain, deepening via the coin's color shift from despair to renewal, with a felt cost in Mara's bittersweet warmth. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure accumulates via sensory densities, but escalation feels more atmospheric than agency-driven, with no sharp reversal narrowing options. The resolution crystallizes stance, yet coincidence in the woman's emergence slightly undercuts earned progression.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of rewriting fractured timelines through echoes emerges organically from Mara's synesthetic interactions and the coin's role, culminating in a resonant final image of dawn-lit hope without stated morals. Subtext in gestures like holding the coin conveys shared despair turning to courage, inviting reflection on possibility. The ending offers a non-literal answer to binding promises, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost in Mara's enduring role.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV from Mara's perspective is stable, with perceptual signature in synesthetic hues of sound and emotion, like whispers as symphonies. Voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax that modulates with intensity, such as the haunting melody of her call. Dialogue is natural and subtextual, advancing the plot through gentle explanations; no head-hopping or unwarranted certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like colors bleeding into air, though occasional paraphrase loops, such as repeated whispers growing louder, slightly dull momentum. Rhythm varies naturally, with syntactic variety supporting emotional beats, like deliberate steps as melody notes. No major artifacts obscure closure, but some figurative stacking in the summons beat borders on overwriting without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise of a synesthetic stage ghost mending timelines via echoes offers a fresh synthesis of supernatural and emotional elements, transforming ghost tropes through theatrical flair and sensory originality. Risk in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, evident in the bittersweet dawn closure. However, the self-mirror interaction echoes familiar redemption arcs without bold subversion.</comment>
