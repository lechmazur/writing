<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to uncover hidden truths is clear and rooted in his ghost-seeing gift, intensifying through micro-choices like analyzing dust and climbing the counter, leading to an earned closure where the burden lifts with felt relief. Interiority is concrete, with embodied chills and pulls, but emotions occasionally lean on stock phrasing like "heart pounding" without deeper contradiction. The single-POV focus shows internal conflict effectively, though flaws feel lightly sketched rather than complicating choices with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure holds with because/therefore linkages from entering the office to inserting the barrel, culminating in a Decisive Change where the clock's activation heals the space and lifts Marcus's burden with legible emotional cost in the warmth and peace. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first paragraph without debt. One meaningful tightening occurs as ghosts materialize and point upward, narrowing options to the ceiling discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is vividly anchored with sensory details like sawdust scent and flickering lights, filtered through Marcus's observant POV, and the ceiling constrains the climactic choice by hiding the clock. Atmosphere builds eerie calm effectively, mirroring his internal draw to ghosts. Details evolve causally, such as dust patterns guiding action, though some repetition of cracks feels slightly overt without deeper mirroring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering hidden truths escalates causally through ghost whispers and materializations, tightening once as the girl points upward, forcing Marcus to climb and engage the clock with felt cost in his trembling hands and lifted burden. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens, with agency in his decision to insert the barrel driving the resolution. Stakes remain somewhat abstract, lacking a sharper trade-off or secondary accent to heighten visceral tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of confronting hidden cracks in facades emerges organically from Marcus's gift and the building's healing, resonating through images like the pulsing cracks and final clock movement without direct statements. Subtext in ghost interactions implies unresolved burdens, inviting reflection on closure's impermanence. The ending offers a non-literal reconfiguration of time and neglect, but ambiguity feels mildly tidy, lacking bolder counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual bias in Marcus's technical observations like dust patterns, and no unwarranted knowledge leaps. Voice has distinct texture in rhythmic, methodical prose that modulates with pressure, such as shorter sentences during the climb. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; elision of backstory is purposeful and anchors in present cues without excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like tarnished brass and pulsing cracks, and rhythm varies naturally without monotony. Some paraphrase loops appear, such as repeated emphasis on whispers growing louder, slightly dulling momentum in the middle. No major artifacts obscure closure, and final line recharges the motif effectively with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes ghost-seeing with technical observation in a fresh way, transforming circus abandonment into a metaphor for hidden burdens without stock tropes. Ingenuity shines in the mainspring barrel's integration as a healing mechanism, feeling inevitable at closure. However, the resolution echoes familiar redemption arcs, lacking a bolder risk in ambiguity or subversion.</comment>
