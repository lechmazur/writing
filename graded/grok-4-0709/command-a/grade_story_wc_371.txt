<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find the sacred in the ordinary is clear and rooted in her traits as a "creeping normality noticer," driving her guerrilla gardening with consistent, gentle actions. Interiority is concrete in moments like savoring the bread's tang, revealing embodied emotion and micro-choices under subtle pressure. However, emotions occasionally lean toward stock phrasing, such as "tenuous absolution," without deeper contradictory impulses in scene. The plaque discovery effectively reveals her hierarchy of values with a felt cost of fragility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through reflective shards in one continuous courtyard scene, with orientation anchored early in the overgrown palace and Elara's presence. Causality is textural via pattern of discoveries (bread, plaque), leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the plaque reweights her quest with conceptual cost of tenuous peace. One meaningful deepening occurs via the planting and uncovering, tightening her stance without needing multiple reversals. The ending's charged poise feels earned, though backstory reflection slightly exceeds BRR allowance without fully tilting present tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard is vividly anchored with sensory details like damp earth and fading blooms, filtered through Elara's POV to reflect her quest for renewal. Environmental elements, such as tangled vines and the tea house, constrain her actions and charge the final image of sprouts and lavender. Specificity in scents (chamomile, jasmine) and tactile navigation supports atmosphere without excess. The plaque's uncovering integrates setting into closure, mirroring her internal restoration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of seeking tenuous absolution escalates through textural density in discoveries, with one meaningful deepening via the plaque that reweights her motivation and forces stance crystallization. Pressure is coherent but internal, with cost felt in the fragility of her peace rather than visible trade-offs. No multiple reversals needed, but coincidence of bread and plaque findings complicates without fully narrowing options via agency. The ending's reconfiguration lands with conceptual cost, though stakes remain somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of finding sacred in ordinary emerges organically from Elara's gardening and discoveries, with subtext in symbols like bread and plaque implying restoration without direct statements. The core concept integrates via tenuous absolution, inviting reflection on renewal amid decay. Final image of lavender and peace offers resonant, non-literal answer reweighting the premise with ambiguity. However, occasional explicit echoes, like the plaque's inscription, border on thematic statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Elara's selective noticing of subtle shifts and nature details, modulating rhythm under reflective pressure. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, flowing syntax that breathes with her movements, like brushing crumbs before stepping out. No dialogue present, so policy applies; no head-hopping or elision issues. Final lantern light image maintains voice coherence without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "crust still faintly warm" without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally in paragraphs. Some figurative language, such as whispering courtyard, integrates without muddle, supporting momentum. Minor template cadence in reflective blocks, like repeated "she" openings, slightly dulls propulsion but doesn't obscure closure. Clarity is strong, with clean grammar and purposeful syntax enhancing the textural lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise of a "creeping normality noticer" finding absolution via guerrilla gardening in ruins offers fresh synthesis of decay and renewal, transforming familiar tropes through specific details like vanished bakery bread. Risk in quiet, reflective structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. However, core elements feel somewhat prompt-derived without bold, non-obvious inflections. The plaque's inscription provides an earned turn inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
