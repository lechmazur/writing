<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find the resilience source is clear and drives her actions, but interiority relies on stock phrasing like "heart raced" without embodied contradiction under pressure. The final realization of her purpose feels unearned, lacking prior micro-choices that foreclose paths with visible cost. Strengths include consistent traits as an intrepid pilot shown through navigation, yet flaws complicate choices minimally, trending toward tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, the structure links actions logically from artifact recovery to grove restoration, with a meaningful tightening during gravity inversion leading to the holographic map. Closure is a Decisive Change as Elara presses the arrow tip, restoring resilience with a felt conceptual cost in her new protective role. Orientation anchors early in the orchard planet, but some ellipsis in travel feels unmotivated, slightly weakening causality at the grove arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The orchard planet's floating arches and inverting gravity are vividly specific, constraining Elara's navigation and charging the final grove image with bioluminescent moss and shimmering fruit. Sensory details like scent and hum integrate into action, reflecting POV urgency, though some repetition of "whirling silence" borders on static. Environment pressures choices effectively, such as anchoring during inversion, without factual errors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding the resilience source escalates causally through the warming arrow tip and inversion, tightening options with a meaningful deepening at the holographic map reveal. Agency culminates in pressing the artifact, earning restoration with visible cost in the fading echoes' urgency. However, pressure feels somewhat abstract, with no sharp reversal forcing trade-offs, and coincidence in the artifact's pulsing complicates without fully resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges organically from the planet's echoes and Elara's discovery, resisting tidy morals by embracing chaos-life balance with ambiguity in her ongoing journey. Subtext in the artifact's pulsing and grove's chorus invites reflection, but the final epiphany states the theme overtly ("she had discovered the source of resilience... for herself"), verging on moralizing. Resonance arises from particulars like the restored growth, yet lacks non-literal depth in the closing image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable, with perceptual signature in Elara's attuned senses to planetary whispers, and prose texture modulates rhythmically during inversion. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; elision in travel is purposeful but taught minimally. Strengths include consistent diction fitting the exploratory voice, though some filter verbs like "felt the arrow tip grow warmer" dull immediacy slightly under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise with varied rhythm, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "shimmering river" without major loops, though some paraphrase redundancy appears in repeated "resilience" descriptions. Information density is high in key beats, but figurative language like "branches heavy with fruit that shimmered like stars" muddles slightly in the climax without harming clarity. No significant artifacts obscure closure, and syntax propels momentum effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The premise of a gravity-inverting orchard planet with echoes offers a fresh synthesis of sci-fi quest and ecological theme, transforming tropes through specific navigation by water flow. However, the artifact-as-key resolution echoes familiar fantasy motifs without bold risk-taking, feeling somewhat derivative. Ingenuity shines in the inversion's pressure on tactics, but lacks a non-obvious inflection at closure to elevate fully.</comment>
