<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to free the ghost is clear and rooted in her kinship as a seldom-heard voice, intensifying through her actions with the bolt plate. Interiority is concrete in her intuition and heart racing, but emotions lean toward performed rather than deeply contradictory impulses under pressure. The final renunciation of the ghost's presence carries a felt cost in their fleeting touch, earning credibility without stock epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure links Elara's discovery of the bolt plate to her encoding action, leading to the ghost's release as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost in the lost connection. Orientation anchors early in the misty courtyard, avoiding disorientation penalties. Closure lands on-page with the ghost dissolving into mist, reconfiguring Elara's purpose, though the storm's role feels slightly coincidental without fully narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above clouds is vivid and purposeful, with storm elements like lightning constraining the timeframe and charging the encoding action. Sensory details filter through Elara's alert state, mirroring her internal kinship without overt symbolism. The setting evolves causally with shifting graffiti and mist, culminating in the ghost's luminous form that charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of freeing the ghost tightens meaningfully during the lightning-thunder window, driven by Elara's agency in encoding, with a visible cost in the ghost's dissolution. Under Causal lens, pressure escalates via storm cues, narrowing options without multiple reversals. Coincidence of the relic's discovery complicates but does not resolve, though stakes remain somewhat abstract until the fleeting hand touch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of giving voice to the voiceless emerges organically from Elara's song and the ghost's release, with subtext in their kinship and the bolt plate as conduit. The final image of the ghost dissolving into stardust offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through Elara's quiet clarity, embracing complexity in her ongoing work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Elara's attuned senses to storm whispers, modulating rhythmically with emotional intensity. Prose texture is distinct in haunting, poetic diction, consistent under pressure without register drift. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; purposeful compression in the storm sequence pays off at closure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose maintains high density and propulsion, with varied rhythm in sentences like "her voice, soft yet haunting, carried on the wind" advancing atmosphere without loops. Figurative language, such as "scattered like stardust," is controlled and payoff-oriented in the closure beat, avoiding muddle. Minor scaffold in repetitive "ghost’s presence" phrasing deducts slightly, but clarity and concision support momentum overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of cryptographer-balladeer freeing a data ghost via relic and graffiti feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tech-fantasy tropes through Elara's specific kinship. Risk in the ethereal tone heightens stakes without gimmickry, as in the lightning-timed encoding. Core premise commits fully, avoiding derivative templates with non-obvious moral ambiguity in the ghost's grateful yet dissolving exit.</comment>
