<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to uncover deleted files is clear and rooted in her brightly attentive trait, compelling her choices like bypassing security, but interiority relies on somewhat stock phrasing without deep contradictory impulses in scene. The decision to expose the truth feels earned with a felt cost to her role, yet relationships are absent, limiting crucible pressure. Flaws complicate her investigation authentically, shown through her lie to the supervisor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the plot advances through because/therefore linkages from discovering the patch to decoding numbers and accessing files, leading to a Decisive Change in Elara's final decision to expose the truth with legible cost to her safety. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first paragraph without debt. Closure lands on-page with Charged Poise as she steps out, reconfiguring options, though one more tightening could elevate it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The social network archive is vividly detailed through digital expanse and metadata, constraining Elara's choices like using an old terminal, and the patch as a recurring object charges the final image. Sensory details are selective, focusing on visual and auditory cues like the song's melody, integrated into action without stalling. Atmosphere supports the sensed absence tone, mirroring internal voids.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of solving the cold case escalates causally through discoveries narrowing options, with one meaningful tightening when the system locks her out, forcing offline investigation and a visible cost in lying to her supervisor. Agency drives the deepening via her decisions, though coincidence in number patterns slightly complicates without resolving. Stakes feel visceral in the crew's disappearance, culminating in her stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of absence and forgotten truths emerges organically from the archive's voids and the song's echoes, reweighted in the final image without moralizing, inviting reflection on corporate silence. Subtext in numbers as pleas deepens complexity, avoiding tidy resolutions. The core concept integrates through specific events like the transmission, eliciting an emotional aftereffect of unresolved haunting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-bound, with perceptual signature in Elara's attentive scans and no head-hopping. Narrative voice has rhythmic control, modulating with intensity like heart racing during discoveries, and diction fits her professional lexicon without register drift. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; elision in investigation feels purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with good density, advancing through vivid sentences like the song syncing with numbers, but minor template cadence in investigation beats (e.g., "as she delved deeper, recurring numbers began appearing") triggers a small loop penalty without obscuring closure. Rhythm varies naturally, and metaphors like "sensed absence" are coherent without muddle. Final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise of a digital archive hiding spaceship secrets offers a fresh sci-fi angle on missing persons, transformed through Elara's specific choices like decoding coordinates, but echoes familiar conspiracy tropes without bold risk-taking. Originality in syncing numbers with song rhythm feels organic and inevitable in hindsight. No close echoes of famous scenes, but middle-ground hedging limits ingenuity.</comment>
