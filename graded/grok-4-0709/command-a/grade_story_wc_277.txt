<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation to uncover truths is clear and rooted in her observant trait, intensifying through discoveries that compel her investigation, but interiority relies on somewhat stock phrasing like "orbits of regret" without deeply embodied contradictions in key moments. The final recalibration shows a meaningful endurance with felt cost, yet flaws like label-only emotions in the director meeting slightly flatten her complexity. Relationships are absent on-page, so no crucible pressure from others applies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure links events through because/therefore progression from the call to investigation and recalibration, but causality weakens with off-page vanishings and evasive responses that don't force immediate turns. Closure lands as a Decisive Change in recalibrating the telescope with symbolic cost, yet the cost feels more conceptual than viscerally felt on-page. Orientation anchors early in the observatory, avoiding penalties.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The observatory setting is vividly anchored with glass dome and brass telescopes, filtering details through Eleanor's observant POV to mirror her unease, such as misaligned lenses pointing earthward. Sensory specifics like dawn light and echoes integrate into action, subtly guiding her choices without overt symbolism. However, it doesn't fully constrain the final recalibration choice to charge the image at a higher level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of exposing misuse escalates causally through discoveries narrowing options, with one meaningful tightening in uncovering the dissident monitoring, but pressure remains somewhat abstract without a sharper reversal or visible cost mid-story. The recalibration offers agency in defiance, yet coincidence in the journalist's vanishing complicates without resolving, and stakes feel declared rather than viscerally tested at peak. Under Causal lens, escalation tightens once adequately but lacks a trade-off that forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of devotion to truth amid regret emerges organically from Eleanor's investigations and symbolic recalibration, inviting reflection on burdens without tidy morals, but subtext in gestures like tracing the pen nib is underplayed. The final image offers a resonant non-literal answer by redirecting to stars, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. However, overt statements like "orbits of regret" border on thematic echo, slightly reducing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature biased toward observant details like telescope alignments, and prose texture distinct in rhythmic, reflective syntax. Brief dialogue in the director meeting carries subtext and evasion naturally, advancing plot without exposition. No head-hopping or register mismatch, but some filter verbs in interiority mildly dull immediacy under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise with varied rhythm and strong verbs, advancing atmosphere through specifics like "faint whispers of the wind," but occasional paraphrase loops, such as repeating regret motifs, create minor redundancy without payoff. Information density is high in investigative beats, yet figurative language like "orbits of regret" feels slightly muddled in peak moments. No major artifacts obscure closure, but template cadence in reflective blocks slightly drags momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The premise of a misused observatory for spying offers a fresh angle on journalism and truth-seeking, transformed through Eleanor's heiress background and symbolic defiance, but echoes familiar conspiracy tropes without bold risk-taking. Emotional specificity in her resolve feels authentic, yet the synthesis relies on convenient vanishings rather than non-obvious ingenuity. The recalibration turn arises organically but lacks a memorable perspective shift.</comment>
