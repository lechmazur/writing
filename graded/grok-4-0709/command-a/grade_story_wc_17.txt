<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clearly rooted in her family's legacy and her sensitive perception, driving higher-stakes choices like pressing the wall, with embodied emotions shown through trembling fingers and racing heart. Interiority is concrete and particular, revealing contradictory impulses in her caution versus obsession, culminating in an earned reconfiguration where the burden becomes purpose. A minor slip in stock phrasing, like "heart raced," slightly dilutes specificity, but the hierarchy of values is visible in her decision to honor the walls' dreams.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered discoveries—film strip, diaries, chamber—leading to a resonant reconfiguration in the final chamber where the mirror-window reprices the legacy's meaning with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first paragraph, with no disorientation debt. One meaningful deepening occurs via the diaries and map revelation, sufficient for length, though the ellipsis from passage to chamber feels slightly undermotivated without a stronger causal link.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage is vividly sensory, with humidity, moss, and curling tendrils filtering through POV bias to mirror her perceptive nature, constraining choices like pausing at the crack. Details evolve causally, as ivy parts at the end, charging the final image and supporting theme without overt symbolism. The micro-setting of the fireplace and pedestal directly shapes the closure, meeting the 9+ test by constraining her realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of discovering walls' dreams escalates through density increase in echoes and insistent dreams, culminating in a meaningful cadence shift at the mirror that reweights the burden with felt cost. One tightening via the diaries forces stance crystallization, narrowing options to honoring memories. Coincidence of the film strip clarifying complicates but doesn't resolve, with agency in her renunciation of mere mapping.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of honoring forgotten stories emerges organically from discoveries like the diaries' warning and the mirror's vision, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the walls' pulsing chorus. Subtext in ivy as watching fingers and the film strip's dual map/face enriches resonance without direct statement. The final image offers a non-literal answer, repricing the legacy, though a touch of sentimentality in "it felt like purpose" slightly softens emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>No dialogue, so focus on voice: third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in hearing history's hum and noticing ivy's fingers, modulating rhythm under pressure like shorter sentences in the chamber. Prose texture is distinct, with purposeful compression in discoveries; no head-hopping or elision issues. Diction fits the focalizer's cartographic worldview, avoiding register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "walls breathing with whispers," varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold. Minor artifact in repetitive "seemed to" phrasing (e.g., "seemed to watch," "seemed to close in," "seemed to pulse") slightly dulls propulsion but doesn't obscure closure. Strong verbs and specific details propel beats, with clean grammar and no muddle in peak moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of mapping walls' dreams offers a fresh synthesis of exploration and intangible legacy, transformed through specific details like the film strip's dual nature and the mirror-window, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric, accumulative style heightens stakes without gimmickry, though echoes of gothic exploration tropes are not fully subverted. Emotional specificity in the burden's shift avoids generics, committing to the premise's implications.</comment>
