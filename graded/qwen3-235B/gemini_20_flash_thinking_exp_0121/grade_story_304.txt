<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation and self-awareness inconsistently developed; poetic aspirations for "cradling dawn" lack concrete manifestation through actions or internal conflict resolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure follows minimal arc but relies on nebulous symbol (spiderweb signal) without establishing logical connections; pacing static within 400-word constraint.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid's sensory details (space dust/metallic tang) create compelling atmosphere, but "borrowed starlight" tone remains disconnected from emotional undertones.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Excessive reliance on abstract phrases ("superficially profound pronouncements") and atmospheric descriptors teeters on purple prose; spiderweb device feels algorithmically contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story assembles required elements but fails to integrate them cohesively; brevity exacerbates rather than enhances narrative tension or thematic resolution.</comment>
