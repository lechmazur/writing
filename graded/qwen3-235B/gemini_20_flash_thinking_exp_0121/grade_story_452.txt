<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot follows static progression rather than dynamic structure; action driving stabilization feels arbitrary; pacing maintains consistency but lacks tension arc; cause-effect relationships remain unearned metaphysical assertions rather than narrative logic</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere effectively leverages cyberpunk/planetarium contrast; sensory details adequate but generic; organic/synthetic dichotomy underdeveloped; setting connections feel decorative rather than integral to cosmic fate concept</comment>
