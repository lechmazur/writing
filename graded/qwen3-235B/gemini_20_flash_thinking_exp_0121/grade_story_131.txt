<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara's aloofness is consistent but underdeveloped; her orphan status remains a surface trait. The stones and reaction to the cryptic message reinforce her introspective detachment, but motivations shift abruptly from isolation to curiosity without sufficient nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The plot follows a logical arc (discovery→adaptation), but pacing is uneven: the transformation feels rushed, time compression of "garage cleaning timeframe" is underused, and the ending lacks tension resolution despite thematic closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Gravitational anomaly creates vivid, warped atmosphere with sensory details (dust, shimmering light), though its narrative impact remains superficial. The setting amplifies mood and symbolism but rarely drives plot actions beyond aesthetic contrast.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Symbolism of stones and adaptation resonates, but emotional impact is diluted by abstract telling ("fear loosened its grip"). The ending feels thematic rather than earned, with subtext about detachment lacking visceral grounding.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but relies on familiar "chosen one" motifs (lottery ticket as map) and occasional purple prose ("predictable unpredictability"). The anomaly concept is original, yet tone occasionally borders on melodramatic without subverting genre expectations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements are competently integrated but not inseparable from the story’s structure. The gravitational anomaly and stones feel essential, while others (timeframe, "softly audible") serve decorative roles. Concludes with thematic clarity but minimal narrative innovation.</comment>
