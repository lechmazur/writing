<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara’s lukewarm power and "loyally peculiar" devotion to the doormat are established but underexplored; her motivation to escape fear drives the plot but lacks emotional depth through showing rather than telling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>A clear beginning-to-end progression exists, but the tight word limit leaves the clash’s resolution ambiguous; pacing is deliberate, though cause/effect in her defense method feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (e.g., "thick enough to taste like moondust") immerse readers in the lunar base’s haunted serenity; the setting amplifies isolation but struggles to fully integrate Earthly nostalgia.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors like "painting a future" and ephemeral silhouettes offer thematic resonance; the ending feels unresolved but purposeful, leaving tension intact. Emotional impact is muted by abstract, somewhat passive narration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in concept (illusions over brute magic) but occasionally slips into ornate phrasing ("charred serenity," "loyally peculiar"); avoids major clichés but leans on poetic abstraction rather than visceral immediacy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively deployed, though some (e.g., the timeframe) feel decorative rather than essential. The lunar base and doormat anchor the narrative, but subtext remains surface-level.</comment>
