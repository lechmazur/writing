<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character is conceptually strong but remains archetypal; motivations are clear but underdemonstrated through concrete actions, leaning on expository statements rather than nuanced behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Structure is coherent but feels more like a static vignette than a progression; transitions work, but the tight word limit restricts deeper development of cause-effect dynamics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through sensory details and symbolic contrasts, but the setting occasionally leans on familiar retro-futuristic tropes without fully subverting them.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes resonate intellectually, but emotional impact is diluted by occasional over-reliance on abstract language; strong symbolism in the dice and chalk equations elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Some fresh ideas are undermined by generically described emotions ("quiet wisdom," "palpable shift") and slightly formulaic metaphors; the fusion of indigenous knowledge with futuristic themes is original but unevenly executed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but occasionally feel dictated by prompt constraints; length exposes underdeveloped tensions between theme and character, though the central metaphor lingers.</comment>
