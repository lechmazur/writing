<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character shows surface consistency but lacks interiority; restlessness manifests in repetitive motion rather than evolving motivations; "earnestly deceptive" trait remains abstract rather than shaping meaningful emotional conflicts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot has basic cause-effect logic but feels compressed; discovery-to-vision transition lacks temporal anchoring; the lantern's revelation arrives too conveniently to satisfy narrative tension within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Gritty Martian environment rendered through precise tactile details (dust, brass textures) but Earth flashbacks become aesthetically flat rather than mythic; atmosphere supports theme through sensory economy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Imagery often striking but inconsistent; lantern as "sewing" history stands out; excessive adjectival density ("cautious abandon") dilutes impact; subtext present but requires reader investment to decode.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Earnestly deceptive" concept recycled mechanically; "crimson Martian dust" feels over-rehearsed; visions of Earth avoid clich√© through fragmentation; voice occasionally slips into expository cadence despite lyrical intent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements work collaboratively but not transcendentally; brevity serves theme but shortchanges character complexity; closing image offers conceptual resonance that lingers beyond immediate narrative.</comment>
