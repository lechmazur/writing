<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original premise and atmospheric contrasts are undermined by overused metaphors ("unraveling thread") and self-consciously poetic phrasing that distracts from nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively arranged but lack narrative urgency; the storyâ€™s potential as commentary on artificiality feels only partially realized.</comment>
