<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character has consistent traits ("daydreaming," "seldom regular") driving abstract actions, but lacks humanizing contradictions or emotional depth. Motivation stated but not earned through organic progression.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot moves linearly from discovery to creation, but lacks tension or meaningful consequences. The act of etching doesn't build toward a definable climax within the constrained word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Visually immersive with vivid contrast between decay and serenity; "pristine chaos" executed through filtered light and preserved ice. Satellite-object connection feels underexploited beyond its basic utility.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Abstract themes of compassion-as-permanent-mark resonate conceptually, but emotional impact diluted by excessive "telling" via repetitive phrasing ("pristine chaos," "seldom regular"). Memorable imagery undercut by shallow subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids cliché juxtapositions (e.g., cursed palace as sanctuary) and offers fresh metaphors (satellite-as-chisel). Occasional redundancies ("seldom regular" repeated 7x) and over-reliance on adjective-heavy descriptors weaken otherwise inventive premise.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>High concept potential undermined by uneven execution. Elements serve thematic cohesion but lack interdependence – the palace, satellite, and scuff-marks could each exist without significantly altering the story's trajectory.</comment>
