<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks psychological complexity; actions align with traits but remain symbolic rather than deeply human.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Well-structured narrative with coherent progression, though the plot's mythic simplicity occasionally undermines emotional stakes despite effective resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory-rich setting creates an immersive, mystical atmosphere that powerfully enhances both character motivation and thematic depth through evocative imagery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant symbolism and layered themes elevate the narrative; the paradoxical "shouting silence" and botanical keys create memorable metaphors that support a satisfying, reflective conclusion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Some poetic flourishes border on pretentiousness, and familiar mythic structures (wise old woman, artist's block) lack sufficient subversion, though the central metaphor of "melodic sculpture" offers freshness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Elements integrate smoothly despite the high concept count; the parable-like brevity feels intentional rather than constrained, leaving a lingering philosophical impression.</comment>
