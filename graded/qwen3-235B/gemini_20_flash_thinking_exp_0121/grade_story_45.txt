<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character has clear motivation (guilt redemption) and actions align with it, but inner complexity remains underexplored despite poetic descriptions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot lacks cohesive cause/effect; gravity failure and cryptic coordinates feel arbitrary. Resolution is atmospheric but structurally thin within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is vivid and surreal (floating museum, chrome temple), though some elements like "bioluminescent flora" feel superficially applied rather than integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Echoes of emotional themes exist, but relies on vague metaphors ("dull radiance") over concrete emotional beats. Final shoot emerging is simplistic symbolism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes verge on purple prose; repetitive descriptors ("quiet, shimmering lament") and overly abstract concepts ("silent overture") detract from authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is ambitious but elements feel checklist-driven rather than organically combined. Memorable imagery is undercut by shallow thematic development.</comment>
