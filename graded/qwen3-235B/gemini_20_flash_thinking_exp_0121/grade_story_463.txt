<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation lacks depth and nuance; dry-wittedness isn't substantiated through dialogue or distinct voice. Actions feel performative rather than revealing of personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Pacing is contained but resolution feels abrupt; the dance method as a plot device lacks organic connection to the ghostly premise. Logical gaps in how "confiscation" works undermine coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details create strong atmosphere, particularly with the rope's symbolism mirroring the setting. The dance element, however, jars with the brooding tone of the haunted space.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Uses effective metaphors (rope, waltz) and attempts subtext about tradition vs. force. Ending lacks emotional weight; conflict resolution feels perfunctory despite lyrical prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lands uncomfortably between atmospheric and clich√©d; "dry-witted sentinel" is underdeveloped, and the dance method feels formulaic rather than innovative. Some fresh symbolism but uneven emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elements like the rope and haunted setting are atmospheric but struggle to form a cohesive narrative. The story demonstrates technical polish but feels constrained by its own ornate concept.</comment>
