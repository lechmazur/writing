<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict is clear but underdeveloped; the shift from scientific detachment to primal resolve feels abrupt and lacks nuanced emotional progression or distinct narrative voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc but feels slightly compressed; the connection between the hair clip and the climactic decision works, though pacing occasionally strains against the word limit, with underexplored transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered in moments (e.g., "cheap sheen," "clinking glasses") but the lab and restaurant settings aren’t fully integrated; sensory details enhance mood but lack deeper layering.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Story employs effective metaphors (sunrise as innovation, plastic hair clip as superficiality) and evokes thoughtful tension between tradition and radical change; ending resonates thematically, though emotional depth is somewhat muted.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on recognizable tropes (e.g., the "revelatory object" in mundane settings); prose is purposeful but occasionally veers into abstraction ("primal sophistication") without fully grounding its ideas.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a functional narrative with thematic ambition; the brevity works for the concept but sacrifices deeper exploration of character and setting, leaving some potential unmet.</comment>
