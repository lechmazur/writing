<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Characters remain archetypal; Silas reads as a symbol rather than a person, motivations feel more philosophical assertion than lived experience. Professor's skepticism serves plot function but lacks idiosyncratic depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Narrative coherence hinges on atmospheric momentum rather than structural rigor. The pivotal shift to "dark room" lacks transitional logic, and the conclusion feels suspended mid-implication rather than resolved.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Contrast between Victorian decorum and jungle vitality provides potent undercurrent, with evocative detailing (humidity, bottle cap gleam). Undermined by occasional generic descriptors ("thick with unseen life") diluting immersive potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of epistemological vulnerability resonate through symbolic action, but emotional impact remains cerebral rather than visceral. Prose rhythm alternates between crisp precision and ornamental abstraction, diluting emotional urgency.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Narrative voice oscillates between vivid specificity and AI-style abstraction ("earnest absurdity" recurs as conceptual crutch). Some tropes (talismanic object, zealot-skeptic dynamic) lack transformative reinvention despite atmospheric ingenuity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Element integration achieves thematic synergy (bottle cap as pact-symbol) but struggles with tonal consistency. Brief length serves conceptual compression but risks shallowness in developing Silas's cosmology as anything beyond mood conduit.</comment>
