<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's zealotry drives his focus on sacrifice through currency, but lacks psychological depth; motivation is clear but underexplored beyond abstract yearning. The method's connection to his "mild" zealotry feels underspecified.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The plot hinges on introspection rather than action, resulting in a static arc; internal revelation feels abrupt within the word limit, with insufficient tension or narrative momentum to structure progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting immerses through sensory details (ozone, machinery) and contrasts the lab's sterility with the weathered currency; atmosphere powerfully amplifies themes of decay and forgotten legacy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (currency as sacrifice) and imagery (dust, machines) evoke reflection on erasure, but emotional resonance is diluted by abstract prose; ending underscores theme but lacks visceral impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Detailed sensory language and conceptual premise avoid clich√©, but phrases like "dust motes danced" verge on overused; characterization leans on philosophical abstraction rather than nuanced human behavior.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically (sacrifice, legacy) but lack narrative urgency; brevity serves the contemplative tone but undermines character and plot development.</comment>
