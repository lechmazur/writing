<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's shiftness and spontaneity are stated but inconsistently demonstrated; motivation is clear but emotional complexity feels simplified. Reactions to objects lack nuanced psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Parole hearing and mineralization attempt drive plot, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit. Logical flow is maintained, though some causal links are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Abandoned drive-in's sensory details create mood, but circus elements verge on clich√©d surrealism. Atmosphere supports theme but lacks distinct originality in setting interactions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Emotional resonance and metaphorical imagery (emotions as nebulae) elevate impact, though some emotions are told rather than shown. Theme of failed attempts/redemption is effective but not fully profound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Occasional purple prose ("tears tracing paths through grime") and generic descriptors. Surreal circus elements feel derivative rather than subversive. Emotional nuance struggles with overly explicit declarations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements integrate minimally cohesively but often feel checklist-driven. Conceptual ambition exceeds execution; brevity works against deeper exploration of complex themes. Lingering impression fades quickly despite promising ideas.</comment>
