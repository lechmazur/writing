<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (chronicling tech shifts) is clear but grief's depth feels underdeveloped; actions align with traits but emotional nuance lacks full immersion.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot coherence exists through thematic meditation but lacks dynamic progression; strong through-line between parade float and silence metaphor but feels static within tight word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (parchment scent, mechanical dragon) create immersive atmosphere; setting underscores technological dissonance though secret society element feels underexplored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cohesive thematic unity with lingering emotional weight; brief length serves as intentional introspective snapshot but lacks ambition to push structural boundaries.</comment>
