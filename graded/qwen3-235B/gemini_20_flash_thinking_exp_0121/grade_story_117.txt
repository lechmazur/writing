<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character traits are present but underdeveloped beyond surface descriptors; motivation feels somewhat abstract and lacks psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Linear progression lacks narrative tension; closure feels contrived rather than organically earned through character decisions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Fluency over substance—relies on familiar fantasy tropes (hidden melodies, haunted mansions) with superficial twists; lacks the visceral authenticity of human-written surrealism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements coexist without synergistic impact; short form exposes structural fragility rather than celebrating brevity as an artistic choice.</comment>
