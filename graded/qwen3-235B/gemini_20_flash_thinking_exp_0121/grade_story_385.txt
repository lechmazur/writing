<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation lacks concrete connection to actions despite consistent tone; character's manipulative nature is explicit but insufficiently tied to symbolic objects.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Plot lacks resolution; beginning/middle differentiation exists but weakening lacks payoff; method's metaphorical use strains narrative logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Obsidian skyscraper/hospital contrast creates striking visuals but inconsistent worldbuilding; some sensory details (city light reflections) immerse, others remain superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (footprints, seeds) add subtext but undermine impact through overabundance; atmosphere engages but thematic cohesion on decoding truth through chaos remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original concept undermined by occasional purple prose (e.g., "heart of the obsidian skyscraper"); avoids clich√©s but some forced metaphors suggest conceptual strain.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements coexist rather than synergize; tone/setting feel intentional but length exacerbates underdeveloped connections between metaphorical devices and narrative progression.</comment>
