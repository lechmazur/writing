<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character attributes shape Barnaby's actions unevenly; his "stoic" nature clashes with sudden vulnerability, creating inconsistency. Core motivation to return wallet feels underdeveloped despite surface plausibility.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot hinges on paper plane reveal, but pacing strains within word limit. The chance encounter's emotional resonance feels rushed; cause-effect between wallet return and emotional arc lacks gradual buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere blends contrasting settings (beehive sanctuary vs. bar) with evocative details like "golden energy" and "rebellious static," but sensory immersion remains unevenly distributed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism of paper plane as untamed sincerity creates emotional subtext. Ending suggests thematic cohesion about vulnerability, but some emotional beats feel stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Writing avoids overt tropes but occasionally drifts into stylized descriptions ("whimsical paper plane") and overly ornate phrasing. Tone remains consistent despite moments of artificiality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story maintains cohesion but relies on thematic rather than narrative tightness. Brief length exposes underdeveloped character history; leaves lingering impressions but lacks structural innovation.</comment>
