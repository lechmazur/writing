<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's meekness is clear but slightly underexplored; motivation to escape is consistent but lacks nuanced inner conflict; actions align with traits but feel somewhat abstracted from human complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but relies on abrupt transitions; the use of gold threads feels under-explained; pacing is generally controlled but occasionally strained by the word limit when introducing key elements.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details (mirage, smoke, tactile descriptions); atmosphere powerfully reinforces themes, though occasional overdescription risks diluting immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (mirage as prison, tech as entrapment) and lyrical prose elevate it; emotional resonance is present but occasionally diluted by over-reliance on telling rather than showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s but includes flowery phrasing and occasional vague descriptors; the concept of "xenializing" is inventive but its logic lacks grounding; tone remains consistent but occasionally veers toward overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are integrated with creativity but uneven cohesion; the metaphorical strength and atmospheric writing suggest literary potential, but underdeveloped themes and slightly mechanical execution prevent full realization.</comment>
