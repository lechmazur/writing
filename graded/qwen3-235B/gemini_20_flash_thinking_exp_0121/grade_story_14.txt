<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's gambling nature drives her final choice, but her transition from skepticism to desperation lacks sufficient introspection. Motivation clear but under-developed through inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot moves logically toward decommissioning deadline, but compressed arc feels rushed during Elara's conversion to the professors' plan. Certain connections (casino-to-candlelight shift) work better than others.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Effective contrast between humming turbines and candlelit rituals creates unsettling atmosphere. Sensory details strongest in describing cold metal vs warm candlelight and oceanic metaphors for emotional states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Emotional impact comes through gambling parallels and existential dread. Symbols like candles-as-sparks work well, but dialogue ("laughing tears", "vessel for capturing sparks") falls into mystical prophet clich√©s.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic structures, but candle-as-macguffin feels slightly contrived. Some forced metaphors ("turbines mirroring tides") and character reasoning lacks psychological nuance beneath surface desperation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements work cohesively within tight word count, though midnight lectures as primary method feels somewhat conventional. Brief format enhances urgency but restricts deeper exploration of core concepts.</comment>
