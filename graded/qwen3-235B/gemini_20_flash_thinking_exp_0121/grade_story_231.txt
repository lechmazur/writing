<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Ur-Nammu's spontaneous nature drives action but "sentimental" trait remains mostly internal, with hairpin's emotional resonance underexplored. Motivation to "welcome chaos" feels intellectualized rather than embodied through visceral choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Boast drives plot but final voyage parallel feels forced. Coordinate revelation lacks buildup, making resolution abrupt. Concept of justice remains abstract rather than structurally integrated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dense atmosphere with frankincense and cuneiform details effectively immerses, though Sumerian context remains superficial. Sensory elements enrich tone but historical specificity feels decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors ("chaos as teacher") intellectually engaging but emotional impact diluted by excessive abstraction. Ending thematically resonant yet emotionally distant. Central conflict stays conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose occasionally lapses into ornate phrases ("grains of sand like golden hours"), undermining authenticity. Conceptual framework shows ingenuity but character psychology remains schematic rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Element integration competent but uneven: coordinate method feels convenient rather than organic. Stylistic ambition exceeds execution in balancing lyrical prose with narrative momentum.</comment>
