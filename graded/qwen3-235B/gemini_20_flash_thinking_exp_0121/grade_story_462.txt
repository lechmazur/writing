<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character is thinly sketched; motivation stated but not dramatized through concrete actions. Internal conflict remains abstract, reactions to environment feel passive rather than revelatory. No distinct voice in narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot lacks forward momentum or resolution. Atmospheric stagnation dominates, with thematic repetition substituting for structural development. Conceptual connections remain underdeveloped within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting rendered with visceral sensory detail; the decaying carnival house of mirrors achieves oppressive immediacy. Atmospheric cohesion between salt/decay imagery and fractured light creates immersive tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Symbolism (phoenix, tapping) resonates thematically but risks overinterpretation. The ending's flicker of hope feels earned through accumulative imagery, though emotional impact is muted by diffuse tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Excessive metaphorical abstraction ("cradle of sparks") veers into purple prose. Sensory details show originality but risk preciousness. Conceptual framework feels consciously constructed rather than organically emergent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere at surface level but lack narrative necessity. The self-contained setting works effectively, though thematic ambition outpaces structural payoff. Lingering questions feel tentative rather than deliberate.</comment>
