<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character's assigned traits (careless pilot, deliberately dreamy) are vaguely operationalized but lack depth—his motivation to archive patterns and relation to the glove remain underexplored, weakening emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Loose plot structure driven by atmospheric exploration rather than concrete progression; the cyclical focus on postcards and rain lacks narrative urgency or clear resolution within the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lush, immersive atmosphere with vivid sensory details (e.g., "damp earth and bruised apples") and cohesion between the enchanted grove’s eeriness and the protagonist’s quest.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elegant imagery and metaphor but undercut by diffuse subtext; the theme of emancipating natural patterns is intriguing yet underdeveloped, with emotional beats leaning on abstraction over "showing."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic tropes with inventive elements (sinister postcard doodles, borrowed memories) but occasionally veers toward poetic excess without a sharper narrative backbone.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Coherent but unevenly weighted—strong on mood and language, weaker on narrative architecture; the brevity feels more restrictive than purposeful, leaving ideas undercooked.</comment>
