<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character defined by menacing aura and gloves, but motivation to preserve 'hunting methods' feels vague and underexplored despite alignment with his shadowy methods.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot hinges on implied intrigue but lacks concrete progression; beginning and end lack clear causal linkage within tight word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sensory-rich setting (jasmine, paint thinner) creates immersive atmosphere, but labyrinth orchard’s strategic role feels inconsistently applied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (e.g., 'hunter in an orchard') elevate themes, but explicit exposition of 'demure audacity' weakens show-don’t-tell impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some phrases ('jaded locksmith,' 'delightfully menacing') lean on genre tropes. Tone avoids cliché but struggles with occasionally ornate prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Element integration is serviceable but uneven; the 'hunting methods' theme feels tacked on rather than organically guiding narrative choices.</comment>
