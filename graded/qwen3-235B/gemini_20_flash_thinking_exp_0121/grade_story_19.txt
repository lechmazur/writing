<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character is overly abstract, defined more by assigned traits than lived experience; motivation to 'embrace the unknown' feels tautological rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot structure implied rather than executed; the scale tilting east feels arbitrary, with no tangible consequence or transformation established in the resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Cohesion sacrificed for poetic flourish; elements function as checklist items rather than organically integrated narrative components.</comment>
