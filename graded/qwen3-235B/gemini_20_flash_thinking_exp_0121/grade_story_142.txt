<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Barely scratches surface of "realistically odd" character. Motivation is clear but thinly developed; actions lack psychological nuance. Legacy burden mentioned repeatedly but not embodied through meaningful internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot moves from point A to B but lacks tension or escalating stakes. Climbing coaster doesn't catalyze structural transformation. Symbols hinted but no concrete resolution or revelation earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rusted amusement park achieves immersive atmosphere through tactile decay details. "Phantom popcorn" and spectral duality enhance melancholia. Sensory cohesion elevates environmental storytelling.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Echo motifs and culinary symbolism create textural depth. Ending's "flicker of understanding" lacks payoff tension. Writing style is lush but occasionally obscures emotional immediacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but leans on gothic decay tropes without subversion. Some sensory details (e.g., "blurry vividness") feel pre-fabricated. Prose occasionally lapses into decorative overkill without earned metaphorical weight.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere technically but lack interplay sparking transcendent resonance. Premise shows creativity but execution remains at surface level. Lingering question: Why did this specific journey matter?</comment>
