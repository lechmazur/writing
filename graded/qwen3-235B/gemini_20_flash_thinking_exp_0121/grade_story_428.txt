<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Cardboard-character motivations (doubt, transformation) stated but unexplored; ink blotter interaction feels symbolic but shallow; "rarely authentic" trait contradicted by melodramatic introspection rather than demonstrated through action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Static plot masquerades as psychological depth; handshake as inciting incident lacks tangible stakes; repetitive circling of themes replaces narrative progression; ending doesn't resolve or recontextualize.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Incense/damp stone clich√©s create superficial atmosphere; temple described through adjectives rather than lived experience; lost opportunity to make setting an active participant in Elias' psychological unraveling.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Visionary language clashes with incoherent metaphors; "thrilling mix of fear/anticipation" tells rather than shows tension; star charts vs. blueprints contrast works conceptually but lacks visceral grounding.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Constellation trope recycled without subversion; overwritten descriptions ("daring caution, a necessary edge") betray human insight; prepper archetypes deployed without ironic deconstruction or originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Assembly of elements feels checklist-driven rather than organically integrated; verbose style obscures emotional truth; brief length exposes undercooked premise rather than focusing narrative potency.</comment>
