<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character is overly abstract, with motivation clear but psychologically flat; actions concept-driven, not deeply human; fails to deliver distinct voice beyond atmospheric descriptors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Pacing lacks urgency; plot structure resembles static mood piece rather than coherent arc; the assigned elements drive action but coherence falters in tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Detail-rich setting with evocative decay motifs, but sensory specifics remain narrowly visual; atmosphere and tone cohesive, yet atmospheric flourishes occasionally overshadow narrative function.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical use (e.g., braille as defiance of finality); emotional resonance leans intellectual over visceral; storytelling elegant but thin on human stakes or narrative tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Imaginative concept execution undercut by pretentious phrasing (e.g., "prickly wonder"); metaphors fresh but occasionally overwrought; maintains voice but lacks emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially, but story doesn't transcend collection of well-crafted parts; tone distinctive but self-consciously poetic; brevity works thematically but limits narrative weight.</comment>
