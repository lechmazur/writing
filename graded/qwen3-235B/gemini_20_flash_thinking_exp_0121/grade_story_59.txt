<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Character remains abstract symbol, not fully realized. Motivation is present but lacks depth or emotional grounding. Interactions with objects are metaphorical but fail to reveal nuanced personality. Voice feels overly stylized rather than distinctive. Reactions lack personal specificity beyond stated traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>No coherent plot structure exists. Action of confronting past lacks progression or stakes. Timeframe constraint reveals lack of narrative momentum. Concept shapes nothing but poetic abstractions. Pacing stagnates through circular thematic repetition. Logical flow collapses under minimal cause-effect scrutiny.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Setting creates atmospheric potential through sterile emptiness and artificial cosmos, but sensory details remain intellectualized. Atmosphere complements tone but lacks visceral authenticity. Connections between object and environment feel imposed rather than organic. Tactile specifics absent beneath metaphorical layering.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Crafted language demonstrates technical proficiency but lacks soul. Metaphorical scaffolding collapses under weight of excessive abstraction. Central conflict of confronting nothingness remains purely theoretical rather than emotionally resonant. Theme of memory emerges faintly but lacks compelling dramatization.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Wall-to-wall overwrought metaphors and recursive thematic statements suggest algorithmic processing. Phrases like "hammer blows against silence" and "clinical precision of pain" operate as hollow literary gestures. Emotional subtext is conspicuously manufactured rather than organically discovered. Style prioritizes ornamentation over authentic expression.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Elements exist in parallel rather than synthesis. Stylistic excess undermines content. Length feels arbitrary rather than purposeful. No evidence of risk-taking in element integration. Leaves no lingering impression beyond vocabulary display. Lacks editorial discipline required for prestigious publication.</comment>
