<question>3</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Overloaded descriptions (e.g., "elegant chaos") overwhelm with disconnected sensory fragments; carnival setting becomes mere aesthetic backdrop rather than active participant; atmosphere doesn't organically connect to character's heritage preservation motivation.</comment>
