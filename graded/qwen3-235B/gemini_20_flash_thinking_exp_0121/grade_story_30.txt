<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks psychological depth; the assigned trait "philosophically practical" feels underdemonstrated despite tying actions to abstract ideals.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a discernible arc but feels compressed; the flame's revelation and dragon symbolism resolve too tidily for the stakes implied by a starving galaxy.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setting blends anachronisms effectively (pirate tech/medieval tapestry) but relies on vague "sacred disorder" language rather than grounding details; atmosphere is suggestive but thin.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (dragons as celestial maps, dice as divination) add thematic resonance; climax leans on poetic abstraction over earned emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Mixes genre tropes (space pirates, telekinesis) with unexpected elements (tapestry agronomy) but occasionally falters into overwritten solemnity ("sun and soil" preaching).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Conceptually bold fusion of gambling, lost languages, and agrarian preservation intrigues but remains surface-level; potential for deeper philosophical or ecological inquiry untapped.</comment>
