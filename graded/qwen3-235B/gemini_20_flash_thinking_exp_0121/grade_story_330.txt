<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character's arc relies on stated emotions rather than nuanced reactions; motivation is clear but inconsistently embodied in actions beyond reciting the vow.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Pacing compresses emotional beats, but the vow-driven structure creates coherence; abrupt shifts between abstract metaphors and narrative weaken flow.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Setting relies on paradoxical descriptors ("normally abnormal") without embedding the reader in tangible sensory experience or explaining how environment shapes action.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (trident, horizons) adds thematic depth, but overly ornate phrasing occasionally dilutes emotional resonance; ending satisfies the arc but lacks subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Languid phrases ("nascent dawn," "forgotten paths") recur formulaically; metaphors are not subverted or specific enough to avoid clich√© or AI-generated feel.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Assigned elements are present but feel checklist-driven rather than organically integrated; the story leans on poetic abstraction over narrative cohesion.</comment>
