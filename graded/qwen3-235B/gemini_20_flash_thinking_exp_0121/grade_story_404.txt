<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological depth; motivations (crushing hope to capture cosmic events) feel externally imposed rather than organic. "Wandering monk" label adds little substance. Emotional stakes remain abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but feels artificial, with action sequences disconnected from character psychology. Melody collection lacks procedural logic or rising tension. Resolution feels arbitrarily imposed rather than earned narratively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmospheric details (ozone scent, temporal flux) create vivid sensory immersion, but setting's multiversal chaos doesn't meaningfully intersect with character's internal conflict or thematic elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Effective imagery and cosmic symbolism present, but emotional resonance remains superficial. Thematic exploration of broken trust and cosmic indifference lacks sufficient narrative grounding or emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Original concept of "haunted melodies" stands out, but execution falls into clich√©d melancholia through overused metaphors ("echoes of emotions," "spectral symphony"). Character logic feels algorithmically generated rather than human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story functions as an aesthetic object but lacks narrative urgency. Elements serve as literary puzzle pieces rather than organic components. Leaves no profound lingering impression despite cosmic themes.</comment>
