<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character exists more as symbol than person; motivations are stated but lack psychological complexity, and the "sneering" trait doesn't manifest through concrete actions or dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot mimics circularity of obsession rather than traditional structure; repetitive searching action lacks rising tension, and the "hush of a possibility" timeframe creates vague rather than cohesive temporal logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Alien plain and decaying greenhouse create immersive, contradictory environment (barren vitality), though excessive focus on crystalline soil and phantom fragrances occasionally veers into ornamental abstraction.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Metaphors ("cup starlight in mortal palms") and cosmic imagery elevate craft but sometimes substitute for structural momentum, while "rambling destiny" theme remains more atmospheric than dramatically embodied.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Phrases like "swirling leaves" and "tempest of ambition" recur mechanistically, with abstract poeticizing replacing organic detail; attempts at subtext (paper trails as historical records) feel underdeveloped, resembling algorithmically generated "profound" prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elements are layered like collage rather than woven into narrative tissue; the vineyard setting and destiny motif create coherence but many components (sneering envoy's cynicism, "furiously tranquil" paradox) remain decorative rather than generative.</comment>
