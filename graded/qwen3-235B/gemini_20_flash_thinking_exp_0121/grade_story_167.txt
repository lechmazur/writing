<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but lacks nuanced exploration of her inner conflict between duty and rebellion; her actions align with her goal yet her personality remains surface-level beyond determination.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight arc within constraints; the coil activation drives progression, but the abrupt shift to "contamination" lacks gradual tension; cause/effect between action and temporal disruption is logical yet underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Visually immersive atmosphere with sensory details (stale air, temporal hum), but the "liminal spaces between moments" concept feels underdeveloped; tone of restrained urgency complements themes but lacks deeper integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Echoes as metaphor effectively convey themes; ending lacks resolution but purposefully leans into lingering impact; "earthbound flight" adds poetic tension, though emotional resonance is diluted by over-reliance on abstract phrasing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original concept with fresh integration of time-as-water motifs; avoids clich√©s but occasionally slips into ornate phrasing ("charged air of revelation"); character logic leans overly cerebral with minimal emotional texture.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically, though pacing feels constrained by word limit; tone is distinct but risks obscuring emotional stakes; leaves conceptual imprint but lacks visceral engagement beyond intellectual appeal.</comment>
