<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character's hesitation is thematically present but lacks psychological complexity; internal conflict is abstract rather than visceral. Motivation remains nebulous despite poetic allusions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot exists as a static ritual rather than dynamic progression; repetitive focus on footsteps creates circularity rather than development. Resolution feels like an echo rather than progression.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere cohesive but thematically diffuse; poetic resonance compensates for thin narrative thread. Conceptual ambition exceeds structural execution.</comment>
