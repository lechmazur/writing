<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Character lacks internal conflict or development beyond static tropes of solitude; motivations are stated but not deeply explored through action or interaction, reducing plausibility.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Narrative loops on a single action (repositioning) without progression; the constrained word limit exacerbates the absence of a clear arc or resolution, leaving the story suspended.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on generic "ancient castle" and "art school" descriptors; sparse sensory details fail to create a vividly immersive, differentiated world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors (flowers as cosmic language) elevate the story, but excessive exposition about emotions weakens the "show, don't tell" principle; ending feels conceptually unresolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</comment><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements are competently synthesized but lack transformative cohesion; the story’s brevity works thematically but sacrifices narrative momentum and emotional payoff.</comment>
