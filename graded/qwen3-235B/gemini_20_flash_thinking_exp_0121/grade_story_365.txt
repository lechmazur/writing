<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Stylized descriptions substitute for true character depth; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through tangible choices; the contradiction between "deflated" and "independently dependent" remains abstract rather than shaping concrete behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Static circular structure relies heavily on poetic repetition rather than narrative progression; the action of rope-weaving lacks concrete consequences despite vivid imagery; atmosphere dominates over plot momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Richly textured subconscious carnival setting merges symbolic objects with atmospheric decay; sensory details organically emerge from conceptual elements rather than feeling imposed as checklist items.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors (history as tapestry, memory as perfume) elevate the piece, but emotional resonance remains distant; the central conflict of rewriting time remains conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Avoids typical traps like dialogue and overt clich√©s but occasionally substitutes ornate description for emotional authenticity; the "melancholic glee" tone feels more curatorial than organically sustained.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Highly cohesive within its surreal constraints but sacrifices narrative urgency for atmospheric density; length feels restrictive rather than deliberate; style impresses more than substance moves.</comment>
