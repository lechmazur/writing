<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character traits are symbolically established but lack psychological depth; motivations are clear yet remain primarily abstract rather than embodied through specific memories or actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot progression hinges on internal realization rather than external action; the narrative arc is logical but leans heavily on introspective pacing rather than dynamic structural shifts within the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting evokes visceral atmosphere through precise sensory details like "crushing waves" and "rusted chains"; the lighthouse prison's physicality effectively mirrors the knight's internal confinement and desolation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Relies on strong metaphoric framework (stone/chains/flower) and lyrical descriptions, but emotional resonance is undercut by excessive abstract phrasing rather than tangible character behavior or dialogue.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is diluted by familiar redemption arcs and emotionally heavy descriptors ("joyful agony") that feel conceptually ambitious but stylistically overwrought; avoids outright clich√©s through inventive object symbolism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements like the brass knocker and waterlogged flower integrate thematically, though the mirrored reflection framing device feels underutilized; prose prioritizes mood over narrative innovation despite constrained length.</comment>
