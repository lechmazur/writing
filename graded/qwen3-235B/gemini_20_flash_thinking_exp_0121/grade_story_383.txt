<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically via the general's actions, but the tight frame strains the transition from isolation to collective hope; resolution feels abrupt despite thematic linkage.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative (dark matter diner, galaxy-eyed waitress) but underutilized; setting’s connection to themes remains superficial, lacking immersive sensory cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (dark matter as anxiety, seaweed as renewal) and symbolic interplay between photographs and art create layered meaning; dialogue feels slightly stilted but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh sci-fi emotional resonance; some phrases ("rational absurdity") risk overabstraction, but the seaweed/art concept avoids cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere structurally but sacrifice depth for brevity; the story prioritizes thematic elegance over narrative complexity, leaving lingering emotional stakes untapped.</comment>
