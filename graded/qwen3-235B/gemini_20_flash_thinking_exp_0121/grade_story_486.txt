<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Weak internal conflict; motivation to silence the crowd lacks psychological depth, though "clumsily dexterous" trait is physically manifested but underserved in emotional context.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure but strained causality in how sound manipulates the crowd; pacing is efficient but relies too heavily on unexplained magical effects.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere from sensory details (dust, potions, stained glass) effectively grounds the supernatural, though the witch's cauldron room's purpose feels partially disconnected from the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong symbolism in stained glass and erased chalkboard; conceptually intriguing but lacks emotional resonance beyond the immediate narrative's intellectual appeal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s with "sound-as-magic" subversion, but stained glass fragment and pantomime confessions risk feeling like curated eccentricities rather than organic worldbuilding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere mechanically but not thematically; the story leans on its concepts to carry weight rather than letting deeper ideas emerge organically from character or setting.</comment>
