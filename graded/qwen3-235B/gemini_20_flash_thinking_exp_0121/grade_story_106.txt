<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivation (escaping dead end) is clear and consistent with assigned traits like sullenness and borrowed valor, but Barnaby's sudden transformation could use more psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot has clear arc from despair to inspiration, but pacing feels slightly rushed in transitioning from stamps/quilt observation to decisive action without intermediate struggle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid bioluminescent algae and underwater decay create strong visuals, but the power station setting lacks deeper integration beyond atmospheric backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (stamps=portals, quilt=map) reinforce theme effectively; ending achieves satisfying thematic resonance by connecting personal artifact to existential longing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements interconnect cohesively, though some (like objectively biased descriptor) feel included by checklist rather than narrative necessity; ending lingers as quiet hope rather than explosive revelation.</comment>
