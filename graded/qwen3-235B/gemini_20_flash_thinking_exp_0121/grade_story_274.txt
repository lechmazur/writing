<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Characterization of Agnes as a sentient plant with "apathetically devoted" traits is consistent, though the shift toward curiosity feels underexplored. Motivation emerges subtly through environmental interactions but lacks visceral depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot progresses by Agnes’s decision to move, but pacing drags in middle traversal. The arc (apathy to curiosity) exists but feels truncated. Cause-effect logic holds, yet episodic structure weakens cohesion in the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting details (dust motes, drive-in decay) evoke mood, though sensory immersion remains superficial. Atmosphere aligns with ambivalence, but the drive-in’s potential as symbolic space is hinted rather than fully realized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., sentient plant as artistic stagnation) and symbolic objects enrich subtext. Emotional resonance is muted; the ending’s quiet curiosity avoids cliché but lacks punch. Theme of dormant potential is clear but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in premise and tone. Avoids overt tropes (e.g., anthropomorphic plant comedy), opting for existential ennui. Prose balances lyricism and restraint, though occasional abstract phrasing ("scalding ambivalence") risks vagueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story coheres but feels constrained by formulaic structural beats. Combines elements inventively (e.g., bookmark as bridge between Elias’s stories and Agnes’s quest) but sacrifices emotional urgency for melancholic brevity.</comment>
