<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Clear motivation (preservation of craftsmanship) but repetitive self-contradictory phrasing undermines depth; actions are thematic but lack concrete examples of his craft-protecting work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Static structure with no cause-effect progression; begins and ends with identical existential dread without narrative evolution, relying on circular repetition rather than plot development.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Elements present but superficially integrated; high-concept potential undermined by stylistic redundancy and static storytelling that doesn't transcend prescribed components.</comment>
