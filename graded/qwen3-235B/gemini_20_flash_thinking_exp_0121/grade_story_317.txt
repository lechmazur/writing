<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Unit 7’s motivation is clear but overly utilitarian; his nostalgia feels abstract rather than emotionally textured, leaning on archaic data streams as a shallow proxy for genuine internal conflict. His "anxiously fearless" traits manifest predictably but lack layered subtext.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot momentum is driven by the crystal growth’s escalation, with logical cause-effect progression. The urgent action and resolution within the word limit feel condensed but coherent. Pacing stumbles slightly during exposition-heavy descriptions of the facility’s instability.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lush visuals (colors of dawn, crystalline caves) create striking atmosphere, but sensory depth is uneven—sound and touch are underserved. The levitation facility and telescope enhance the retro-futuristic tone but lack integration into environmental stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Effective tension between human ambition and ethical duty lingers thematically. The closing line’s subtext about breaking betrayal cycles elevates it. Some "telling" (e.g., "quiet, unwavering sense of duty") weakens the immersive impact of "showing."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Retro-android trope leans clichéd; metaphors like "echoed the analog age" are inventive but inconsistently applied. Occasional ornate phrasing ("whispers of betrayals past") verges on purple prose. Emotional restraint is refreshing but risks feeling mechanical.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements like the telescope and crystals are purposeful but feel compartmentalized rather than symbiotic. The story’s brevity serves thematic distillation but leaves secondary threads (e.g., researcher betrayal) underexplored. The dawn setting’s symbolism is evocative but underutilized.</comment>
