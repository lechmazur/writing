<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Unit 7's "merry bitterness" is stated but not deeply demonstrated through actions; motivation to anchor anxieties exists but lacks emotional nuance or evolving realization; collective dialogue lacks distinct voices beyond tonal variation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Plot stagnates in atmospheric inertia; wax-dripping rituals repeat without escalating stakes or resolution; the "bold discovery" remains abstract, leaving the narrative without a satisfying arc despite attempts at cyclical structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (flickering shadows, melting wax scent) immerse readers, but the "uniformly peculiar" secret agent facility feels underutilized; setting leans on generic "eccentric" tropes rather than forging a cohesive, logic-driven world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (wax patterns as subconscious, charger plug as broken connection) show promise but remain static; ending lacks thematic payoff; the "sound of hindsight" concept is intriguing but underdeveloped, preventing deeper resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Over-relies on abstract, flowery phrases ("thrumming beneath their shared consciousness") and pseudo-profound juxtapositions ("merry bitterness"); inconsistent emotional subtext feels artificial; avoids clichés but substitutes them with vague, affected surrealism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Elements superficially cohere but lack narrative urgency; reliance on atmospheric abstraction feels like evasion rather than intentionality; the story’s "lingering" effect stems from confusion, not depth.</comment>
