<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Monk’s motivation (lost languages) drives actions, but psychological depth lacks—no internal conflict or evolution. The mismatched buttons symbolize fragmented knowledge but aren’t tied to tangible character stakes. "Timidly loud" voice is evocative but inconsistently utilized in behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is cyclical, not arc-driven—begins/ends with monk’s ritual but lacks progression. Fairy tale references as method skim cause-effect logic. Pacing lingers on atmosphere over momentum; storm HQ framing device feels underexploited narratively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Radar screens vs. tactile buttons juxtaposition creates visceral contrast. Sensory details (parchment-rustle voice, humming servers) immerse but occasionally overadorn. Timeframe’s "silent wonder" evokes historical weight, grounding the monk’s mission in eerie transcendence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (buttons as Rosetta Stones) resonate, but theme—reviving dead languages via non-traditional means—lacks philosophical tension. Ending achieves quiet triumph without earned catharsis. Nuanced "showing" of obsession outweighs telling, though subtext remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes ("whispers lost to time") border on cliché. "Forgotten dance" motif feels archetypal, not fresh. Emotional abstraction (e.g., "humming with untold stories") prioritizes poetics over authentic urgency. Premise subverts linguistics tropes but leans on monk/scholar archetype.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements converge thematically but not narratively—allusions outweigh plot. The brief form highlights concept over completion; storm HQ’s presence raises unmet questions. Lingering impression leans on poetic abstraction, not emotional resonance or conceptual revelation.</comment>
