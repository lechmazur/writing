<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's profession as puppeteer is underused; motivation for "truth" is abstract but drives actions. Lacks distinct voice or behavior reflecting his occupation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot hinges on symbolic connections that feel intellectually satisfying but lack narrative momentum. Logical gaps in how elements coalesce; pacing is contemplative rather than event-driven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with sensory details (mustiness, texture contrasts) and solitude. Timeframe/set enhance mood, though ancient setting's relevance feels superficial.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</comment>Story evokes introspection about meaning in imperfection. Metaphors are poetic but occasionally vague. Ending satisfies thematic arc but lacks emotional urgency.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Originality in linking stamps/gown tears to "truth," but prose occasionally verges on ornate abstraction. Avoids clich√©s but leans on lyrical ambiguity over concrete stakes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but occasionally forced. Style complements tone; length constraints limit narrative texture but amplify the abstract focus. Leaves thematic resonance rather than visceral impact.</comment>
