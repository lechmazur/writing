<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character traits like "morbid" and "neutrally passionate" are stated but minimally demonstrated through specific actions; motivations tied to cosmic understanding feel abstract rather than deeply personal or emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Linear progression fulfills the plot but lacks surprises; pacing is deliberate yet slightly rushed in connecting inciting incident to resolution; cause-effect logic is clear but not innovatively structured.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Evocative descriptions of dust, aged paper, and candlelight create a vivid, immersive atmosphere; "floating rock dojo" adds surreal tension but its conceptual weight feels underutilized in the narrative stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Metaphors like cosmic cycles mirroring life/death are thought-provoking but surface-level; ending achieves thematic resonance without emotional gut-punch; symbolism coherent but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but some descriptors ("neutrally passionate") lean abstract; atmosphere feels genuinely crafted, though character psychology occasionally prioritizes conceptual ideas over human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements are competently woven together but occasionally feel checklist-driven; the brief format is used effectively for mood but sacrifices deeper character or philosophical exploration.</comment>
