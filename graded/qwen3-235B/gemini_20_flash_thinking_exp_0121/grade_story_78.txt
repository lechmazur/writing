<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivations are clear but underdeveloped; inner conflict remains superficial, with traits like "softly militant" stated more than embodied through nuanced behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Linear progression toward decision feels inevitable but too condensed; emotional beats and plot momentum are compromised by compressed pacing and lack of tangible obstacles.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through tactile decay and claustrophobic desolation, but the post-apocalyptic setting's rules and societal mechanics remain frustratingly vague.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("green island amidst the grey ruins") and existential themes elevate the narrative, though emotional beats often rely on poetic abstraction over visceral specificity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Some phrases ("gravity of loss," "reluctant awe") ring archetypal, while "softly militant" injects fresh tension; near-cliche apocalyptic imagery countered by the rooftop farm's original symbolism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements superficially cohere but lack organic synergy; the story's ambition exceeds its brevity, leaving concepts underexplored while maintaining sufficient emotional gravity.</comment>
