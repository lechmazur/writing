<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but underdeveloped; his rebelliousness lacks tangible demonstration, and the absence of dialogue or inner monologue weakens depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot progresses through observation mechanics but lacks substantial conflict or resolution; looping structure undermines narrative progression within the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but lack narrative urgency; the closing "stirring in the soil" hints at potential rather than fulfillment.</comment>
