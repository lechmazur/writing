<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting and sensory details (serpent skull fortress, desert tension) create vivid atmosphere. Tonal contrast between oppressive reality and ephemeral art strengthens thematic impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (rosary vs. sand art) and subtext about impermanence enrich the narrative. Ending feels emotionally satisfying but lacks lingering complexity.</comment>
