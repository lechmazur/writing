<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's internal conflict is present but often told rather than shown; her transformation feels somewhat rushed despite anchoring the narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but relies on abrupt transitions (storm, seedling's growth); the arc resolves logically yet feels slightly compressed for emotional weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s with its bunker/herbalist premise and subdued tone but occasionally slips into ornate phrasing (e.g., "hushed turbulence") that feels strained.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements combine into a thematically cohesive narrative about limitation fostering creativity, though some assigned components feel more integral than others.</comment>
