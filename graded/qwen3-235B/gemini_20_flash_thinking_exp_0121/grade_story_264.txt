<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Alchemist trait feels metaphorical rather than deeply integrated; motivation is clear but lacks emotional underpinnings; actions align with concept but character voice remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has internal cohesion and clear arc but uses word limit unevenly; transitions between stadium and station disrupt momentum; method drives the narrative but feels conceptually rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting details (flickering projector, celestial charts) create strong sensory atmosphere; shooting star station feels underexploited; "touched sky" concept blends well with tone but lacks temporal specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (cracked lens mirroring constellations) add symbolic resonance; theme of wonder vs. cynicism is compellingly rendered; ending lingers but emotional impact remains diffuse rather than piercing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but "hauntingly cheerful" borders on oxymoronic overcrafting; alchemical characterization risks feeling decorative; metaphors are specific but some sensory descriptions verge on generic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>All elements incorporated with logical unity; brief length serves poetic conceit rather than hindering; tone/style serve thematic purpose; leaves contemplative residue about perception of cosmic intimacy.</comment>
