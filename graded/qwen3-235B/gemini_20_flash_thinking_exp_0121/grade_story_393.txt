<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character remains superficially sketched; motivations (desperation, hope) are present but lack psychological depth. Profession as alchemist influences setting more than internal logic or decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear trajectory but relies heavily on contrived coincidence. Pacing manages tight word limit well, though some transitions (e.g. butterfly emergence timing) feel forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Overreliance on adjective-heavy descriptions ("stark against the horizon," "skeletal sentinels") undermines atmospheric cohesion. Sensory details mostly superficial rather than immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Strong symbolic framework (butterfly, tar pit) and layered metaphors suggest deeper meaning. Ending achieves thematic resonance despite somewhat predictable resolution of character motivation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Minimal purple prose and deliberate stylistic choices. Avoids most formulaic traps through specific imagery and controlled thematic ambiguity, though coincidence-driven plot risks slight predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Heterogeneous element integration; some components (tar pit watchtowers) feel externally imposed rather than organically developed. Style serves content but occasional abstraction weakens narrative cohesion.</comment>
