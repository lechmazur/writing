<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Static portrayal of surly demeanor; motivation for cosmic understanding is stated but underdeveloped. Lack of internal conflict weakens characterization despite atmospheric context.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Meandering exploration of cosmic patterns dominates; riddle's resolution provides minimal forward momentum. Vignette structure sacrifices full arc development despite symbolic symmetry between yarn and tide.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Evocative maritime decay permeates; sensory details (cold stones, bone-chip wind) create immersive liminality. Timeframe between seasons masterfully mirrors protagonist's existential stasis.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphoric richness in "current" revelation; cosmic symbolism elevates narrative. Lacks sustained emotional tension in brief exploration of profound metaphysical themes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes but occasionally drifts into poetic abstraction. Human nuance in Silas' obsession lacks complexity; atmospheric elements consistently strong.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Well-crafted but niche execution; elements combine cleverly but create fragmented emotional impact. Achieves thematic resonance within format constraints, lacks urgent universality.</comment>
