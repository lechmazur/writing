<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological depth; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through specific actions/reactions. The "meandering" quality feels underexplored in behavior patterns. Assigned traits ("ordinarily extraordinary") remain ambiguously defined. Dialogue absent, so voice evaluation impossible.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot achieves basic circularity (bookstore discovery → societal impact) but relies on montage-like progression without significant conflict or stakes. The dentures' agency is underdeveloped; "sowing" remains abstract. Pacing feels compressed rather than purposefully tight. Cause-effect relationships exist but lack emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mountain bookstore's tactile descriptions (chill air/dusty folklore corners) and sensory contrasts (warm dentures vs. cold world) create compelling atmosphere. Seedy bars' "clinking glasses" and "dim light" effectively ground subversive performances. Timeframe device ("pregnant pause of regret") cleverly anchors ephemeral modernity within ancient setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ember-rekindling metaphor and "fractured idyll" concept create thematic resonance. Literary devices (e.g., "whispered stories from bookstore pages") elegantly reinforce themes without overstatement. Ending's textual reference provides contemporary irony but feels tacked on rather than organically connected to character journey.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes through unusual combinations (dentures as magical objects, subversive puppetry). Some phrases ("aching heart," "seeds of warmth") border on cliché. Emotional responses are shown through gestures ("flickering smiles") rather than explicitly stated. Writing style maintains consistent voice without excessive ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>All elements present but unevenly integrated. Dentures and bookstore function as strong anchors; "meandering" character trait feels underutilized. Brief length works for vignette quality but sacrifices narrative complexity. Closing connection to apologetic texts is clever yet feels gimmicky rather than thematically essential.</comment>
