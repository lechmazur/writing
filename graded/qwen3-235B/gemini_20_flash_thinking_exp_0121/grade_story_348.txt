<question>1</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Character remains abstract and undefined beneath poetic descriptions; motivations feel imposed by concept rather than organically developed through specific actions or internal contradictions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Lacks structural progression - functions more as a static mood piece than a story with narrative momentum, logical cause-effect, or meaningful resolution within constraints.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Excessive ornate phrasing and repetitive "whispering woods" motif suggest algorithmic pattern generation; lacks human-nuanced emotional complexity despite clever conceptual framing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Coexists with elements mechanically rather than organically; stylistic choices overwhelm narrative purpose; brevity feels like limitation, not artistic choice.</comment>
