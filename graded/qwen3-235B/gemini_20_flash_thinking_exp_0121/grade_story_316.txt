<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Weak alignment between timid attribute and decisive actions; promise motivates but lacks layered emotional nuance; some symbolic connection to objects but voice remains soft-focused.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot structure hinges on abstract leap from scoreboard analysis to collective healing; pacing condensed to vagueness; thematic throughline survives but lacks causal momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elegiac atmosphere crystallizes loss; sensory details (dust, decay) immerse effectively; Greek temple adds mythic undertone but underutilized narratively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</comment>Evocative metaphors (tapestry, scattered harmony) enrich theme; over-reliance on poetic abstraction dilutes emotional immediacy; ending feels conceptually closed yet incomplete.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes occasionally override clarity ("digital hieroglyphs"); avoids clich√©s but borders on pretension; emotional subtext implied rather than crystallized through action.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements function symbolically but strain credibility (scoreboard-as-healing-key); cohesion achieved through tone over logic; thematic ambition exceeds narrative payoff.</comment>
