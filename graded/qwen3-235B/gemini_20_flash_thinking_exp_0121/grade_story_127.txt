<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but lacks deeper exploration of how guilt manifests beyond surface actions; emotional complexity hinted but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear trigger-to-resolution arc, but pacing feels slightly rushed in emotional transitions and lacks nuanced cause-and-effect progression.</comment>
