<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Character's nostalgic tailoring is underdeveloped; motivation to transcend lacks visceral connection to his profession. Internal conflict remains abstract despite lyrical introspection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a circular meditation rather than dramatic arc. Tension between mortal limits and transcendence exists but lacks concrete progression or stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Storm dynamics and steampunk decay create immersive atmosphere. Sensory overload occasionally overshadows narrative purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (threads, weaving) resonate thematically. Emotional impact diluted by over-reliance on poetic abstraction vs. earned human truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids outright clich√©s but leans on established sci-fi tropes (parallel lives, code-breaking). Some purple prose detracts from deeper philosophical inquiry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Polished concept piece with striking images. Fails to fully transcend genre trappings or provoke existential reflection beyond surface metaphorical play.</comment>
