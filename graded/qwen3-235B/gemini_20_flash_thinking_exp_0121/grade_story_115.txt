<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but underdeveloped; her internal conflict is stated rather than felt. Actions align with her role as a tinkerer, but emotional nuance and distinctive voice are lacking.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pacing manages tight constraints, but the plot hinges on abstract concepts without concrete stakes. The mask's use as a conduit lacks logical grounding, weakening cause-effect relationships.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setting details exist but lack vivid, sensory integration. The nano-scale city's logic isn't meaningfully connected to the mask's energy or the timeframe, missing opportunities for atmospheric cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The metaphor of interconnected wishes is intriguing but under-executed. The ending hints at thematic resonance about collective intent but lacks emotional payoff. Subtext remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids most clich√©s with the plague mask and nano-city concept. Some phrases ("ruminative exasperation") repeat unnaturally, and emotional states are often told rather than shown. Style balances clarity with occasional flourish.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but unevenly integrated. The tight word count obscures deeper thematic cohesion. Lingering conceptual questions outweigh immediate emotional impact.</comment>
