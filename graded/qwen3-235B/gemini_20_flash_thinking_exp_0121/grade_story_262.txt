<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character defined by assigned traits (impulse, "righteously flawed" approach), but lacks psychological complexity; motivation to rescue knowledge drives plot but remains abstract without concrete stakes or earned emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Static progression across concerts with no tangible escalation or resolution; reliance on repetitive imagery weakens narrative momentum; structure prioritizes atmosphere over plot development.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Echoing Roman bathhouse and organ create evocative visuals, but sensory details remain fragmented; the setting’s historical weight isn’t fully integrated with the alien’s mission or emotional subtext.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Mixes poetic phrasing with overwritten descriptions; theme of fear-as-shackle is potent but under-explored; lacks sharp focus in balancing metaphor with character-driven narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Avoids most clichés through unique premise (alien-teacher, resonant organ method), but relies on vague emotional descriptors ("fierce tenderness") and repetitive rhetorical patterns that obscure deeper character insight.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elements coexist without interlocking; the bathhouse and organ feel conceptually rich but narratively inert; thematic ambition outpaces execution, leaving an impression of unmet potential.</comment>
