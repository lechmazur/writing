<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lack of psychological depth; motivations stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced behavior. Character's arcane actions lack humanizing contradictions or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ephemeral plot progression; vague progression between encounters. Coherence sacrificed for poetic imagery without clear narrative logic or resolution within tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid contrasts between sterile modernity and mystical elements. Sensory details (cold fragment pulse, glass patterns) create immersive tension but underdeveloped spatial logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</comment><comment>Strained metaphors ("sanctified dread") and unfocused themes. Atmosphere evokes unease but lacks emotional anchoring or clear symbolic through-line.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Reliance on gothic clich√©s (ancient artifacts, mirrors as portals) dressed in modern setting. Overly ornate descriptions mask hollow emotional scaffolding typical of algorithmic patterning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Eclectic elements coexist superficially rather than synergize. Narrative prioritizes aesthetic juxtapositions over thematic cohesion or lasting resonance beyond initial strangeness.</comment>
