<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's core trait of factually imaginative is demonstrated but lacks depth; motivation to preserve recipes is clear but insufficiently layered into actions beyond surface-level determination.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cohesive arc from discovery to hidden compartment exists, but pacing stumbles under word constraints; hopscotch-guided interrogation feels rushed despite clever setup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Archive atmosphere is evocatively rendered with sensory details (snow, dust, faded ink), creating a mournful tension that mirrors the protagonist's emotional state.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphor-rich storytelling elevates preservation theme; subtext about cultural memory resonates through symbolism like melting snowflakes and pulsing hopscotch squares.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic structures but occasionally slips into ornate phrasing ("mournful elation" recurs excessively); hopscotch revelation borders on convenient.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements interwoven effectively, though some (hopscotch's "secret patterns") strain credibility; brevity sacrifices deeper exploration of protagonist's internal conflict.</comment>
