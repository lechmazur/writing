<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character traits (ruthless florist, intellectually spontaneous) influence her methods but feel loosely connected to practical actions. Motivation to decode rock art through conversation is original but underexplored. The plastic comb interaction highlights her tactile approach, but the "ruthless" aspect remains superficial.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>No clear plot progression—relies on internal monologue and atmosphere. The method of decoding through imagined conversations creates thematic cohesion but lacks narrative momentum. Pacing is static, with the ending feeling abrupt and unresolved.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stone circle setting and "pause between verses" timeframe establish mood effectively. Sensory details about lichen and stone texture enhance immersion, but the "polite anarchy" tone is stated more than demonstrated. Atmosphere complements the theme but lacks layered complexity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (comb as dialogue tool, floral design parallels to decoding art) elevate the narrative. Themes of connecting across time resonate, but emotional impact is diluted by excessive introspection and lack of external stakes. Writing style balances lyricism and clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids clichéd tropes through quirky pairing of floristry with archaeology. Some phrases ("heightened awareness") lean generic. Emotional nuance emerges in her imagined conversations but is undercut by over-reliance on abstract concepts. Originality in premise outpaces execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically (comb, stone circle, spontaneous thinking) but struggle with narrative integration. The short form feels intentional, prioritizing mood over plot. Leverages creative juxtapositions but sacrifices depth for brevity. Lingering questions about character’s methods lack resolution.</comment>
