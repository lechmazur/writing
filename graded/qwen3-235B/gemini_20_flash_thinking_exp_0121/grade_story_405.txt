<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Weak integration of gambling history; grief motivation feels abstract despite petals. Minimal emotional revelation; character voice diluted by excessive context explanation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot forward momentum exists but resolution feels abrupt. Cryptic scrawl mechanism drives action but lacks temporal stakes; narrative compression creates cohesion gaps in motivation shifts.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mushroom farm atmosphere is visceral but subway-seat element underdeveloped. Recipe testing timeframe serves as arbitrary plot device rather than enhancing setting logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Grief-as-navigation system concept intellectually engaging; some effective symbolic layering (mushrooms = unspoken emotions). Emotional resonance remains surface-level despite poetic language.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Original fusion of fungal horror and urban myth; avoids full cliche through biochemical specificity. Purple prose avoided but contains occasional stock phrases ("heart of darkness" derivatives).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story possesses haunting architectural qualities but sacrifices character depth for conceptual density; elements like recipe testing and gambling remain decorative rather than thematic.</comment>
