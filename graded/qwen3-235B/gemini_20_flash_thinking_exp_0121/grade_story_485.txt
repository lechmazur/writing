<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character has depth and internal conflict, but motivations (raider suddenly seeking preservation) feel insufficiently earned. Nuanced duality exists but lacks foundational context.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Clear but rushed three-act structure within tight word count. Cause-effect logic holds, but pacing stumbles during emotional transitions. Coherence maintained with minor gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive setting with strong sensory details. Fractured grace tone consistently conveyed through environmental decay. Social upheaval context remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (charcoal motifs) and layered themes. Ending resonates with melancholic hope, but emotional beats occasionally undercut by over-explanation rather than subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Avoids most AI pitfalls with specific imagery, but contains purple prose ("symphony of lost innovation"). Childhood superstition angle shows ingenuity but relies on familiar tropes without deep subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere functionally but lack transcendent integration. Brief format feels limiting rather than purposeful. Surface-level thematic unity without lasting visceral impact or intellectual provocation.</comment>
