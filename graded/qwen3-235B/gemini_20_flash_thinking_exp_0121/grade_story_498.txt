<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Limited emotional nuance despite clear motivation; nervousness is stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced behavior. The kingpin title feels underutilized in shaping concrete actions or conflicts. Conceptual motivation is articulated but lacks lived-in complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot moves logically from plan to execution but lacks concrete conflict progression within tight word limit. The detour-as-method remains abstract rather than dramatized action; no tangible stakes escalate.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Wintry isolation masterfully reinforces xenophobia and fragility of hope. Sensory details (burlap, frozen earth, "restless hush") create vivid atmosphere. Landmark lacks material significance beyond titular function.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (seeds/thawing) carry thematic weight; language balances lyricism and purpose. Emotional impact is subdued rather than visceral; ending leans on hope clich√©s without earned resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-writing traps with fresh phrasing but occasionally slips into abstract moralizing ("tyranny of indifference"). Subverts "outsider savior" trope by making tool (seeds) and goal (gardens) communal rather than individualistic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but feel more assembled than organically integrated. The framework's constraints are visible in underdeveloped action sequences and philosophical over-explanation.</comment>
