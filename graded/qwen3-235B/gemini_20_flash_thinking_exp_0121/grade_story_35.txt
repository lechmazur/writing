<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's quietude shapes actions but lacks layered motivations; emotional reactions inferred through objects more than internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot flows from discovery to resolution but rushes the retreat's emotional weight; cohesive but underdeveloped transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sonic flora and tactile details immerse readers, but the translation center's purpose remains superficially symbolic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Skillful metaphors (e.g., “language of emotions”) are undercut by occasional abstract telling; ending resonates thematically.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but teeters on trope edges (e.g., silent retreat); lush prose occasionally obscures nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a poignant fragment, but underdeveloped concepts (e.g., “regularly random”) and uneven pacing limit impact.</comment>
