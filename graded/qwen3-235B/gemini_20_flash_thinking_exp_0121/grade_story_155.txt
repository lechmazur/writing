<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Motivation lacks thematic weight, traits minimally shape actions; character's voice blends into prose rather than asserting individuality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Pacing uneven; plot lacks resolution or clear arc despite atmospheric momentum; causal links between unraveling/time anomalies and character actions remain superficial.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory immersion, but planetarium-turned-club’s potential is underutilized; setting’s connection to the box’s temporal function feels unexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (hull breach as emotional premonition) anchor the story; thematic coherence falters in the rushed, ambiguous ending.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Refreshingly original concept, but clichéd phrasing ("pressure before a hull breach") and under-developed time-crossing mechanics hint at formulaic shortcuts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</question><grade>Idea-rich but execution-light; elements coexist without fully intersecting; brevity hinders thematic depth rather than enhancing it.</comment>
