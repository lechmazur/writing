<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Pixel’s jumpy, bizarre traits are present but underexplored; his motivation to unmask the icon drives action but lacks psychological depth or nuanced internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from discovery to resolution, with cause-effect clarity, but the condensed arc feels slightly rushed, lacking gradual tension buildup in the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong sensory cohesion in pixelated worldbuilding; glitched walls, glowing fishhook, and shifting paint drips vividly immerse the reader, though the "old gods" element feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Themes of truth vs. propaganda and rebellion resonate, with symbolic elements (fishhook as truth, mural as erased history). Dialogue absent; subtext sometimes overt, weakening nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés via pixelated metaphors (digital ghosts, code in paint drips) but leans on familiar tropes (hidden conspiracy, heroic corruption) without radical subversion.</comment>
