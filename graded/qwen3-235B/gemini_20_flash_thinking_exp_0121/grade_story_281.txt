<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation behind the poetry sessions feels forced despite poetic flourishes; "baffled" trait insufficiently explored beyond occasional references to unease; distinct voice present through poetic delivery but inconsistent emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Rushed transition from poetic performance to personal revelation; structural symmetry between lighthouse transformation and character arc strained by underdeveloped cause-effect; poetic recitation sustains plot but pacing falters under weight of excessive descriptions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Groaning machinery and oily rags create vivid contrasts; atmospheric details occasionally overwhelm narrative momentum; sensory immersion effectively offsets thematic dissonance between lighthouse function and human psychology.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Metaphor of mechanical vs emotional transformation promising but shallowly developed; dialogue with dummy lacks subtextual depth; ending provides thematic closure but emotional resonance remains surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Repetitive "confusingly lucid" phrasing; atmosphere effectively original but vocabulary occasionally succumbs to baroque ornamentation; emotional responses to dummy feel engineered rather than organic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements function individually but cohere unevenly; lighthouse's haunting quality insufficiently tied to transformation theme; tight word count exacerbates structural seams rather than concealing them; final poise shift feels superficial.</comment>
