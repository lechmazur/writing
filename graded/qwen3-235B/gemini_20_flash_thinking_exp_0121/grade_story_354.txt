<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Predicate logic drives character actions, but lacks psychological depth; motivation to chase auroras remains abstract, not grounded in emotional stakes despite cosmic context.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a discernible arc but relies on ex machina mechanisms like "alien frequencies"; pacing uneven in word-constrained segments, though beginning/end cohesion achieved through aurora motif.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Liminal VR space rendered with vivid yet fragmented sensory details; "elegant chaos" tone harmonizes with digital auroras and ghostly wizardry, though tactile/auditory elements underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Imagery-rich craft elevates abstract concepts; subtextual themes of finding meaning in instability resonate through metaphors. Ending's thematic resonance diluted by underexplored emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through surreal tech-occult fusion; some purple prose ("cosmic disclaimers") but mostly purposeful language. Emotional nuance implied through atmospheric shimmering rather than explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Element integration variable; atmosphere/plot coherence maintained despite constraints. Lingering impact resides in conceptual juxtapositions rather than emotional permanence.</comment>
