<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s with inventive combinations of elements, though occasional phrases ("joyful dread") verge on artificiality, and the central conceit risks veering into pretentiousness without deeper subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Story maintains cohesion through focused, imaginative use of assigned elements, though the brevity slightly undermines the emotional weight of its philosophical themes.</comment>
