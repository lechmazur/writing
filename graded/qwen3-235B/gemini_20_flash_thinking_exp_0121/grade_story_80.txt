<question>1</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; traits stated but not demonstrated through meaningful actions. Motivation is nebulous and disconnected from tangible stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is diffuse; action progression feels arbitrary. The tight word limit exacerbates lack of narrative momentum and resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Eerie, immersive atmosphere with vivid sensory details. Setting functions as a character, enhancing thematic tension through decaying grandeur and cosmic unease.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</comment>comment>Powerful imagery and symbolism (spiral/doorknob) elevate craft. Ending lacks emotional payoff; thematic through-line remains fragmented despite individual strengths.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Formulaic fantasy tropes (ancient riddles, haunted inns) paired with overwritten descriptions. Lacks narrative invention; feels like a checklist of mysterious elements.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Elements present but haphazardly assembled. Story fails to synthesize into a cohesive whole, with excessive focus on superficially peculiar details over narrative purpose.</comment>
