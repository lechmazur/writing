<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's arrogance and doubt coexist but lack deeper psychological complexity. Motivation to deliver a "spark" drives actions cohesively, but internal conflicts are implied rather than explored. The singing method reveals vulnerability beneath his bravado, but the first-person voice (if any) remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc of transformation, but the pivotal action (singing) feels abrupt despite setup. Pacing strains within the word limit; tension between doubt and revelation is too easily resolved. Thematic cause-effect works, but narrative momentum falters during abrupt tonal shifts from silence to triumph.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through evocative details: dust motes, echoing walls, tactile sword sounds. The courtyard’s silence and tapestry’s faded colors create poignant contrast. Sensory immersion falters slightly in under-exploiting calligraphy master’s presence as a latent thematic element.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Emotional impact stems from resonant metaphors (clipped wings revitalized) and juxtaposition of "harsh tenderness." The ending feels earned yet poetic, though some phrasing leans toward abstraction over lived experience. Theme of transformation through vulnerability is clear but occasionally drowned in lyrical excess.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Relies on archetypal motifs (faded tapestry, warrior’s revival) without subverting clichés. Overuse of adverbs ("faintly," "desperately") weakens prose. Some details (wedding song connection) feel arbitrarily placed rather than organic. Moments of fresh specificity (sword whispering against leather) contrast with formulaic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively but predictably. The tight word limit sacrifices nuance; symbolic resonance outweighs narrative substance. Writing style elevates the premise, but the ending risks didacticism. Lingering emotional weight emerges from metaphor rather than character depth.</comment>
