<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's cyber-templar identity lacks depth; internal conflict of digital vs. organic is surface-level. Motivation to prove safety's illusion is abstract but not strongly tied to his identity. The bridle's symbolic connection to his past is underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Plot structure suffers from uneven pacing: rushed build-up to the prism's use, unclear resolution. Action (proving safety's mirage via prism) is conceptually clear but lacks logical payoff. Causality for Kael's choices feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (storm's percussion, dim light, cracked bridle texture) create a palpable atmosphere. The sky burial site's skeletal remains enhance the story's existential tension. Setting meaningfully contextualizes the prism's interaction with lightning.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of control vs. chaos and the fragility of safety are present but thinly explored. Strong metaphors (prism as illusion of control, storm as reality) elevate it. Ending lacks emotional weight or narrative closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original premise blends cyberpunk spirituality with philosophical inquiry. Avoids overt tropes but leans on familiar contrasts (tech vs. nature). Language is occasionally overwrought ("patiently frantic") but not excessively flowery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>All elements are incorporated, but some feel contrived (e.g., bridle's relevance). The story's brevity works thematically but hinders full realization. Leaves lingering questions but lacks emotional anchoring.</comment>
