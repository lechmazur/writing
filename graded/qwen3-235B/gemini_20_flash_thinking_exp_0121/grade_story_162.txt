<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character traits feel assigned rather than organically revealed; motivation hinted at through clich√©d "harmony in chaos" abstraction rather than concrete human reasons.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Narrative arc implied through fragmented memory and discovery, but thin progression; tension exists but lacks developed stakes or payoff in constrained space.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lavish, immersive sensory details create mood, though atmospheric effort occasionally overpowers functional integration with plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Mix of vivid imagery and formulaic phrases ("whispered of island memories"); setting elements feel purposefully placed but border on checklist-driven deployment of atmospheric tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Polished prose struggles under self-imposed constraints; elements present but fused with technical adequacy rather than transcendent narrative alchemy.</comment>
