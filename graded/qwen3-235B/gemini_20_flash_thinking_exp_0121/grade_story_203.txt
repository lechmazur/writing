<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara’s stage fright and motivation are integral to her characterization, but internal conflict lacks sufficient nuance. The wildflowers hint at backstory but could deepen emotional resonance. Her defiance against fate feels consistent but underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Exorcism plot follows a clear arc, driven by the key-turning method. Pacing is strained in the climax, where the transition into the ritual feels abrupt. Cause-effect logic holds, but the tight word limit sacrifices some development of tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The orbital debris-toy factory juxtaposition creates visceral atmosphere. Sensory details (sterile air, metallic tang, wildflower scent) immerse readers. The setting’s artificiality strengthens thematic contrasts but could amplify the exorcism’s surrealism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors like “cosmic dandruff” and wildflowers as defiance are evocative but occasionally overwritten. The ending’s thematic clarity (“Never is just a word”) resonates. Dialogue is minimal but impactful; emotional subtext leans heavier on telling than showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés by placing exorcism in sci-fi. Some phrases (“manufactured smiles,” “ballet of debris”) flirt with abstraction. Wildflowers and orbital debris are inventive, but “defiant hush” risks becoming a repetitive motif. Tone avoids artificiality but could embrace more risk.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically tight narrative but feel slightly constrained by their checklist inclusion. The short form works for suspense but limits character depth and worldbuilding. Lingering questions about heritage and fate hint at subtext but remain underdeveloped.</comment>
