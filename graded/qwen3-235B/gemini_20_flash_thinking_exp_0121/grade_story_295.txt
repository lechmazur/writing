<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Reginald’s joviality contrasts his emotional burden, but motivations remain surface-level; his bold reluctance and vow lack nuanced exploration beyond symbolic gestures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The time capsule drives the plot, but pacing feels rushed in transitions between introspection and action; the beginning/end connection is logical but lacks emotional build.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The witch’s garden’s sensory details (herbs, apple tree) and telescope’s eerie presence create strong atmosphere; integration of setting with themes is occasionally disjointed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (buried burdens, telescope as sundial) are effective but underdeveloped; the ending resolves the premise but offers minimal subtext beyond surface growth narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The telescope/time capsule combination avoids cliché, but emotional resonance is often told rather than shown; some phrasing (“elegant mayhem”) feels contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere but lack deeper interconnection; the economy of the short form occasionally sacrifices thematic depth for whimsy.</comment>
