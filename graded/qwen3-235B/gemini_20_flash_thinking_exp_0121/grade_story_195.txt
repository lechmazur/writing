<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character is minimally developed; motivations hinted at but not deeply explored. Inner conflict remains abstract, emotional reactions feel generic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clear arc exists but feels compressed. Pacing is uneven—sudden shifts in emotional resonance lack buildup despite small-scale conflict.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere evocative in brief moments (dying fire, moonlight), but nomad caravan setting remains superficial. Sensory details inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Effective emotional subtext through symbolism (thread, moonlight). Theme of rediscovery resonates, though tone occasionally veers into sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Writing avoids overt clichés but contains faintly mechanical phrasing ("analytically unpredictable"). Subtlety in emotional nuance is uneven.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Elements cohere thematically; brief length feels intentional. Concept of "tidying the soul" adds depth but execution lacks complexity.</comment>
