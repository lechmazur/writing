<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character traits are present but underdeveloped; motivations are stated more than demonstrated through nuanced actions or psychological depth; the reaction to the timbers hints at inner conflict but lacks complexity</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot exists as atmospheric vignette with minimal forward motion; the arrival of the signal feels tacked on rather than organically connected to earlier ruminations; pacing is glacial but partially effective for mood</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is immersive through tactile details of wind, wood, and silence; sensory language creates haunting immediacy; the haunted lighthouse as character itself is exceptionally realized</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric framework (shadows, timbers as memory) and lyrical imagery elevate the craft; ending risks sentimentality but achieves thematic resonance through interplay of past and present</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Occasional purple prose ("whispers of triumphs and tragedies") and predictable ghostly motif; avoids full clich√© through specific details like the crossword's mockery; psychological realism has algorithmic stiffness</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements feel curated rather than organically combined; brevity highlights underdeveloped conflict; atmospheric excellence partially compensates for structural and conceptual modesty; leaves lingering sensory impact more than thematic weight</comment>
