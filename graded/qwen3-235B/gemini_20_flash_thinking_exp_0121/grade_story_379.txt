<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character traits like "ghostly resolve" and "impatiently patient" are stated but not fully embodied through nuanced choices; motivation for cataloguing languages intersects with plot, but deeper integration between his fugitive status and intellectual passion remains underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot progression from stretch to decision feels constrained by word count; the cryptic dare inciting incident lacks emotional weight to justify the "calculated risk," creating a gap in cause-and-effect clarity despite strong atmospheric cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details ground the biodome setting, but the sterile environment's potential as metaphor for dying languages remains implicit; the mechanical hum and artificiality mirror character psychology but could be more explicitly synthesized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong symbolism in the gift tag and disappearing languages creates thematic resonance; the closing metaphor of "fragile bloom" effectively ties atmosphere to hope, but emotional payoff from Jasper's internal conflict remains muted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through unique intersections (legal mind meets linguistic preservation), but high school rival dares border on contrived; characterization leans on excessive metaphorical abstraction rather than organic emotional beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>All elements present but unevenly integrated; the high-concept premise doesn't fully realize its philosophical potential regarding language preservation vs. societal standardization; ends with conceptual promise rather than achieved depth.</comment>
