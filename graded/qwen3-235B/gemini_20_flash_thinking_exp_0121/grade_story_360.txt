<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character remains static; motivation hinted but lacks deep exploration of inner conflict or growth. Nuances of "meekness" and sincerity underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Coherent but static pacing; the cyclical structure (pen-dew reflection-pen) works thematically but lacks dramatic momentum or clear resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setting evokes sensory contrast (playground/underground), but fails to integrate goblin culture meaningfully into the narrativeâ€™s philosophical themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors (broken nib as fractured understanding) and reflective tone engage intellectually, but emotional stakes remain abstract and distant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but relies on familiar mystical imagery (dew drops, tapestries); prose is occasionally lyrical but borders on abstract vagueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Idea cohesion exists but feels contrived; each element is present but insufficiently interwoven to create transcendent thematic unity or narrative urgency.</comment>
