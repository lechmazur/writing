<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation to "discover non-violence" lacks psychological complexity; insomnia and meticulous messiness remain surface traits rather than driving forces. The voice feels overwritten rather than authentic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot lacks forward momentum; confessions-as-metaphor never evolve into concrete stakes. The "subway stops" timeframe creates dissonance without meaningful payoff. Conclusion feels arbitrarily appended.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory immersion in the attic's claustrophobic decay anchors the narrative. Botanical samples and urban decay juxtaposition works well. "Empty abundance" tone subtly permeates settings.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (whispers as systemic violence) operate at surface level. The central conflict between revelation and silence lacks visceral emotional stakes. Ending's "gentler world" feels glibly aspirational rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Relies heavily on gothic tropes (poets in attics, haunted spaces) without subversion. "Drunken confessions" device feels contrived rather than insightful. Some purple prose ("desperate plea for gentleness") dilutes impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements technically coexist but rarely intersect meaningfully. Atmosphere elevates material, but the thematic skeleton remains underdeveloped. Conceptual promise outweighs execution.</comment>
