<question>1</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Inconsistent motivation: Knight's cold demeanor is stated but not thoroughly embodied through actions; sudden shift to artistic awakening via a mitten lacks psychological nuance; folk remedy collector aspect feels superficially grafted onto behavior without organic integration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Fragmented causality: Lost mitten initiating altar-building lacks compelling motivation; abrupt transition from finding object to large-scale subversive project; attempts at narrative arc collapse under word limit, creating artificial resolution without earned emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Underdeveloped contrasts: Cold urban espionage vs. warmth dichotomy remains superficial; secret agent center as setting lacks tangible details; over-reliance on temperature metaphors (cold-warm) instead of immersive sensory world-building to ground thematic contrasts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Surface symbolism: Attempts subtext through altars as emotional resistance but executes through heavy-handed exposition; mitten symbolism telegraphed rather than gradually revealed; attempts thematic resonance between detachment and empathy remain abstract rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Formulaic emotional beats: Tropes of cold-to-warm transformation and redemptive found-object art; overwritten metaphors (e.g., "quiet rebellion of art and empathy") lack originality; emotional shifts stated rather than dramatized through specific character decisions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Forced cohesion: Plot contortions to include all mandated elements (e.g., abruptly conflating folk remedies with altars) undermine narrative plausibility; themes present but under-embodied; stylistic flourishes feel imposed rather than organically developed within constraints.</comment>
