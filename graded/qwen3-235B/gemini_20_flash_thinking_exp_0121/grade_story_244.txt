<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Anya's guilt and "reserved boldness" are established but remain superficial, often stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced actions. The tribal mask motivation feels underexplored beyond being a plot device.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The plot consists of minimal forward motion (dialogue) without a meaningful arc. Logical cause-effect emerges only in the final paragraph, but the confined word count exacerbates structural flatness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Effective use of neon vs. melancholy contrast and sensory details, but the repair shop setting lacks narrative integration with the mask's mystical stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Labyrinth metaphors hint at thematic depth, but emotional impact is diluted by excessive telling. The tone is consistent but lacks distinctiveness in execution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The neon/tribal juxtaposition shows initial creativity but falls into fantasy tropes without subversion. Some ornate phrasing ("electric thrum") suggests stylistic overindulgence rather than purposeful craft.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elements are technically present but cohere minimally - the setting feels arbitrary, the mask's origins unexplored, and the character's arc nonexistent within the constraints.</comment>
