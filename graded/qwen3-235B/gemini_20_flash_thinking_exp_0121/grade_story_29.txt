<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character's naive hope is stated but underdeveloped; motivations lack psychological nuance despite consistent ties to "reclaiming the lost."</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but feels rushed; cause-and-effect resolution lacks earned tension or complication within tight structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocatively described but inconsistently integrated with plot mechanics (e.g., hedge mazeâ€™s purpose feels decorative).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (jigsaw, frequencies) suggest thematic depth, but emotional resonance remains superficial due to heavy "telling" rather than subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Relies on fantasy tropes (knight, magic garden) without subversion; language risks purple prose (e.g., "agonizing bliss" repetition).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Cohesion is superficial; themes hinted at but not interrogated, leaving the story feeling more like a poetic exercise than profound narrative.</comment>
