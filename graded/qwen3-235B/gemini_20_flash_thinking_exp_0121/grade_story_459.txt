<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but psychological depth lacks; "elegantly clumsy" is superficially noted but not psychologically integrated into his conflict resolution or relationship with ghosts. Emotional arcs remain implied rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Narrative progression from observation to artifact analysis is logical but lacks significant stakes or tension; the word limit compresses emotional payoff, making the resolution feel like a philosophical statement rather than earned transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ambient details (shimmering figures, fragile sand structures) create mood but environmental logic remains unexplored; elevator shafts and preservation lab aren't meaningfully juxtaposed to enhance the dissonance concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Symbolic layering (lilies of the valley as "return to happiness") elevates subtext; lyrical descriptions occasionally verge on overwriting but generally enhance thematic concerns about ephemeral beauty and ghostly presence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids horror tropes; the "elegantly clumsy" technician and sand castle preservation lab demonstrate originality; some overwritten metaphors ("dissonant silence") risk formulaic phrasing but are redeemed by the unique emotional lens.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements conceptually connect thematically but lack mechanical synergy; the brevity feels restrictive rather than intentional, with deeper exploration sacrificed for atmosphere establishment.</comment>
