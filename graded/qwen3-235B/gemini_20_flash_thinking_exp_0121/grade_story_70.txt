<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character traits shape actions (e.g., scribe's methodical nature drives adhesive analysis), but motivation lacks psychological depth beyond "buried optimism" abstraction. Reaction to objects and methods shows professional persona but insufficient emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prototype light bulb and adhesive analysis drive plot, but pacing falters during abrupt witch confrontation. Cause-effect between adhesive discovery and bellow feels contrived. The momentary "puzzle piece" epiphany lacks narrative payoff within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (cloying blossoms, fragile filaments vs. earth) create gothic atmosphere, but gravestone-hill setting remains superficially integrated. The greenhouse's role as character/foreshadowing element underexploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (clockwork heart, steel-clad empathy) show textual cohesion. The ending introduces conflict but abandons theme resolution. Subtext about knowledge vs. control hinted but underdeveloped. Emotional resonance undercut by overwriting.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack narrative interdependence (gravestones, Tesla tech). Stylistic flourishes ("quiet transformation," "arms of steel") occasionally obscure clarity. Ambitious thematic scope constrained by brevity.</comment>
