<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character traits like "fierce resolve" and "calm frenzy" are stated but under-explored; motivations for indoctrinating ghosts are abstract and lack visceral context, weakening emotional investment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot stagnates in static contemplation; no clear progression or resolution beyond repetitive letter-writing; the constraint feels limiting rather than purposeful.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with sensory details (bleeding ink, creaking metal) and haunting metaphors, though the "radio static" timeframe remains ambiguously disconnected from the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Emotional resonance is intellectual rather than gut-punching; effective symbolism (ghost costume, ink as fragility) and subtext about comforting lies, but pacing dampens impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on ornate abstraction; "calm frenzy" and "shared dreams" feel overly conceptual; writing style is stylistically rich but occasionally veers into self-indulgent metaphors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Cohesion is fragmented—the elements function collectively but lack seamless integration; the story’s ambition exceeds its execution within the brevity constraint.</comment>
