<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Vague linking of "meekly assertive" to actions. Motivation exists but lacks nuanced connection to peddler identity. Emotional states are stated rather than shown through specific behaviors.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Unusual method feels arbitrarily mystical rather than logically embedded in sci-fi context. Plot progression through rumor-sifting lacks visceral cause-effect. Resolution feels abrupt despite structural symmetry.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Abandoned bay offers strong visual decay, but cosmic humming creates tonal dissonance with methodical archival work. Sensory details present but insufficiently connect to mechanical tasks or emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Metaphors like "key" flowers and "symphony of solitude" add depth, but redemptive arc remains abstract. Ending lacks tangible transformation, leaning on vague cosmic resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Over-reliance on poetic phrasing ("whimsical" flowers unlocking blood oaths) strains believability. Tropes about family curses and redemptive quests aren't sufficiently subverted. Emotional states often told rather than embedded in action.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Premise contains intriguing questions about inherited guilt but fails to fully interrogate them. Elements feel collaged rather than organicâ€”sci-fi setting paired with floral code lacks narrative necessity.</comment>
