<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character traits like "subjectively rational" and "laconic exuberance" are stated but not deeply dramatized; motivations feel intellectualized rather than organically revealed through action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot lacks active progressionâ€”substitutes introspection for narrative momentum; cyclical structure creates minimal arc, with tension between despair and determination feeling underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lush, evocative descriptions of the sky-lounge and endless city create immersive atmosphere, but connections between "garden secrets" and other elements remain abstract and underexploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Employment of symbolism (watch band as mortality, polaroids as memory fragments) and metaphysical abstraction is layered, though emotional resonance remains intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Ornate prose borders on self-indulgent, with phrases like "laconic exuberance" feeling contrived; metaphors are inventive but occasionally strain to sound profound rather than arising organically.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere as a poetic exercise but lack urgency; the narrative functions as a thematic container for assigned components rather than a fully realized artifact with autonomous vitality.</comment>
