<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's shaky mercenary persona lacks depth; motivation for making peace with the past is implied but unexplored. The amber's significance is stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced actions or reactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses through improbable rumor chains, but the rushed climax undermines tension. Cause-and-effect logic is present, yet the story feels truncated, with underdeveloped stakes for the "unknown" quest.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (damp air, crumbling stone, trapped spider) create a haunting atmosphere. The collapsed cathedral’s transformation into an artist haven enhances the theme of decay and hidden meaning.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Symbolism (spider as trapped past, amber as preservation) adds layers, but emotional resonance is diluted by vague subtext. The ending’s ambiguity feels purposeful but lacks payoff for the character’s arc.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on familiar gothic tropes (haunted cathedral, relic-chasing protagonist). Language is atmospheric but occasionally veers into ornate descriptors (“echoing hour”) that feel contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements like the cathedral and amber anchor the story, but the narrow focus on mood over substance weakens cohesion. The brevity serves atmosphere but limits thematic depth or character complexity.</comment>
