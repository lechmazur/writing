<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but psychological depth feels surface-level; trait of 'cynically gentle' doesn't fully permeate actions or decisions beyond surface juxtaposition of baking/revolution</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows coherent trajectory but lacks concrete climax/resolution; use of 'exceed' drives action but remains abstractly defined; pacing balances exposition and symbolism</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through cinnamon scent, light/shadow interplay, and time-machine machinery; some setting elements like 'garage' feel arbitrarily appended</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong symbolic resonance in food-as-rebellion and contagion-as-ideas metaphors; occasionally drifts into 'telling' but imagery remains potent</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality in conceit but some purple prose ('whispers nascent voices'); fresh elements diluted by familiar rebellion tropes and inconsistent tonal control</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Successful fusion of mystical realism with dystopian elements, though overcrowded with assigned elements that occasionally undermine cohesion</comment>
