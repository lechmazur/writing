<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (using love potion via vibration) but lacks psychological depth; actions align with traits but internal conflict feels underdeveloped</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pacing drags despite brevity; subplot about migratory butterflies feels disconnected from main romance, weakening coherence; Morse code resolution lacks organic build-up</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Steampunk submarine's sensory details (humming glass, brass railings) immerse effectively; "battered marvel" tone complements fragile love theme, though political context of broken treaties remains underutilized</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</comment><comment>Striking metaphors (love as currents/butterflies) but excessive abstraction dilutes emotional impact; ending feels abrupt rather than resonant; theme of engineering affection shows promise but lacks narrative weight</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Mechanical phrasing ("conduit for unconventional affections") and repetitive descriptors ("battered marvel") suggest formulaic construction; emotional manipulation concept feels logically mapped rather than psychologically authentic</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements coexist superficially rather than synergizing; brevity exposes structural gaps (love subplot vs science mission), but conceptual audacity lingers thematically</comment>
