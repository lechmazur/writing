<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's traits shape actions but lack nuanced depth; transition from reckless hunter to self-confrontation feels underdeveloped. Internal conflict is suggested but not fully realized through actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Pacing uneven; emotional arc compressed, leading to rushed resolution. Connections between premise, promise, and reckoning exist but strain coherence due to word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (e.g., "cobwebs," "phantom music") immerse readers, but excessive metaphorical fog risks obscuring narrative clarity. Atmosphere evocative yet occasionally overwrought.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Metaphors ("atomize," "map ghosts") deepen theme, but dialogue lacks natural cadence. Ending's thematic resonance clashes with underdeveloped emotional beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Occasional purple prose ("brass and glass relic") and predictable motifs (mist as metaphor) undercut originality. Symbolism is purposeful but occasionally veers into over-explanation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but strain under brevity; themes resonate but linger unevenly. The reflective tone is consistent but sacrifices narrative momentum for abstraction.</comment>
