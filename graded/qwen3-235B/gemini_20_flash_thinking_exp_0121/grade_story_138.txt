<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear motivation through memory preservation, but actions (rebuilding stubs in volatile lab) lack full psychological depth; noble status informs desperation but internal contradictions not fully explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Coherent mood-arc but lacks traditional plot progression; repetitive ritual structure weakens cause-effect momentum despite thematic consistency; pacing uneven in brief sections.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, dangerous atmosphere with specific sensory details (glue scent, sparking wires); lab's volatility contrasts meaningfully with fragile memories; time-frame element (texts) feels slightly grafted rather than intrinsic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</comment>Strong metaphors (ticket fortifications, drone as recklessness mirror) and subtext about memory, but emotional impact diluted by heavy exposition over showing; ending feels thematically resolved yet narratively static.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original concept blending nobility and tech-hazard chaos; avoids most clich√©s but occasionally slips into ornate "lab bench" descriptors; emotional states sometimes told rather than demonstrated through action.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>All elements present and thematically integrated, but short length limits narrative tension; some combinations (creditor texts vs. nobility) feel under-exploited; leaves conceptual impression but lacks visceral punch.</comment>
