<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation (transforming failure) is clear, but the "hopeful sculptor" remains a shallow vessel for abstract ideas rather than a psychologically nuanced figure; reactions to objects lack personal specificity beyond generic symbolism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but hinges on abstract metaphysical transformation (implosion) without concrete mechanics; beginning/end connection is tenuous, relying on repetitive cyclical imagery rather than earned resolution within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere blends quiet museum and ancient fossils effectively, but sensory details (light/shadow, bark texture) are underdeveloped; dinosaur bones feel arbitrarily chosen rather than thematically integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Uses metaphors (light, implosion) and symbolic imagery but leans on passive "feeling" verbs rather than vivid showing; ending lacks emotional specificity or thematic resonance beyond surface-level "hope."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but borders on pretentious abstraction (e.g., "theoretical freedom of creation"); some phrases ("ancient energy," "beacon of hope") verge on overwrought; logical transitions without human emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a visual metaphor but lack narrative urgency; the constrained length emphasizes ambiguity over depth; thematic ambition outpaces concrete execution, leaving ideas underexplored.</comment>
