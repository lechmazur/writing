<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's duality as a faux fortune teller with hidden real visions creates tension, but her shift from frustration to resolve feels slightly rushed without deeper internal struggle.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc, but the vision sequence—while vivid—interrupts pacing; the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through sustained conflict.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bone flute’s symbolism is effective, and the ending suggests thematic growth, but the story leans on familiar rebirth tropes rather than subverting them.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Narrative avoids overt clichés but occasionally slips into lyrical abstraction ("peaceful anger") that obscures emotional nuance, tinged with AI-style overwrought phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially, but the story lacks narrative urgency; its brevity feels restrictive rather than purposeful, sacrificing depth for thematic neatness.</comment>
