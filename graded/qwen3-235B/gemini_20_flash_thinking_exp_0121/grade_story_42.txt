<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's guilt and motivation to restore knowledge are clear but underdeveloped; her internal conflict remains surface-level, blending predictable tropes with faint psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot progression hinges on repetitive action without tangible stakes; the ledger "method" lacks concrete execution details, though the framing of a personal arc within tight constraints works.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The temple's industrial wind turbines clash tonally with the mystical elements; atmospheric details like "whispers" and "faint pen impressions" evoke mood but lack integration into narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Language prioritizes lyrical abstraction over emotional authenticity; metaphors like "skirmish against oblivion" feel weighty but lack visceral anchoring in sensory experience or consequential action.</comment>
