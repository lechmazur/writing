<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lacks psychological depth; motivation to reclaim artistic spark is abstract but consistent, though "fiercely gentle" trait remains superficially demonstrated through repetitive descriptors rather than nuanced behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within constraints, but the leap from blank page to revival feels compressed; narrative logic holds despite streamlined progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Bioluminescence creates vivid visual texture, but atmosphere lacks tactile, auditory details; setting supports theme but underutilizes the exo-atmospheric specificity for emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Occasionally memorable metaphors ("visual whisper of its hidden heart") undermined by overreliance on abstract emotional language; theme of artistic rebirth needs sharper conflict realization.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Some lush but generic phrases ("soft glow on fiercely gentle features") verge on purple prose; exo-atmospheric angle avoids clich√©s but stage-curtain confession metaphor feels strained rather than ingeniously disruptive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elements function but lack transformative interplay; concise structure suggests deliberate brevity but hinges on familiar artist-block narrative; emotional impact remains surface-level.</comment>
