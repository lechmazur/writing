<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character exists primarily as an abstract concept; motivations lack depth and concrete exploration despite consistent thematic alignment with persuasion and forgotten songs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Narrative lacks substantial conflict or resolution; plot progression feels stagnant despite atmospheric momentum. Structurally complete but minimally dynamic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Evocative but abstract sensory details establish mood; insufficient integration of setting elements (e.g., floating tea platform) with core themes weakens immersion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements serve concept but lack narrative urgency; atmospheric coherence distracts from underdeveloped character motivations and thematic payoff.</comment>
