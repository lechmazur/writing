<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character has definable arc and voice, but motivations shift abruptly. The crystal ball's relevance feels forced rather than organically revealing his personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically with clear beginning/middle/end, but pacing stumbles under word constraints. Action sequences lack visceral immediacy despite functional cause-effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sensory details create atmospheric tension between cacophonous jungle and claustrophobic isolation, though some descriptors verge on clich√©d "exotic" jungle tropes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh take on castaway trope by weaponizing "useless" magical object. Avoids purple prose but contains occasional over-mixed metaphors ("bitter honey mask").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Cohesive framework overwhelmed by overcrowded elements. Short length highlights rather than enhances narrative focus. Lingering question about sabotage origins lacks emotional heft.</comment>
