<question>2</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Minimal plot progression; contrived method undermines narrative logic; slim sense of arc from wandering to reading; disconnected shifts between atmospheric description and thematic statement; sluggish pacing lacks rising tension within constrained format</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Evocative visuals undercut by generic descriptors (damp earth, aged paper); atmosphere functions as backdrop more than active element; inconsistent integration between setting and emotional beats; muted connection between physical space and psychological landscape</comment>
