<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation shifts from duty to self-reflection are present but underdeveloped; internal conflict remains surface-level despite thematic ambitions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear arc but relies on abrupt, mystical revelations; tension is resolved too conveniently through metaphysical concepts rather than character action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered but occasionally generic (e.g., "crystal-enhanced light"), missing opportunities to deepen unease or spiritual weight unique to the crypt lore.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of trauma inheritance resonate, though emotional depth is uneven; symbolism (mandala as memory multiplier) elevates subtext, but ending feels narratively static.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids outright clichés but leans on familiar mystical tropes (e.g., "silent screams," "shimmering patterns") without subverting them; prose occasionally over-explains psychological shifts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively arranged but not deeply integrated; the story’s brevity works for thematic concision but weakens character transformation believability.</comment>
