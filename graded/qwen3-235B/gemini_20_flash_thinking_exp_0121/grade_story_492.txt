<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character traits are stated but underdeveloped; motivation feels more like a plot device than an intrinsic force, with minimal emotional nuance or conflicting impulses that could deepen her role as a catalyst.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot lacks traditional progression; tension and stakes remain static despite vivid imagery. The infiltration arc is implied but not meaningfully advanced within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (neon, rain, ozone) create immersive cyberpunk atmosphere. Setting enhances tone but some elements (e.g., "interconnected trails") lack concrete integration into the world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Uses strong metaphors but relies too often on poetic abstractions ("digital alchemy") over concrete action. Themes of creation from decay are clear but underexplored, leaving emotional resonance surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Mixed originality; blacksmith tools as digital instruments are inventive but undercut by overused tropes ("digital spring thaw") and excessive ornamental prose. Nuanced emotional subtext often replaced by broad declarations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements coexist but rarely intersect to deepen theme or plot. The brevity feels limiting rather than purposeful; atmosphere and concept exceed narrative execution.</comment>
