<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character traits like 'sadly joyful' and 'underestimated rebel' are superficially stated but not deeply demonstrated through action or subtext; motivation driven by a phone call and 'stagnant heart' lacks compelling psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cause-effect of the call prompting action is clear, but the connection between cuisine and haunted house feels unearned; pacing is serviceable but lacks tension escalation within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>'Haunted amusement park' and 'ephemeral gloom' are clich√©, sensory details fail to innovatively ground the reader; setting feels like a generic Gothic placeholder rather than an immersive world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Imagery of 'flickering candle' and 'fiery meal' offers metaphorical resonance; however, emotional impact is diluted by repetitive abstraction like 'prime a stagnant heart' instead of showing transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Overreliance on ornate phrases ('swirling vortex of the bizarre') and tropes (haunted house, rebel archetype) suggests formulaic writing; attempts at subversion (hot pot in horror) feel gimmicky rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elements like 'pocket knife' and 'sadly joyful' are mechanically included but poorly integrated; the fusion of horror and culinary passion lacks thematic synergy, feeling more checklist-driven than cohesive.</comment>
