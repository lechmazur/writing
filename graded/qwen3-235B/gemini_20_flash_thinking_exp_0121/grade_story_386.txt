<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Characters exist as archetypes rather than fully realized individuals; motivations are implied rather than demonstrated through meaningful choices or emotional depth. Consistency exists superficially, but lacks nuanced complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Framework follows a basic arc but relies on rapid, underdeveloped transitions. Plot progression hinges on abstract explanations rather than concrete action sequences; resolution feels arbitrary without sufficient buildup to justify the lighthouse's transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details like the atom engine's hum and the tablecloth’s constellations create a haunting, timeless mood. The setting’s mechanical and celestial duality enhances the conceptual tension between stagnation and transformation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors and imagery are potent but occasionally overwrought. The ending offers symbolic resonance, though emotional engagement is limited by underdeveloped character dynamics. The central conflict remains abstract rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Conceptual blending of archaic and futuristic elements avoids clichés; however, phrases like "quiet defiance" and "borrowed dawn" verge on poetic abstraction. The narrative’s reliance on celestial mechanics and mystical science occasionally feels formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesion balances constraint and ambition. Assigned elements are integrated with creativity, though some (e.g., "borrowed dawn" tone) feel underexploited. The story’s brevity amplifies its thematic focus on fleeting hope.</comment>
