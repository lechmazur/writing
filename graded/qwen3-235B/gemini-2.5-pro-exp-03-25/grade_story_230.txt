<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Weak emotional depth; the mage aspect lacks integration with actions beyond juxtaposition. Motivation exists but isn't fully embodied through decision-making.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fairly well-paced but rushed climax feels compressed. Connection between past history and present action exists but lacks gradual tension building.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid decay-tech contrast through tactile details (rusted metal, humming tech) creates immersive atmosphere that enhances mystical and investigative elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (e.g., "metallic scars") and concept blending, but emotional resonance suffers from over-reliance on abstract descriptors over demonstrated nuance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids most AI patterns with inventive mashups (spy submarines + inherited magic), but some phrases ("psychic residue") border on genre convention without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually with thematic synergy between setting and magic-system, though brevity slightly strains character/plot density.</comment>
