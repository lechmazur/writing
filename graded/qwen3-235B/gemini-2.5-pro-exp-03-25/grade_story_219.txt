<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation to map consciousness flows is consistent but lacks emotional depth; reactions to the origami swan and corn husk hint at desperation but fail to fully humanize him.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence through deliberate pacing and a circular structure, but the resolution feels abrupt, leaving the climax underdeveloped within the constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive with evocative details, though the broken clock’s symbolic weight feels thinly integrated compared to the island’s more textured elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of ephemeral understanding resonate, but emotional impact is muted by overly abstract imagery; symbolism is inventive yet occasionally self-indulgent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the origami/consciousness metaphor, though some phrasing ("cool rush of shared awareness") borders on cliché without fully succumbing to predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story’s cohesion is strong, but the brevity leaves certain elements (e.g., fathomless gaze) underexplored; tone lingers, though not with lasting urgency.</comment>
