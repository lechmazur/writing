<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation to master time is clear and ties to actions, but lacks deeper exploration of internal conflict. The concept of 'proud humility' is effectively shown but feels surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot has a clear progression (crossing the chasm) but minimal structure within constraints. Cause-and-effect ties to the harp’s dissonance, but broader stakes remain underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (glitched landscape, silent echoes) create a haunting atmosphere. The classroom quiet is evocative but inconsistently integrated with the digital setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong imagery (organic code, spectral harp) elevates the story, but emotional distance weakens resonance. The theme of manipulating time is potent but only hinted at thematically.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés; metaphors (shattered allegiances as sanctuary bedrock) are fresh. Some descriptors border on ornate, but the inventive fusion of tech and organic elements feels deliberate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere tightly, but the brevity limits thematic depth. The integration of time manipulation and shattered loyalties suggests potential, yet feels unfulfilled within the constraint.</comment>
