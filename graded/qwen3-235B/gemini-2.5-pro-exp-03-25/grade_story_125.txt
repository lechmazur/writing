<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character has clear motivation (confronting limitations) and reacts meaningfully to magical inheritance, but lacks depth in showing gradual transformation beyond surface-level desperation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically from gathering artifacts to activation, but the ending feels abrupt; cause-effect is mostly clear but compressed within word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Abandoned station and farmland create eerie atmosphere; sensory details like static and blinking eyes are effective, but worldbuilding feels thin beyond visuals.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong metaphors ("bored excitement," "cosmic lost-and-found") enhance themes; ending balances tension and closure, though emotional depth remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s in blending sci-fi/magic, but relies on familiar reluctant-hero tropes; prose is vivid without being overly ornate, though some descriptors lean generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive but occasionally strain plausibility (misdelivered packages feel contrived); story ends on evocative note but lacks lingering resonance from underdeveloped themes.</comment>
