<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Leo's motivation (to confront fear) is clear but underexplored; his role as a dog walker lacks thematic integration. The blood drive memory feels contrived rather than organically tied to his character. His "carefully careless" act shows discipline but lacks emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Static setting with minimal plot progression. Begins and ends with Leo standing in the dining room, creating a circular structure that undermines cohesion. The blood drive recollection disrupts pacing with abrupt emotional tonal shifts.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Haunting atmosphere masterfully rendered through sensory details (sunlight through stained glass, creaking floorboard, orchid's tight petals). Timeframe enhances dread. Botanical collection subtly mirrors the mansion's cultivated decay but remains underutilized narratively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong imagery (e.g., "spectral dread") and symbolic silences create lingering unease. Lacks narrative stakes or subtextual richness—relies heavily on atmosphere over meaningful conflict. Ending feels unresolved despite attempts at thematic closure on fear vs courage.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Overly polished prose veers into purple territory ("palpable, loud silence pressed in"). Haunted mansion tropes remain unchallenged. Blood drive memory uses clichéd "quiet strength" without nuance. Sensory details (e.g., "cool glass") occasionally feel checklist-driven rather than thematically purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>High atmosphere but shallow emotional resonance. Assigned elements present but inconsistently woven—particularly the dog walker profession. Length neither enhances nor hinders; lacks lasting impact beyond mood. Shows craftsmanship but limited creative ambition in synthesizing components.</comment>
