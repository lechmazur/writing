<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are conceptually rich but underdeveloped; Silas feels more like a cosmic idea than a fleshed-out persona, with minimal emotional nuance despite poetic descriptions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear heist-structure trajectory but sacrifices resolution for atmosphere; the compact arc works within word limits but feels truncated rather than cohesive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative, original atmosphere with sensory details like "ozone and unshed tears"; however, the nectar facility’s connection to Silas’ role as a collector remains underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (chaotic heartbeat vs. cosmic order) and thematic tension around creation/destruction; ending lacks follow-through on consequences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids clichés but occasionally veers into overly ornate phrasing ("celestial alignments were perfect") that risks feeling algorithmically generated rather than human-curated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive but unevenly integrated; the ending creates lingering questions rather than resonance; brevity serves thematic ambition yet hampers depth.</comment>
