<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation for healing traditions is clear but underexplored; connection between physical clumsiness with herbs and emotional yearning lacks depth; "gracefully awkward" manifested in movements but not in psychological complexity or voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot pivots on coded letter but transitions between nightmares, bike rides, and ossuary feel engineered rather than organic; resolution conflates thematic closure with narrative coherence; pacing fluctuates between languid description and rushed revelation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sensory details like "polished femurs" and "crisp afternoon" create vivid unease; atmosphere supports thematic tension between life/death but ossuary's history remains cryptically undershewed; tone oscillates between poetic and opaque.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Evokes unease through juxtaposition of medical and ecological imagery; subtext about weaponized knowledge vs healing traditions is compelling but overt; ending resolves character arc while leaving larger mythos unresolvedâ€”clever tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Repetitive "bone" motifs verge on gimmicky; nightmares as expository device feels algorithmically convenient; "harsh tenderness" conceptually strong but inconsistently applied to character interactions; language occasionally becomes self-consciously ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements like coded letter and ossuary feel conceptually interdependent yet narratively strained; brevity forces abstraction in key connections; stylistic ambition evident but control over integrating constraints wavers.</comment>
