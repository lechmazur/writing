<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear but character's prudence feels superficially applied. Cheerfulness lacks nuanced connection to action. Some emotional depth missing despite introspective elements.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot relies heavily on internal contemplation over narrative progression. Lack of clear resolution or significant transformation within word limit. Pacing deliberate but underdevelops the central conflict.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Creative fusion of ancient/modern aesthetics successfully creates uncanny atmosphere. Sensory details like digital frescos and concrete acoustics enrich worldbuilding. Integration could be tighter with plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Effective use of symbols (binder ring, water stains) adds depth. Subtle tension between surface plot and historical echoes engages thought. Emotional resonance limited by protagonist's detached demeanor throughout.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s with unique Minoan-punk fusion. Some lyrical passages border on florid but mostly serve mood. Subtly humanizes character through tactile interactions with letters rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Conceptual cohesion admirable but emotional payoff thin. Elements combine smartly but lack transformative synthesis. Brief length serves contemplative focus but limits character/plot depth.</comment>
