<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character exhibits clear motivation (regret and rebuilding), but inventor trait underutilized beyond tech proficiency. Social awkwardness shown through isolation but lacks deeper impact on plot progression. Emotional nuance present but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot follows digital excavation arc with coherent pacing, but lacks resolution or significant change. Action drives introspection but fails to complete narrative circle. Logical flow maintained but stakes remain abstract.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Diner setting masterfully rendered with sensory elements (fluorescent hum, coffee, fridge). Disconnect between physical/digital worlds weakens cohesion. Atmosphere enhances tone but fails to integrate virtual elements spatially.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Metaphoric language (haptic key, forest labyrinth) elevates narrative. Subtext about rebuilding through memory dissection resonates. Ending lacks conclusive revelation, leaving intellectual rather than emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic tech metaphors with unique haptic decryption concept. Subtle showing of emotion through physicality (trembling gut, steady hands). Avoids purple prose while maintaining lyrical precision in descriptions of digital/analog fusion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but occasionally feel compartmentalized (digital vs. physical). Brief length serves meditative tone but diminishes payoff. Invention concept and atmosphere demonstrate creativity through tech-biotech fusion.</comment>
