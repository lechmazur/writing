<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character’s motivation (finding hope in despair) is consistent but relies on abstract introspection over concrete actions; voice lacks distinctiveness despite first-person elements.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot flows logically but lacks narrative stakes or resolution; the action of scattering seeds feels symbolic rather than consequential, weakening arc cohesion within the constraint.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (ozone tang, bruised twilight) effectively immerse; the setting’s decay mirrors the protagonist’s desolation. Timeframe’s symbolic connection to mortality is underexploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (herbs as “hedge,” seeds as prayers) elevate the narrative; themes of mercy vs. despair resonate, though ending leans on melancholic abstraction over emotional transcendence.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally veers into lyrical overwriting (“charred serenity”). The speed dating encounter feels tonally dissonant, and character reasoning could feel more humanely impulsive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Cohesive in tone and theme but strained by underused or forced elements (speed dating backstory). The restrained length sharpens focus on existential tension but limits narrative depth.</comment>
