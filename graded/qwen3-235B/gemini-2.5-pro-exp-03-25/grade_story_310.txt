<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character traits like 'wide-eyed' and 'methodically chaotic' inform actions, but inner conflict remains underexplored, making motivation feel more conceptual than emotionally grounded.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent and contained, though the resolution’s brevity sacrifices tension; the action is logical within the worldbuilding but lacks escalation or stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Aquatrine’s bioluminescence and machinery create vivid atmosphere, but sensory details often prioritize aesthetics over immersive functionality, leaving the setting feeling occasionally decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effective use of silence as symbolism, but emotional resonance is undercut by distant narration; the ending’s thematic closure feels slightly predictable rather than piercingly insightful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story’s tight focus works well, but integration of assigned elements feels uneven in depth; the ending’s quiet triumph is satisfying yet lacks lingering complexity.</comment>
