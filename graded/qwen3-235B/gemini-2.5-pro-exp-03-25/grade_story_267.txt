<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strength lies in Elara's consistent non-interventionist motivation shaping her disguise and observational method, but the "mild temper" attribute remains underexploited as a defining character trait.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cohesive in its philosophical questioning but compromised by uneven element integration, particularly the cats' symbolic role feeling imposed rather than organically developed.</comment>
