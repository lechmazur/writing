<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation (saving park, defying genetic decline) is clear but underexplored emotionally; his actions align with desperation rather than depth, though the tremor's physicality adds visceral tension.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence through static-driven mediation as central action; resolution feels abrupt but thematically consistent. Pacing avoids rushing by interweaving personal and fantastical stakes within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Worldbuilding excels through evocative metaphors (memory of fire as cosmic energy, decaying theme park). Sensory details (peeling paint, static) anchor surreal elements in tangible reality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Story evokes melancholy resilience through parallels between Alistair's body and the fairy core. Symbolism (fan as conductor) elevates theme, but subtext about performative diplomacy could deepen.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s (fairies as abstract voices, negotiation over battle) but leans on "mediator" trope. Language is purposeful without excess, though cosmic terminology borders on vague.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements (walkie-talkie, memory-fire) intertwine organically despite premise absurdity. Themes of balance resonate beyond plot, though brevity limits character introspection.</comment>
