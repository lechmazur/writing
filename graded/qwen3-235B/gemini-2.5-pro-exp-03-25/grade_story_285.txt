<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Attempts to weave hesitation and awkwardness into actions, but motivations feel overly explained rather than organically demonstrated through behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ritualistic emergence drives plot, but the abrupt shift from internal monologue to action risks coherence; the "bridging" concept lacks sufficient foundation prior to the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Geothermal vents and tundra create a starkly visual atmosphere; sensory details like "hoarfrost" and "frosted breath" immerse, but emotional resonance of the setting occasionally overshadows narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Subtle symbolism (shells, blank postcard) deepens themes; pacing struggles in short span, though thematic cohesion and metaphorical bridges evoke lingering reflection despite abrupt ending.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original metaphors (hermit crab systems) intrigue but verge on overabstraction; avoids overt clichés but occasionally leans on "frigid" and "frost" repetitions that border on formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a functional micro-narrative, but some—particularly the crab-shell analogy—feel more conceptual than organic; style elevates material but doesn’t fully transcend short-story constraints.</comment>
