<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is implied through internal conflict but lacks nuanced exploration; emotional complexity hinted at but insufficiently developed through action or dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a meditative structure with clear beginning/middle/end, but progression feels static; tension between memory and present is resolved too abstractly within word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting creates evocative sensory contrasts (industrial vs. garish lake), but underutilizes deeper symbolic potential for the timeframe and atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (seesaw as guilt-metronome) and layered themes, but emotional impact diluted by overly introspective narration without visceral character revelation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but operates within familiar psychological guilt narratives; language is purposeful but occasionally risks ornate description without subtextual innovation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but lack narrative urgency; ambitious conceptual interplay exists without achieving transcendent emotional or stylistic uniqueness.</comment>
