<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation for compassion over revenge is clear, but character depth beyond surface traits remains underexplored. "Cautious impulsiveness" shown through action, but lacks psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Linear progression driven by leaf pattern and airplane timer maintains coherence. Pacing feels slightly rushed in mechanical gate-opening resolution, but beginning/middle/end structure is intact within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Evocative decay through sensory details establishes oppressive atmosphere. The amusement park's contrast with grim reality and leaf patterns enhancing setting work exceptionally well.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Powerful imagery (paper airplane as countdown) and theme of legacy vs. cruelty resonate emotionally. Subtext and show-don't-tell execution could be more refined.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids most genre tropes with inventive use of leaves/bent fork. Some slight overuse of "gloomy" descriptors, but original mechanical logic and atmospheric contrasts demonstrate human creativity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements function organically within tight word limits. Lingering emotional impact from compassion theme and atmospheric contrasts elevates narrative beyond surface plot.</comment>
