<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation to sever ties with Elodie is clear, and his synesthetic memory-tasting ability shapes his introspection. However, his personality beyond grief and resilience feels underdeveloped, and emotional nuance in his reasoning borders on overly logical.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The rain-trail method drives internal plot effectively, but the transition from memory to resolution feels compressed. Pacing struggles with conveying a full arc within constraints, and cause-effect between past betrayal and present growth lacks layered buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Vivid contrasts between sterile stadium and alpine memory enhance mood, but yodeling valley feels underutilized as more than a flashback backdrop. Sensory details (synth-herb taste, rain sounds) immerse but occasionally verge on overwrought metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (stadium silence vs valley calm, rain trails as emotional mapping) add depth. Ending avoids saccharine forgiveness clich√©s but leans slightly on "hopeful flavor" vagueness. Theme of painful authenticity vs artificial resentment resonates through concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic emotional beats via unique synesthesia premise and layered metaphors. Some phrases ("watercolour smudges," "seabed after wreck") border on poetic excess but mostly earn their resonance. Emotional progression feels humanly inconsistent in places.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but unevenly in execution: synth-herbs and stadiums anchor the modern setting while rain/yodeling valley evoke nostalgia. Some choices (paperclip's symbolism) shine, while others (yodeling specificity) feel loosely connected. Lingering question about memory's role in healing remains.</comment>
