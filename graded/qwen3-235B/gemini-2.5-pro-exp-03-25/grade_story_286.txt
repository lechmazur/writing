<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation is conceptually strong but lacks depth in connecting her past role to present actions; character's internal life feels selectively revealed rather than fully dimensional.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot progression stumbles between atmospheric details and action; cause-effect between folklore and system glitches lacks tight linkage, undermining tension within word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (e.g., "bio-luminescent pathways") effectively immerse, though some setting elements (drowned city) feel underexploited for atmospheric tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong symbolic interplay between vinyl shard/folklore and the garden's "remembering" elevates thematic resonance; ending achieves quiet emotional momentum without melodrama.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Folklore-on-napkins method feels original but occasionally borders on contrived mystery-building; avoids most AI-tropes but occasionally leans on poetic density over narrative clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Premise and themes are compelling, but elements like the vinyl record and napkins demand more narrative payoff; cohesion achieved but not fully transcendent.</comment>
