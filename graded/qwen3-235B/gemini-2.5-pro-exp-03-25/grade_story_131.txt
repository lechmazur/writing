<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's aloofness and orphan status are evident but underexplored. Her motivation to transform fear into courage drives actions, but deeper connections to her past as an orphan could enhance depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical and紧凑, but the ending feels truncated. The transition from discovery to decision lacks a fully satisfying emotional payoff within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (humming anomaly, vibrating stones) create a compelling atmosphere. The gravitational anomaly enriches mood but feels underutilized as a narrative force.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (stones as anchors, hum as fate) and layered tension between detachment and adaptation. The ending resonates thematically but lacks poetic closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Avoids genre clichés by intertwining the anomaly and emotional growth. Language is precise without excess ornamentation. Stone symbolism and nuanced fear-to-courage arc feel authentically human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere around the theme of adaptation. The anomaly's role could be more pivotal, but brevity enhances focus. Leaves lingering questions about the stones' true nature.</comment>
