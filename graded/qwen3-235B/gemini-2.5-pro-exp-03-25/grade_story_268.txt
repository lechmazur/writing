<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are stated but lack emotional depth; traits like "subdued vigilante" and "artfully clumsy" are performative rather than internally motivated, creating a silhouette rather than a fully rendered psyche</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot adheres to constraints but feels truncated; core action (tracking via mirror) drives momentum, yet the resolution lacks sufficient weight or transformation, leaving narrative threads unresolved</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid, decayed textures (dust, warped glass) immerse readers in a desolate, war-scarred world; the abandoned setting mirrors the character's isolation but occasionally relies on familiar dystopian shorthand</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (mirror distortions as "language") elevate the narrative, but the ending’s thematic ambiguity feels underexplored; tension is palpable but the story’s philosophical ambitions remain undercooked</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes (ancient martial art, vigilante justice) through specificity, yet retains traces of genre formula; the funhouse mirror mechanic feels fresh, while the "price of war" theme leans on abstraction rather than visceral subtext</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Cohesion is strong despite packed elements, but the story’s scale dilutes its emotional and philosophical payoff; the tone remains compellingly austere, though some choices prioritize mood over meaningful integration</comment>
