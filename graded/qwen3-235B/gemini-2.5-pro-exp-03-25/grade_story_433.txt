<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation transitions from seeking power to rejecting it, but her "demure audacity" lacks demonstration through meaningful actions, and her hardheadedness feels underexplored beyond repetitive searching.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but the transition from ambition to disillusionment is underdeveloped, slightly undercutting the emotional weight of her transformation within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting details (ice, snow, ephemeral art) evoke transient beauty, but the connection between the gallery’s fragility and the theme of power’s cost remains superficial despite vivid imagery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., wildflower as lost beauty) and the circular ending evoke reflection, but emotional resonance relies partly on exposition (diary entries) rather than subtext or character introspection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés in premise but risks occasional "telling" (e.g., stating characters are "broken") and generic descriptors ("mosaic of past griefs"), undermining subtlety without veering into overt formulaicity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive but unevenly integrated; the art gallery’s thematic role feels underexploited, and the brevity sacrifices deeper exploration of character or theme.</comment>
