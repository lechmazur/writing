<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character motivations are hinted at through inherited duty and symbolic artifacts but lack deep psychological exploration despite lyrical descriptions of her role as a musician. Actions align with duty but emotional resonance remains sparse.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear crisis-resolution arc with external stimuli driving action. Pacing is efficient but the ending feels abrupt. The wind chime-triggered deviation introduces tension cohesively though some causal connections are thin.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evocative, layered atmosphere with the ship’s recycled materials and "biolume panels" creating tactile immersion. Sensory details like rattling chimes and warped records deepen the setting’s melancholy tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (e.g., "energy signature as a guiding hand") and cosmic symbolism. Subtext about legacy and impermanence emerges subtly, though emotional depth occasionally relies on poetic abstraction over visceral impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids tropes with original concepts like wind chimes as gravimetric sensors, but some phrases ("savage grace") lean into stylized contrivance. Language balances lyrical precision with occasional over-ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but not seamlessly unified—the vinyl record and wind chimes feel integral while the "mark of trust" and "savage grace" lack deeper narrative purpose. Themes resonate but execution borders on precious.</comment>
