<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Limited by brevity, but Elias' duality as a rattled exorcist facing intellectual provocation from Thorne creates tension. His inwardly social trait feels underutilized, though reactions to the postcard and hidden room reveal psychological depth. Motivation to confront supernatural threats remains consistent but lacks explicit personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The puzzle-driven plot progresses logically from postcard to hidden room. Pacing compresses time unnaturally (solving puzzles in an hour feels rushed), but the tight word count maintains momentum. Beginning/end connection works thematically (confronting darkness) if not emotionally. Cause-effect remains clear despite accelerated timeline.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The psychic facility's juxtaposition of psi-dampeners with tango lessons creates striking cognitive dissonance. Sensory details (ozone scent, pulsing light) immerse readers, though underdeveloped. The setting meaningfully connects to the postcard's history and Thorne's scientific hubris. Atmosphere effectively contrasts social vibrancy with occult menace.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ending evokes visceral dread through juxtaposing "synthesized" psychic energy with religious terminology of damnation. Subtext about science's ethical limits emerges organically. Some "telling" weakens impact, but the containment field's description and Elias' "cold dread" effectively "show" conflict. Central theme of entwined wonder/doom resonates.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids extreme clichés through specific details (tango lessons, Victorian séance postcard) but leans on familiar mad scientist/exorcist tropes. Writing style balances precision and atmosphere without excess ornamentation. Thorne's motivation feels archetypal rather than human-nuanced. Sensory language (ozone's "older" scent) adds memorable specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively despite constraints. The dance-tango contrast with occult investigations reveals creative thinking. Brief length serves the contained mystery structure well. Ending raises philosophical questions about scientific ambition, leaving lingering unease. Some rushed elements prevent higher score.</comment>
