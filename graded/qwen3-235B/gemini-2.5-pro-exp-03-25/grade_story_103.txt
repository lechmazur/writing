<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Character’s motivation (hushing regret) is clear and drives the emotional arc, but his voice remains static with minimal distinct traits beyond generalized longing. The reaction to symbolic elements reveals internal conflict effectively, though deeper nuance in his persona is lacking.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The action of analyzing the reflection directly fuels the plot, with a coherent, complete arc in the tight word limit. Pacing is efficient, though the resolution feels slightly rushed; cause-effect between past choice and present realization is logically intact.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse prison and mirrored courtyard contrast effectively (isolation vs. vibrancy). Sensory details like salt-scars, crashing waves, and the lion’s head knocker vividly enhance mood and theme. Atmospheric coherence is exceptional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Emotional impact is strong, blending regret and grudging hope. Symbolism (arrow of items, dented armor) and subtext (sacrifice vs. duty) add depth. The ending balances ambiguity and closure, with layered themes of self-forgiveness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in using a knight’s introspection rather than action-driven plot, but some phrases (“joyful agony”) risk cliché. Sensory details are specific but occasionally ornate. Avoids overt tropes but could refine subtlety in emotional delivery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Cohesion is strong, with elements (e.g., lighthouse, knocker) interwoven purposefully. Length feels deliberate, ending on a resonant, reflective note. Style aids clarity despite ornate descriptions, with a lingering emotional duality prompting deeper consideration.</comment>
