<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s somnambulist duality is intriguing but underdeveloped; her humility feels more like passive acceptance than an active trait shaping decisions, and motivations remain surface-level despite consistent alignment with her role.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot coherence hinges on intuitive leaps rather than cause-effect logic; pacing balances exploration and revelation unevenly, with the ending feeling abrupt despite the cyclical framework.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (damp soil, pulsing light) and the lab’s decay create an immersive, eerie atmosphere that deepens the mystical tone and mirrors the thematic tension between science and nature.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The layered metaphor of "living glyphs" and interwoven spiritual/scientific threads evoke thought, but emotional resonance is diluted by abstract introspection; the ending implies continuity without catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original fusion of somnambulism and occult science avoids cliché, but occasional overwrought phrases ("hum of loaded curiosity") and underdeveloped conflicts suggest formulaic tendencies beneath the lyrical surface.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements merge into a thematically cohesive whole with lingering resonance, though the brevity leans on implication over execution; the pilgrimage structure feels imposed rather than organic to deeper character stakes.</comment>
