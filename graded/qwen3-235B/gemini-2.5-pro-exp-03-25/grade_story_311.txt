<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation and actions align, with the photograph and overheard stories effectively revealing internal conflict. Some surface-level emotional nuance limits higher score.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with clear cause-effect, but pacing feels rushed in parts due to word constraints. Missing subtle narrative depth for higher impact.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere and sensory details (e.g., lunar greenhouse, Earthlight) are vivid and immersive, though some descriptions risk decoupling from plot progression.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (photograph, escape) and subtext. Tension and themes of freedom vs. control are well-executed, but dialogue is minimal for deeper impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s with unique setting, but motivation and tone occasionally lean on familiar emotional arcs. Prose is purposeful but occasionally overelaborated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements cohesively support theme and tension. Brief length feels purposeful, though some interplay between character and concept could deepen further.</comment>
