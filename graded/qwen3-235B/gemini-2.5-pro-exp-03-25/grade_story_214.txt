<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character is conceptually rich but static; motivation is clear but psychological complexity is implied rather than explored deeply. The sea glass reveals backstory but feels more symbolic than emotionally lived.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Minimalist structure works for the form but lacks narrative momentum. The action (resuming decoding) drives subtle progression rather than dramatic escalation, making the plot feel slightly amorphous despite thematic cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric construction: the floating observatory's gravity-defying precariousness mirrors the protagonist's emotional state. Sensory details (nebulae, projector hum, sea glass texture) create immersion without excess exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Poetic language elevates craft—metaphors like "black hole of doubt" resonate thematically. Subtext about energy transformation as metaphor for grief is compelling, though some passages risk ornamental abstraction. Ending creates philosophical resonance rather than conventional resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original in concept and execution—with fresh metaphors (gritty whimsy) and emotional architecture. Avoids genre clichés by framing sci-fi tech through personal trauma. Some phrases verge on overwrought ("the fiercely hopeful discovery") but generally maintain purposeful diction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements harmonize effectively: brevity feels deliberate, each assigned component (sea glass, observatory) works symbiotically to explore transformed energy and memory. Leaves a lingering thematic imprint about luminous possibility within loss.</comment>
