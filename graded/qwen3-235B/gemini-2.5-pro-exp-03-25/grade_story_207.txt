<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rationale: Motivation for breaking the oath is clear but lacks emotional depth. Actions align with her methodical approach yet fail to reveal significant internal conflict. The "meekly assertive" voice remains inconsistently executed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Issue: The data-sifting action drives the plot but lacks tension. The beginning-middle-end structure exists perfunctorily; the abrupt "clean hope" conclusion feels unearned despite tight word constraints. Resolution lacks narrative heft.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strength: Sensory details (nebulae's "secret song", rustling bouquet) immerse readers. The medical bay's sterility contrasts effectively with dried flowers. Atmosphere powerfully embodies "joyful loneliness" through cosmic-scale isolation juxtaposed with purposeful activity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mixed: Strong metaphors ("digital chaff", "cartographer of deceit") elevate prose. Subtext about truth in gossip works well. Ending's "clean, bright hope" breaks immersion by stating emotion rather than demonstrating it through action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dual: Avoids genre clich√©s with gossip-as-espionage method but relies on overwrought descriptions ("cosmic hum", "digital detritus"). Emotional beats are shown through actions but verge on formulaic "lone wolf hacker" tropes. Prose oscillates between poetic and purple.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Balanced: Elements cohere thematically but lack transformative innovation. The concise format works thematically but limits emotional payoff. The central tension resolves too neatly despite artificial constraints.</comment>
