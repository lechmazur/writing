<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Weakly defined motivation and underexplored personality nuances; traits are visible but lack emotional depth or transformative consequence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically but feels compressed; beginning/middle/end coherence strained by word limit; cause-effect chains (specters → overload → ruler resolution) require suspension of disbelief.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sensory richness anchors atmosphere; dissonance between twilight playground and airship setting weakens spatial cohesion; tonal consistency maintained despite conceptual clash.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and metaphor elevate the work; theme of wonder vs. fear resonates; emotional resonance constrained by underdeveloped character stakes and abrupt resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original combinations (ruler over lute, cold "heat haze") defy formulaic choices; avoids overused tropes through specific details; lyrical prose balances precision and evocativeness without excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements function synergistically but not indispensably; length works aesthetically but limits thematic complexity; memorable yet lacks lingering philosophical weight.</comment>
