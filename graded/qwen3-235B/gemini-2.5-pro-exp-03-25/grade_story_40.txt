<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Distinct voice in Finn's cynical narration, but motivation for disrupting tradition and lingering guilt remains ambiguously sketched rather than deeply embodied through action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elegant micro-arc between isolation and human connection, but plot progression leans heavily on contrived weather device; resolution feels slightly underdeveloped despite tight word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory layering—vanilla-dread juxtaposition, algae-tank whispers—create a hauntingly tactile world where every detail reinforces themes of neglect and reinvention.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Potent symbolism (soldier's missing arm = fractured redemption) and ironic subtext (cosmic cycles vs. tiny human gestures) culminate in a quiet, resonant meditation on shared limbo states.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre shortcuts through idiosyncratic metaphors ("algae-nibbler") and tonal precision; no purple prose despite rich imagery, maintaining emotional authenticity through restrained show-don't-tell.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements interlock like recipe ingredients—reincarnation fuels cynicism, weather enables connection, guilt binds caretaker and soldier—creating thematic cohesion that transcends brevity.</comment>
