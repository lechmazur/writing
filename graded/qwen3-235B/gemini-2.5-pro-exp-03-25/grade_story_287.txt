<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lacks deeper character voice and behavioral nuances beyond stated traits; internal conflict is conceptually present but underdemonstrated</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong central concept but struggles with tight pacing; cause-effect between the phone's pulse and final action feels underdeveloped within constraints</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rich visual atmosphere with strong sensory details, but deeper integration between 'careful wildness' motif and plot mechanics is missing</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors and layered thematic resonance between lost knowledge and solar cycles, though emotional beats could be more viscerally shown through action</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into ornate abstraction; the 1920s phone strains plausibility despite narrative purpose</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cohesive core, but some elements (phone especially) feel like plot devices rather than organic components; atmosphere compensates for structural tension</comment>
