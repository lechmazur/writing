<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Presents clear motivation and connection to brewing, but lacks deeper emotional complexity or personal conflict beyond external goal. Actions align with traits but character remains broadly sketched rather than deeply realized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Moves from discovery to resolution with satisfying cause-and-effect logic. Pacing is mostly tight, though some atmospheric passages slightly slow momentum. The beginning/end framing works effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evocative decaying-scientific setting masterfully rendered through precise sensory details (skylight grime, ferrocrete, boot texture) that mirror thematic decay/hope. Timeframe between empires informs ambient tension without over-explanation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (dust motes as ghosts, scuffed door as historical text) and resonant symbolism (boots as legacy vessel). Ending carries emotional weight through tactile connection between past/present efforts. Subtext about postponed salvation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through specific historical context (empire transitions) and occupational texture (brewer/researcher overlaps). Some phrases ("whispered starlit conversations") mildly generic. Emotional progression feels earned rather than stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into thematically unified whole despite tight word count. Uses brevity effectively for mystery/denouement structure. Leaves lingering questions about implementation but maintains focus on symbolic resolution.</comment>
