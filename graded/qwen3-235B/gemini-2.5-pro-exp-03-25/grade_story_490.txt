<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character has distinct traits but lacks emotional depth and evolution beyond established quirks. Motivation is consistent yet underexplored in terms of psychological underpinnings.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Meandering structure without clear progression or resolution. Pacing suits introspective atmosphere but fails to establish meaningful plot momentum within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere vividly rendered through precise sensory contrasts (sterile tech/organic lavender, salt air vs digital glow). Setting deeply informs thematic concerns of decay and hidden knowledge.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Powerful use of metaphor and symbolism creates lingering resonance. Nuanced portrayal of obsession versus transient humanity. Stylistic flourishes enhance rather than obstruct theme.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh subversion of tech-organic dichotomy avoids predictability. Minor instances of slightly familiar phrasing ("newborn galaxy"), but generally inventive conceptual combinations maintain distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong cohesion between elements with minimal redundancy. Brevity feels intentional but limited conceptual payoff. Atmosphere triumphs over narrative substance.</comment>
