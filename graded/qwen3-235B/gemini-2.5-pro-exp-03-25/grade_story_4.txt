<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lyra's playful attribute is evident through her interaction with the god but lacks deeper exploration of her internal motivations. Actions align with traits but only superficially develop her as a character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The linear structure (filing → vision → mapping → filing) is coherent but lacks tension or significant stakes. The sweater-thread method is logically integrated but doesn't fully propel the plot forward.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (ozone, glowing fungi) create immersive atmosphere, though the greenhouse's endless night setting remains more decorative than integral to Lyra's cosmic cartography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("staccato bursts of insight," "cosmic cartography") elevate the prose, but emotional impact is diluted by Lyra's detached narration and lack of character stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés with inventive combinations (sacred-space mapping via headphone-channeling dj), though occasional ornateness ("whispering nebulae") slightly detracts from narrative urgency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>All elements are tightly incorporated, but the story's thematic weight ("mapping sacred spaces as divine communion") feels understated. The brevity serves the contemplative tone but limits emotional payoff.</comment>
