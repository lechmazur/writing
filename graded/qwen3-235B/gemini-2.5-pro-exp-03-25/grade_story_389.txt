<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character's traits (thin-lips, formally casual) are superficially described but lack psychological depth or evolution. Motivation via 'hunger' and 'raw gnawing' feels clichéd, not unique. Reactions to the artifact reveal obsessive drive but not complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Optimization action drives plot but resolution feels incomplete – leviathan's awakening is ambiguous, undermining narrative closure. Cause-effect logic (e.g., how 'cures' amplify danger) is vague. Pacing juggles exposition vs. tension unevenly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully crafted: decaying library's dust motes, ozone-tinged rot, and liminal mine setting fuse sensory dread with thematic decay. Timeframe contrasts stagnant microcosm against external linear time, deepening eerie disconnect.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Imagery (spectral ballerinas, bloodless smiles) is visceral, but subtext about knowledge-as-addiction remains underexplored. Ending's unresolved tension hints at thematic depth (cost of obsession) but lacks emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but relies on familiar necromancy tropes (forbidden rituals, doomed hubris). Sensory details (salt-spray residual terror) are evocative yet occasionally overwritten. Kaelen's certainty lacks human nuance – more caricature than character.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere visually but some (timeframe) feel perfunctory. The economy of language is precise yet prioritizes style over emotional resonance. Lingering unease is clear, but thematic clarity falters under baroque prose.</comment>
