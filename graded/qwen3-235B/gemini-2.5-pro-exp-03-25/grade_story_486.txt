<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character has consistent, clear motivation but lacks emotional depth beyond surface actions; clumsy dexterity shown but underutilized in driving narrative tension; distinct voice absent despite first-person-adjacent perspective.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clean cause-effect structure with logical progression, but pacing feels compressed in key moments (studio-to-plaza transition); clear arc within constraints though resolution lacks emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (oscillators' hum, velvet-like quiet) establish mood, but underutilizes "witch's cauldron" setting to explore deeper metaphysical connections between sound and silence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical use of silence-as-presence and layered critique of modernity; inconsistent execution of "show don't tell" with explicit statements about motivation undercutting crafted atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s with inventive concept (reality-warping sound engineer) and pantomime-as-protest; some purple prose ("maddening roar") but maintains distinct voice and fresh subtext about urban alienation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements work cohesively though unevenly weighted; brevity feels intentional but underdevelops thematic connections; leaves lingering question about silence's power dynamics but lacks emotional payoff.</comment>
