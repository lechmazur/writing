<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but lacks emotional depth; his 'dismayed' state and 'subjectively rational' approach are present but insufficiently nuanced to provoke deeper engagement.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot progresses via Kaelen's archival work, but the arc is incomplete; the ending feels suspended rather than resolved, undermining cohesion within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Richly textured atmosphere (neon, velvet, bioluminescent moss) immerses readers, though the setting’s timelessness occasionally dilutes tension between permanence and transience.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Imagery and metaphor are effective (garden secrets, "concrete ocean"), but the story leans on descriptive prose over emotional resonance, leaving thematic undercurrents underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés; metaphors like "excavate layers of manufactured permanence" feel fresh. However, recurring phrases like "endless night" risk veering into overwrought abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce around Kaelen’s obsessive quest, achieving atmospheric cohesion. The clipped form suits the theme, though the narrative’s unresolved tension feels more stylistic than purposeful.</comment>
