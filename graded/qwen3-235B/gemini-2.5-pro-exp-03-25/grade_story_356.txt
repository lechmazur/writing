<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivation (escaping "what ifs") remains abstract, with actions (mapping spacetime) only loosely tied to psychological depth. Dialogue with crewmate feels perfunctory rather than revealing nuance. Wry, aloof voice lacks consistent textual embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vanishing act creates satisfying endpoint, but chalk's method lacks clear internal logic. Plot progression driven by atmospheric details rather than causal momentum. Pacing drags in technical descriptions; abrupt transitions weaken structural coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere through transparisteel viewport imagery and Cygnus Veil descriptions. Sensory details (chalk texture, dial tone) immerse effectively. Cargo hold setting's mechanical decay contrasts poetic spacetime mapping, enhancing thematic tension between order/chaos.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Memorable metaphor (time as nebula) and poetic imagery elevate craft. Ending achieves resonance through ellipsis rather than explanation. Subtext about temporal regret is strong, but emotional impact diluted by overly abstract execution; balance between showing/telling imperfect.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but contains minor AI-esque phrasing ("humming crate's dull ache"). Chalk-to-vanishing mechanism feels original yet underexplored. Metaphors fresh but occasionally opaque. Emotional nuance present in atmosphere more than character interiority. Style maintains consistency despite ornate passages.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story coheres through atmospheric unity rather than tight element integration. Chalk/vanishing concept creates memorable core, but some elements (dial tone, hydro-spanner) feel tangential. Brief length serves contemplative tone but undermines deeper character exploration. Lingering ambiguity works thematically, though imperfectly.</comment>
