<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Weak emotional depth; motivation is clear but lacks nuanced internalization. Actions align with traits, but character remains largely symbolic rather than humanized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive progression but lacks narrative tension. Cause/effect between method and outcome feels logical yet insufficiently explained, leaving gaps in emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Imaginative setting with vivid details (void, starlight), but fails to ground ethereal elements in visceral sensory experience or thematic purpose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (shards as possibilities), but emotional resonance undercut by passive narration and underdeveloped subtext about preservation vs. loss.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original concepts undermined by inconsistent tone shifts and ornate phrasing ("brewed starlight"). Shows ingenuity but veers into self-indulgent prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</question><comment>Elements are tightly woven but lack deeper thematic payoff. Story feels deliberate in structure yet shallow in existential or emotional resonance.</comment>
