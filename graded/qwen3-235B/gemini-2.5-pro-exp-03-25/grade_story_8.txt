<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sufficiently consistent but lacks emotional complexity; motivation is clear yet under-explored, reliance on cerebral rebellion sacrifices deeper psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Chronological execution is disciplined and purpose-driven, though the arc feels constrained by the word limit’s compression of philosophical stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evocative textures of sound garden and chalkwork merge into a metaphysical atmosphere that sustains the story’s conceptual tension with visceral immediacy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors like pillow-stuffed paradox and cosmic dance achieve poetic resonance; pacing occasionally falters but overall maintains intellectual seduction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aversion to tropes is admirable, but occasional flourishes (“captured thoughts,” “fluid melodies”) veer toward abstract vagueness rather than original specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Narrative cohesion transcends element accumulation; the marriage of form and theme feels deliberate, though the final impact leans more on elegance than profundity.</comment>
